I know there was this hype about VR in the past which kind of died out as investors slowly found out that it's not mass-market ready yet. However, I've got my first VR set (quest 2) recently and I am loving it. This lead me to thinking that so many other people would too. And it's not even expensive (price of an average smartphone). I have seen that number of Steam VR users are rising as well (even though it's still a small % of overall Steam users).

Anyway I believe there is a huge potential in this sector and that it's importance will rise. Mainly in gaming. Sooner or later I expect there will be 360 full-length high quality movies, apps for educational purposes and even work related apps and stuff.

Where would you recommend to invest in order to get wet with VR? My current dilemma is that VR exposure in big tech companies such as Facebook or Alphabet and even gaming companies like Activision or EA is very small compared to their main businesses and I feel like I am not really investing in the VR segment.
Any recommendations?

Or perhaps any arguments why you think that VR is not The thing of a future?

Thank y'all üòò_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Netflix earnings report beat, possible buyback Revenue: $6.64 billion versus $6.63 billion expected

Earnings per share: $1.19 versus $1.36 expected

Global paid subscriber additions: 8.51 million versus 6.03 million expected

Netflix said Tuesday it plans to be cash-flow neutral this year and cash-flow positive every year after 2021, and will no longer need external financing to fund its operations, ending a decade-long trend and vindicating investors who have plowed money into the company despite its cash-burning ways.

Netflix also said it will consider share buybacks, a practice it hasn‚Äôt done since 2011 ‚Äî the last time the company was cash-flow positive. The announcement came as part of Netflix‚Äôs earnings announcement, where the company also announced EPS of $1.19 on revenues of $6.64 billion for the fourth quarter, and 203.66 million global subscribers, up from 26 million at the end of 2011. Shares were up about 10% on the news.

For the past 10 years, Netflix has upended the media industry by taking a leap of faith. It has spent billions of dollars on licensed and original content each year to boost its catalog, and along the way morphed into a replacement product for traditional pay-TV in millions of households. Since 2011, Netflix has raised $15 billion in debt to help pay for this content. The company said it plans to pay back its outstanding debt that matures in 2021 with its more than $8 billion of cash on hand.

Over the years, Netflix skeptics, such as Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, have pointed out that Netflix‚Äôs increasing debt load should be concerning for investors as content spending ballooned and the company burned more cash.

‚ÄúNetflix has burned more cash every year since 2013,‚Äù Pachter told CNBC in June 2018. ‚ÄúWhat happens when they need to keep increasing their spending and suddenly they have $10 billion of debt? People are going to start asking, ‚Äòcan this company pay us back?‚Äô If that happens, their lending rate will spike. If Netflix needs to raise capital, they‚Äôll issue stock. And that‚Äôs when investors will get spooked.‚Äù

But that hasn‚Äôt happened. The cost of original programming hasn‚Äôt doomed the company. And Tuesday‚Äôs announcement suggests it won‚Äôt. Meanwhile, as Netflix has grown, the number of U.S. households with traditional pay TV has dropped from a peak of 100 million in 2012 to about 75 million today. Media executives are now planning for a world where that figure falls to between 50 million and 60 million in five years.

Netflix‚Äôs market capitalization in Jan. 2011 was $11.5 billion. Today, it‚Äôs more than $220 billion.

Pandemic quarantines have jump-started Netflix‚Äôs return to positive cash flow. With production stalled amid coronavirus shutdowns and people around the world stuck at home, Netflix added 36.57 million subscribers in 2020 while spending less money on content than usual. Last year, Netflix reported positive quarterly free cash flow for three consecutive quarters for the first time since 2014.

The acceleration in subscribers and subsequent movement of all media companies toward streaming has given CEOs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos confidence that Netflix will be able to limit churn and start consistently making money.

Netflix investor narrative

The unknown question is how investors will respond to the change in Netflix‚Äôs narrative. While operating a sustainable business without the need for outside debt and share buybacks is ‚ÄúBusiness 101,‚Äù Netflix‚Äôs stock has risen as investors have increasingly come to the conclusion that Netflix would make good on that promise.

‚ÄúWe intend to be a much larger and much more profitable self-funding company over time,‚Äù Hastings said during Netflix‚Äôs 2019 first-quarter earnings conference call. ‚ÄúThat is the path we‚Äôre on. As we talked about in the letter, we‚Äôre committed to improve our cash flow profile meaningfully, starting in 2020 and then each year thereafter.‚Äù

As Netflix‚Äôs days of cash burn are behind it, it‚Äôs possible Netflix may need a new Wall Street narrative to convince investors its future growth story is worthy of the company‚Äôs lofty valuation.

Perhaps that new narrative will be the complete toppling of pay-TV with a Netflix-centered bundle of streaming services. The entire entertainment industry has reorganized to prepare for such an occurrence with each major media company developing its own streaming service in the past year or so.

But it‚Äôs also possible rising competition from Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia and others may stagnate Netflix‚Äôs subscriber growth. Investors could punish Netflix for share buybacks instead of using it for more content. Activist investor Daniel Loeb has pushed Disney to eliminate its dividend to focus more on new original programming.

If Netflix is choosing to use excess cash for buybacks, it may be because Hastings and Sarandos think the company‚Äôs status -- and ability to raise prices in the future -- is so strong that they can start to transition the company into a new, more mature phase without seeing a subsequent loss in value.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

"If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts," Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**"Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it," Yellen said at the hearing. "And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers."**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in "full support" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the "existential threat" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When to show yourself the door.

3) Is anybody currently investing in oil worried about what could happen in the coming days?

Thanks ü§ôüèº_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A stock split is never indicative of performance. Please read. I too was one of the younger investors in my life that looked at the Apple split in 2008 as this gold rush. Apple has split again and the stock continued to churn, along with Tesla right behind it. However,  regardless of what you believe a stock split has nothing to do with the direct performance of stock appreciation and especially today, there is no reason to do one at all. Fractional shares are a common offering on every United States brokerage now.

Even in a nonfractional trading world. Let's say Amazon does a 10:1 split. $3,000 into $300. That's great. People that couldn't afford 1 share of Amazon now can. If Amazon, has quarter over quarter of shit earnings with no growth, that split is not going to carry any weight. Yes, more access to buy leads to appreciation, but retail does not move the needle. Hedge funds do not give a rip about the price of a stock. They care about discounted cash flows and investment trajectories.

People continually reference Apple, one of the most profitable companies of all time, with a generational product that had record QoQ and YoY growth as a reason splitting makes sense. There are market cap weight funds, but ignore those sentiments. On a pure dollar for dollar trade. It does not matter if there are 10 shares of a company, 1,000 shares of a company or 1,000,000,000 shares of a company if the reason they got there was due to a split.

AutoZone is worth over $1,000 a share. Ford is worth $9. Ford is the more expensive stock at 35B vs 28B with $AZO.

Berkshire Hathaway is worth over $350,000 a share.

Chipotle is worth over $1,400 a share and McDonalds is worth $210. McDonalds is worth 5x Chipotle.

It's all relative to market cap.

**Market capitalization = Total shares issued x price**

**There is no way to split this in any way that you can make the stock appreciate.**

Read a book on accounting. Please stop spouting nonsense about stock splits throughout the investing subreddits, because you don't understand how it all works. **And again, none of this all matters with fractional trading.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 5 Stocks: Sell or Hold?

I'll preface this saying this post is simply a long-term outlook on $SENS based off information I've gathered while being an investor. 

I've held SENS stock since 2019 as part of an investment into diabetics CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) - in the meantime i've been up 100%+ on players in this field (Dexcom and Abbott) and pretty average with $SENS until this week. Got into it because my nephew was diagnosed with T1 diabetes requiring a CGM. My sister is an ER anesthesiologist and has been trying out a bunch of different CGM's on the market. 

SENS's offering is an implantable CGM that offers a long term solution (90 days) which is larger than the 14 days that is currently available for implantable sensors. This means fewer doctor's visits and fewer under skin implants, and it reduces the size of related products that a patient needs to carry around. The downsides here are obviously the competition from the giants in the field (Dexcom and Abbott) as well as consumer pushback due to having to repeat the insertion at a doctor's office every 90 days. General consensus i've heard from parents w/ diabetic children is that $SENS's product is the superior offering but hard to access at the moment when Dexcom and Abbot's products are way more common (and covered by more insurances).

Today, the stock raised on news that it was approved for coverage by health giant EmblemHealth for 2.9 million more potential people.  They also announced a $50 million direct offering yesterday. With signs pointing towards more revenue, some fine tuning of their product could propel them to the top of this sector as more insurance companies accept them.

All of these catalysts on top of a business meeting that is taking place at 10AM EST on 1/26 which I anticipate will announce a bump in their 2024 financial projections in addition to hyping up these announcements will only take this stock even further.

AND let's not forget that soon to be president Joseph R. Biden Jr. is a believe in clean energy & more specifically hydrogen. When he reveals his Build Back Better Plan in February you can darn well expect another bump in Plug Power. (Reminder Chuck Schumer, D-NY senator is close with Andy Marsh the CEO of Plug Power, is a believer in Hydrogen, and will make sure that Plug Power's mission gets pushed through legislation in any future clean energy plans)

Here is Biden's stance on clean energy [https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) . You can find Hydrogen mentioned 5 times in this webpage alone.

These are the exact questions to ask when proceeding to do your own DD when you see something a random stranger online posted. I can't emphasize this enough, please do your own DDs!

Here are my exact responses to him and I hope it helps you do your own DDs!

>It really does. As mentioned, I have no way to validate their claims about the ARCUS being more precise than CRISPR. The science behind it is unfortunately also outside of my wheelhouse. I have not found any "buts" to ARCUS vs CRISPR at this point. I guess the only "but" I can think of is because it's proprietary, not a lot of information about it is out there in the public. CRISPR is well known and there are much more information out there about it. It is also well understood that there are challenges associated to the CRISPR method of gene editing, in particular with the random errors that occurs.

To be clear, these are not tests specifically on the ARCUS platform. They leverage the ARCUS platform in development of their product candidates. DTIL have not yet been able to assess the safety and efficacy of most of their product candidates in humans, and have only limited safety and efficacy information in humans to date regarding one of our product candidates

Companies like this will need deals such as Eli Lilly's recent partnership, or through rounds of raising cash to survive. Expect quite a bit of volatility till we reach that point. The bright side to this is that they are operating in parallel in two sectors (Food, Medicine). Elo Life Systems also leverages the ARCUS platform in developing sustainable/healthy agriculture products. They also have agreements with other companies that bring in revenue for them in this front. Revenue in this sector doubled in 2019-2020 (150k - 300k). Where as revenue in therapeutic sector saw a 50% increase (4.7m to 7m) from 2019-2020.

The issue with genetical diseases are that, using this kind of therapy would only be effective in preventing genetic diseases like Down Syndrome if it was detected early enough as a fetus. A full grown adult would likely not see benefits to gene editing unless it's to target diseases like cancer or late onset diseases like Alzheimer.

I don't know if this is the proper sub for this question, so if not, please let me know.

I've been trying to understand options for a good couple of weeks now, absorbing as much information as possible.  There are some questions that I still have lingering though, and i'm hoping some of you could help out.

1. Can you sell an option before the expiration date?  I ASSUME you can, but i'm not 100% certain on that.
2. Why is time against you exactly?  This is the one that I truly cannot comprehend for some reason.  I know of the Greeks (roughly) but why with a far future expiration date, would an option become less and less valuable?  Using an example, if I bought a call option for 1 year in the future (Jan 21), at the end of the day, if the price hits breakeven by the expiration date, that breakeven stays the same regardless correct?  Whether it be the first day after purchase or the last day before expiration; am I correct in saying this?
3. Why would someone choose a higher or lower strike price exactly?  Using CRUS as an example (99.95 at the moment), why would someone choose a call option to buy at 90 or 110?  If someone expects it to go up, wouldn't it make sense to choose the lower option?  I understand the ask would be higher, but is there anything else that I may be missing?

I apologize for all of the 'entry-level' questions.  I'm just trying to learn at the moment.  I'm not looking to make any moves, just trying to soak up as much info as possible on how options work.

# Aurinia: The Underdog

# Context:

First off, the voclosporin drug Aurinia's been working on is up for FDA approval on Friday, though it's their only project as of right now, and that's probably why the stock is down for 1y. The government in the U.K. already approved a drug for the same disease (Ticker GSK) a month or so ago, the stock all but stayed the same. Though, it's rumored that Aurinia's could be far better.

Aurinia had a massive jump back in Feb. 2017 due to a combination of project news, a lot of institutional buying, hype, etc. though shares came back to reality (-30%ish) after a insider share lockup period ended. Gives me Nikola vibes. Eew.

Also got cannoned up in late 2019 mainly due to project news.

Disease name is lupus nephritis, if you want to do more research on their drug.

**Financials and Growth:**

Not profitable in the slightest, at least as of right now. 60m in total liabilities, but a surprising 1 million dollars in debt (To banks/institutions) which is far less than expected. Around -.28 EPS as of Q3, but that may soon change, with the ongoing project and it's offshoots. They've been operating at a large loss

**Current and Future Revenue:**

Now, onto the JUICY stuff! Projections and guesswork galore!

Well, as far as current... there is none. The reason why they have so much (55%) institutional shareholders is because of the fact that they haven't had a single million dollars roll through the bank and they need a constant medical bag full of funding from the big boys on Wall Street.

As far as the future, AUPH's leadership team has put together a plan of ruthless investment into their pharmaceuticals to make themselves a big player in Canada. That's part of the reason why they blew through 100m+ last year.

With this drug they're making, well... Let me just tell you the details.

GSK, the company from earlier, has it's headquarters in and mainly operates in the U.K. Aurinia, however, operates in both Canada and the U.S.

The disease is named Lupus Nephritis, or autoimmune disease. It's a worse case of normal lupus, and is far more deadly. There's currently no cure, and doctors around the world almost always only tread the symptoms.

If their drug is good enough to provide stable treatment of the actual disease itself, then they could be in for billions in revenue as they expand around the world. My current projection is 5.5bn by 2025, and 1bn if something goes wrong along the way.

Aurinia as a company is rated as \~70% undervalued, taken from a total of around 20 stock analysts. They're negative as far as revenue, though if this drug becomes widespread, they could become very revenue positive (Can't say profitable just yet, might not happen 'til 2022 or later)

Other info:

* A whopping 90% of analysts have price targets above APHA's current share price!!! Holy cow!
* Every line of resistance imaginable points to an rocket in either direction, though they point more upward than downward. There's been a wedge for the past year, and an FDA approval Friday could turn this into either a WeWork or a Tesla. We will see.

I also want to note that the site that I use for DD is rating Aurinia's fair value at $110. So... Value + Growth stock? Fatal disease curing spurred Tesla-like breakout? We'll find out Friday!

***TL,DR: Stock could go up 50%+ on approval, or it could go down -50%+, as this one drug is basically it's entire future. Revenue with FDA approval could be as high as 5bn by 2025.***

*How I'm playing it: (Not financial advice,* *~~don't get me arrested~~*\*)\*

I plan on buying a whole bunch of shares, doing a risky call spread with Feb. expiry, then buying a LEAP and/or selling a put or two. Should come out to 3k to 10k, depending on how much money I want to possibly erase off the face of the Earth.

As of writing this, it's up 4% in premarket already. The news is starting to get around a bit.

Also, if someone from Canada here can tell me what the prices are early on CSX, that'd be great.

thanks for coming to my TedTalk. This is my first time doing in-depth(ish research like this, so give me all the criticisms your hearts desire!)

Also, Theta Gang for Life._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VRCA I posted about Verrica Pharmaceuticals a while back, but here to post one last time.
They have positive news out this morning. VP-102, a drug theyre currently working on, presented positive feedback in clinical study.
It is currently sitting at $11 with a price target of $21. If they get this approval, which i feel like is more of a when, it could exceed that price target. 
This is my opinion but I have been following it for quite some time. Figured I'd give you all looking to buy something to look into.
Goodluck._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | Stimulus Bill | TSLA, NKLA, GME & other Stock Market News [01-19] **Biden unveils the $1.9T stimulus package proposal. Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of the last few days as I haven‚Äôt made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won‚Äôt be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn‚Äôt go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden‚Äôs propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don‚Äôt expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It‚Äôs likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don‚Äôt have a good fundamental basis.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden‚Äôs pick Janet Yellen‚Äôs [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

"No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent & experience, fails to use a checklist" - Charlie Munger

4. Margin of Safety - Only buy things on discount to value due to temporary distress, giving an adequate margin of safety which can protect us from the uncertainty of the future and possibility of error in our calculation.

Note: These are just 10 principles of the many principles in investing, they are not the only 10 principles to be followed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Against Value Investing in 2021 ‚Äì Why an intrinsic value of a stock does not matter when majority of other investors do not care about intrinsic value. Disclaimer: Logic outlined below only applies from March 2020 onwards until the eventual stock market crash. After the bear market hits, absolutely please revert back to value investing.


Value investing is hard work ‚Äì it requires the investor to evaluate the intrinsic value of a stock by careful analysis of the financial statements, researching company‚Äôs present and planned future state and looking out for any political factors. You could easily spend 1 week just researching one stock to convince yourself that you are ready to invest say $10,000 into that company.

So it is understandable that most retail investors do not bother to do their due diligence before investing in a company. It ought be noted that sub 100 word posts on reddit with rocket emojis shilling another meme penny stock does not count as DD by any measure of the word diligence when you look it up on the dictionary ‚Äì ‚Äúcareful and persistent work or effort‚Äù. 

If anything, doing your due diligence might harm your gains in this unprecedented bull market. A stock could go up 3 x times in that week it would take you to do your research and you would have missed the boat by then already.

So, what determines the value of a stock to begin with? Intrinsic value plays a part, however ultimately it is the investment community BELIEF in what the stock is worth. It does not matter if the intrinsic value of a stock calculated after careful research is $10. IF the investor community at large believe and are willing to pay $100 for this stock, the value of the stock will climb to $100.

An intelligent investor in 2021 should not waste their time doing their due diligence trying to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock, INSTEAD they should spend their time gauging the opinion of the general investor community to evaluate what they BELIEVE the stock could be worth.

Consider the following example. 

A value investor in Jan 2021 might ask themselves: should I invest in PLUG as a topical example. The company has never made a profit and is currently is in net debt. However due to their forward-looking technology, a reasonable investor might say a fair value is around $10 to $30.

Meanwhile at the same time, a rookie investor browsing reddit in Jan 2021 might ask themselves, should I invest in PLUG? They do some research on reddit and find the company is already up at $60, however with the company still having significant meme potential and the sustainable energy / EV boom currently ongoing, the reddit investor might say: this bull run will run for a while so there is no reason to say PLUG won‚Äôt reach $100 by end of the year. By that logic, investing into PLUG at $60 is very reasonable and intelligent, you could make a near 2 x return in a short time frame.

To sum up: being ignorant of the intrinsic value of a stock can be profitable just before the end of a bull run being propped up by artificial manipulation of interest rates by the federal reserve. If you want to make any serious profits in 2021, I‚Äôd suggest to give up any pre-conceived notions of value investing and ride the wave until it lasts instead of sitting on the side-lines._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying IPOs early Over the relatively short time I have been getting into stocks and shares investments I have seen a few new companies I know declare IPOs.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Gotta call them tomorrow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RIGL - Potential magic bullet found for Covid and non-Covid Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a relatively small biocompany with a market cap hovering around $600m. Their drug Fostamatinib was approved for the treatment of ITP by FDA in 2018 and EMA/Canada approved in 2019/2020. They've seen reasonably strong year over year growth (\~39%) and this year will have made just over $60 million in net sales (and around $40 million in recognized revenue from other sources).

There have been a few exciting studies that have been released this passed year about Fostamatinib's potential role in the treatment of Covid and non-Covid ARDS which can be an enormous opportunity for a current unmet need.

Some background on Fostamatinib is that it was approved for the treatment of a disorder called immune thrombocytopenia which causes the immune system to destroy blood platelets. It's also in a stage 3 study which is being fast tracked for a disorder called warm auto-immune hemolytic anemia. wAIHA destroys the red blood cells and the company is confident this will also be approved. The interesting thing about how this factors into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is that National Institute of Health released a study showing that fostamatinib prevents neutrophils too from being destroyed when introduced to patient serum who have severe covid symptoms. It's believed that this neutrophil destruction is what's causing most (if not all) the severe covid symptoms. When neutrophils are destroyed their contents spill out and cause a condition called NETosis; basically sticky web-like traps start to form in the patients blood, or even lungs, which can lead to thromboembolic events and acute respiratory distress. Fostamatinib is currently the only known drug that can prevent covid NETosis.

Additionally, early in the year Harvard and MIT researchers released a study where they indicated the protein mucin-1 as being a potential target for Covid-19 as they found it to be elevated in patients with severe symptoms. Mucin-1 is released by goblet cells in the lungs and can be found in great abundance in Covid-19 patients, much more than normal. Normally, this protein can serve to protect the lungs from viral or bacterial invaders but too much can clog the lungs and make it difficult to breathe. The researchers ran a scan of 3700 drugs in their database and found only one FDA approved drug that can inhibit mucin-1 and preserve cell integrity - fostamatinib. The interesting thing is that this finding is believed to apply to more than just Covid ARDS but may potentially tie into viral and bacterial pneumonias as well as conditions such as cystic fibrosis among others.

Further, early in 2020 the University of Amsterdam determined that patients with severe symptoms were having what is called a cytokine storm. Cytokine storms can cause difficulty breathing, and potentially lead to tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events. They determined the mechanism that was causing this cytokine storm was the production of anti-igg antibodies. When they took these antibodies from severe patients and placed it into serum without the severe symptoms they were able to replicate the cytokine storm in vitro. They understood that SYK inhibition could likely block this cytokine storm from taking place and used the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib in vitro and demonstrated complete inhibition.

Due to the number of different targets fostamatinib may play on severe covid it's believed that results from the covid clinical trials will be unprecedented. Further, the company is hopeful that these results will be a springboard into the treatment of non-covid ARDS as well. The National Instiute of Health with the help of Inova, as well as the Imperial College of London, and the company itself are all conducting separate studies.

Just as an aside, in 2019 before Covid was a known entity the company had completed a rat study where they were able to prevent acute lung injury using fostamatinib.

Beyond Fostamatinib the company has a robust drug discovery program. They currently have an Irak1/4 inhibitor and a RIP1 CNS program that have completed phase 1 clinical trials.

Partnerships for Covid and RIP1 and non-dilutive funding sources are in the works. The company will end Q4 2020 with about 55million cash on hand, and a 40m credit facility they can draw down on.

From what I know, they‚Äôre using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat major depressive disorder. This method has been used for the past decade now, and has been very effective in treating depression. Since COVID is causing the world to isolate, psychiatrist offices are completely booked right now due to depression. Usually, pills like SSRIs are prescribed first and while they might work for some, others might not react well to them or refuse to take them. This is where Neuronetics ($STIM) comes in and gives them a noninvasive, more effective option. I believe that as more people opt for this, psychiatrists will begin to prescribe this as their go to for treating depression. $STIM has already treated over 3 million people with this method and is proven safe with less side effects than pills. 

If you search up ‚ÄúTMS therapy‚Äù on Google, Neuronetic‚Äôs Neurostar website is in the top 5 results. Past quarter revenues look constant $10M+ and I think it could 3x-5x because of the pandemic. 

EDIT: [Harvard article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-for-depression-2018022313335) that states TMS has been 50-60% effective in patients where pills didn‚Äôt work for them, and 1/3 of them whose depression went away completely.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/l0ayq6)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Deep Dive AUPH: FDA Friday Looking to generate some discussion off of what I'm posting here. Any and all criticisms/thoughts are appreciated.

**AUPH**

Interesting newish company based on what I‚Äôm reading. But I do have some legitimate concerns/foundation that I want to layout here before anyone starts pulling the trigger.

Lupus Nephritis: autoimmune disease that inflames the kidneys. Impacts 1.5 million Americans and 5 million people worldwide (these numbers are weirdly off, and I will refer to this later). As it stands right now, Lupus is NOT treatable and often leads to further complications later in life, even death. As of right now, there is only the mitigation of lupus. Over the counter anti inflammatories (think Tylenol) to corticosteroids. Steroids have long term impacts, so they are most often paired with medications like hydroxychloroquine (lmao), but they take potentially up to months to feel the impacts of the medication.

[Voclosporin](https://www.auriniapharma.com/our-programs/about-voclosporin): is the new drug from Aurinia Pharm. pending FDA approval Jan 22nd. It‚Äôs differences from the standard of medication for lupus now are properly displayed in the hyperlink, no need for me to go over that again here.

**What‚Äôs the catch? Isn‚Äôt this perfect? Revolutionary drug for a niche market?**

There are a couple of concerns that I have regarding AUPH and the entire market regarding lupus (mainly involving other competitors). As it stands, there is already another company that is significantly larger than Aurinia. GlaxoSmithKline has 48 BILLION in revenue (and 100k employees) to Aurinia‚Äôs 88 MILLION (and 62 employees). However, in some cases this could be seen as a good thing. In this situation, I see it as both a blessing and a curse and I will go over why.

GSK‚Äôs share price barely moved when they got FDA approval for their drug to treat lupus. Could this be because of how large of a company it is, or because it‚Äôs drug didn‚Äôt have that much of an impact?

Based on sources that I‚Äôve read, the GSK‚Äôs drug Benlysta has a lower efficacy than AUPH‚Äôs. However, I don‚Äôt think that really makes a huge impact on GSK‚Äôs share price. To be quite honest, no idea why it didn‚Äôt increase back then.

Back to what I was saying in regards to efficacy. Voclosporin is apparently [2x](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03021499?cond=Lupus%2BNephritis&lead=aurinia&phase=2&draw=2&rank=1) as effective as modern medicine and is taken orally, instead of an injector like GSK‚Äôs. More effective, less pain = good news.

Low share price, good entry point, apparently good cash at hand, a better drug, where do the problems start? Like I was saying with a small company both being a blessing and a curse, this is where my concerns show up. AUPH simply doesn‚Äôt have the representation that companies like GSK and others that would be entering this market do. If a deal somehow arises after the FDA approval to help with commercialization, then there would be BIG $$$ made. As it stands right now though, I have some fears.

**Share Price Thoughts**

As it stands, AUPH is trading at 13.31. Took a hard hit on Friday as most did stocks as people lock in profits for a long holiday weekend. After a deeper dive into the technical analysis though, we see this:

[https://prnt.sc/x6ej2d](https://prnt.sc/x6ej2d)

Death cross with a STRONG downward trend in both the 200EMA and 50EMA as of Friday close. Could this be because of the sell off? I‚Äôm honestly not too sure.

I feel as if this is both a good and a bad thing. The 50EMA and 200EMA trending down is never good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. UNLESS you are planning to buy. If you‚Äôre looking to invest into this company, I could see the share price going down even more and you can in turn get even more profits by buying at a lower price. Significant negative mean (bottom graph) but it might start to tick upwards a bit. I‚Äôll definitely keep my eye on this and see whether or not it will continue trending downwards before the FDA approval (which apparently has a 95% approval).

**The Numbers**

The numbers people seem to be pulling on how much revenue can be generated seems to be off. We need to be more realistic in our estimates given how many people are actually going to be using this product.

I am finding varying sources regarding the amount of people truly impacted by lupus. For the sake of clarity, I am going to use the date straight from [Aurinia‚Äôs write ups](https://ir.auriniapharma.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-17-075811/d313671dex991.htm), which show that of 500,000 with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, ‚Äú40-60% experience renal manifestations of the disease resulting in inflammation of the kidney‚Äù. To be pessimistic, I will be using 40% as a safe calculation for the numbers I will be crunching shortly.

In the United States alone, let's see how many people are actually going to be needing this treatment. 500,000 \* 0.40 = 200k.

The COST of this drug is also interesting. I‚Äôm finding a clash in sources, the site I referenced earlier says 50-100k, but a lot of comments and such in other places are all stating 60k to be the mean. I‚Äôll just use 60k considering it‚Äôs on the lower side of the estimates and I guess seems reasonable.

Now this isn‚Äôt just a one time end all be all drug. It is going to cost a whole 60k YEARLY. That‚Äôs literally someone‚Äôs entire salary.

200k \* 60k = 12 BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

Considering voc has the potential to be the best drug on the market, it should feasibly be able to take up a reasonable amount of market share. Even 10% would generate 1.2 billion dollars a year. And this is on the LOW side. AUPH generates less than 100 mil a year, so this amount of money would be absurd.

**Final Remarks**

I am still VERY weary about this play. There is a significant amount of both good and bad. Looking to see if anyone else finds any news/insight on this company. I can‚Äôt truly predict where this stock is going in the short or long term. When phase III trials came out, it mooned. But will it have the same success? Will it even get FDA approval?

I am seeing a lot of ‚Äúoh, there‚Äôs a 95% chance of this going through and being approved!‚Äù **NO CLUE WHERE THIS NUMBER IS COMING FROM**

Someone is pulling this out of their ass. I‚Äôm doing my best to search and surf the internet and try to find % chances on this.

I also don‚Äôt know how much FDA approval will truly moon this given COVID and everything. Yeah FDA approvals are great and all, but given COVID how will mass production and commercialization even start for AUPH, especially when they‚Äôre such a small company?

Can this go up if it gets FDA approved? Sure. Can it go down? Technical says it‚Äôs trending that way.

Long term? If it gets a nice partnership or bought up by another company I can see big money being made. I‚Äôm too scared as of right now, but will definitely keep my eye on it to see where it heads and whether or not I am the next Buffet.

There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty here, but risk can bring reward. I would think about opening a position in this if I can find more information that makes me more confident on the FDA approval.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LOGI Q3 Earnings Blowout... expecting other gaming companies to follow suit 1) Q3 sales were $1.67 billion, up 85 percent in US dollars and 80 percent in constant currency, compared to Q3 of the prior year.

2) Q3 GAAP operating income grew 248 percent to $448 million, compared to $129 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew 222 percent to $2.22, compared to $0.69 in the same quarter a year ago.

3) Q3 non-GAAP operating income grew 214 percent to $476 million, compared to $152 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP EPS grew 192 percent to $2.45, compared to $0.84 in the same quarter a year ago.

4) Cash flow from operations was $530 million, compared to $181 million in the same period a year ago.

This obviously destroyed expectations, and this might actually gap up Tuesday morning. If we extrapolate a little and consider the fact that the majority of their revenue came from gaming and computer peripherals, we might expect similar results from other publicly-traded gaming/peripheral companies (e.g. $HEAR, $CRSR, $RZZRY) and e-commerce giants like $AMZN.

What if I switch the calls to shares after a year?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Un Popular Opinion: NIO - Tread Carefully Living in Shanghai, China has really helped me stay ahead of the curve on Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and spotting trends. Something I have noticed more over the past month is that the European automakers are selling more and more EV's in the Chinese market. So much so that I am spotting them driving daily more than what makes me comfortable being an early NIO investor. 

Let's be honest about a few things: 

1. Chinese have a lot of disposable income.
2. Chinese love buying European things.
3. Do you really think that NIO, LI, or XPEV's interior and design is better than Germans?
4. NIO delayed their ET7 Sedan until the beginning of 2021 nd their 1000KM battery until the end of 2021. The German sedans are on the roads now. 

Yes, I get it Tesla is going for more of a minimalist interior, but there as far as a luxury vehicle goes - it is kind of lackluster.  I've driven and owned a lot of German cars over the years, in China, and they are still more popular than anything right now in the big cities on the East coast of the Middle Kingdom. 

**How will this affect my NIO stocks?**

By no means am I fear mongering and saying we should all sell Chinese EV stocks now. However, I do believe the Chinese EV companies will start loosing market share. NIO will still hit $100 eventually. I just want to make you aware of the changes taking place on the streets here and you can form your own opinions. Personally, I will not take as big positions any more in these companies, and I will start turning toward more of an EV infrastructure play because no matter who is selling cars they will all need to be charged. Not to mention XPEV's NGP 3.0 might be a game changer in China - more to come on that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys think of the top tech companies for 2021?

My average buy price is $15ish. So, now wouldn‚Äôt be a bad time to sell but should I? I live in Denmark and we have mean tax laws which in short- let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôd have to pay a helluva lot in taxes if I sold everything now. If I keep it for five years and sell like 20 % each year it would save me a lot in taxes.. but if the stock drops 50 % by then, it obviously will not have been worth it. 

I feel like the risk of it dropping to anywhere near $15 again is very, very small. It was only ever that cheap because risk of bankruptcy which I don‚Äôt believe is present anymore. I do, however find it realistic it would drop to somewhere around $30 or maybe just below that level but I find it more likely that it won‚Äôt and even if it did I think it would climb again and stabilize somewhere between $40-$50. 

Nordstrom excels in omnichannel fulfillment with one of the best curbside pick up experiences around and while it is also big online its digital sales continually increase in percentage of total revenue. CEO Erik Nordstrom recently said he considers Nordstrom more of an e-commerce business than a department store. I think on the other side of the pandemic, apparel retailers who do well both online and as brick and mortar will outperform. People are possibly a bit tired of buying clothing online and having to return more than half of it because the size wasn‚Äôt right or they just didn‚Äôt like the feel/fit so it should be a nice change of experience to be able to try on and feel the clothing before making the purchase. Don‚Äôt underestimate consumer‚Äôs longing for using their senses. Also, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go to the mall!‚Äù might actually be a thing again once this pandemic ends.. shopping is something you can do together socially.

Some specific positive news that can make JWN go higher: 

- Reinstating the dividend (KSS already announced it will do that in 2021 and I imagine JWN will make the same announcement eventually) 

- $ 1,400 stimulus check arriving. This is probably already priced in but maybe it will have a better than expected impact on revenue. 

- Virus numbers getting better, vaccinations numbers eventually getting higher than the number of people infected. Stuff that‚Äôs probably also priced in but I imagine it will be key for department store foot traffic. 

- Less competition. Small retailers will have gone bankrupt (sad but true). Some big peers did too, like Neiman Marcus. In time Nordstrom should thrive on this. 

Earnings (March) could be better than expected. Recently they announced holiday sales numbers which were 22 % less than last year (digital sales saw 23 % growth and accounted for 57 % of total sales). It‚Äôs not bad considering there‚Äôs naturally been way less foot traffic in stores and everyone has been working from home - so why buy new clothes? But Nordstrom successfully sold a lot of athletic and leisure clothing rather than dress wear etc. That‚Äôs the thing, these retailers won‚Äôt just watch and die- they‚Äôre going to adjust their merchandise and inventory to meet customer demands, obviously.

I have a beginner question surrounding capital gains calculation for a particular profit-realization strategy I've been thinking about. If there is a better sub to ask on, please direct me there!


For context, I am asking about US-based capital gains calculations. For the sake of easy math, I will use simple numbers for this scenario.


Let's say I purchase 10 shares of company X's stock for $1/share, a total investment of $10.


Over a short period of time, say a few weeks, company's X's stock price doubles to $2/share. This puts my investment at a value of $20, a 100% return (woo!).


If I were to sell 5 of my 10 shares, for $10, but leave the other 5 shares untouched, and do nothing else for a year, am I right in saying that my capital gains are 0 (net even), since I bought $10 originally, and sold $10 worth?


In this situation, I've gotten my initial investment back, but have ended up with 5 shares of company X remaining. Is it accurate that down the road, whenever I decide to sell those 5 shares, whatever money I get for them is all considered profit, since I already got my initial investment back? e.g. if the shares are valued at $5/share, I sell for $25, therefore capital gains is $25, due to a cost basis of 0 since I already sold enough to get my initial investment back?


My thinking here is that I could essentially get my initial investment back (ideally in a short period of time), don't have any short-term capital gains taxes to pay since no net profit in the first year. Then, after the first year, whatever the shares rise to, it's all profit, and all taxed at the applicable long-term gains rate.


Is this correct? Did I miss something? Let me know in the comments below.


Thanks for reading!


Edit: corrected some math._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice: Covered in Stupidity Hello all

So I own 300 shares of MARA which I got at an average cost of $2.37 a share.  A while back when they stock was in the $6 range, I foolishly decided to sell all 3 covered contracts for a $7 strike price-that expires in 2023!    


So far it hasn't been exercised (how likely is that?).  I was wondering if it would be worth it to buy to close a contract, then sell the one contract I got back weekly, until I can afford to buy the next, ect-The idea being that at some point I'll break even on what I paid to get out of the contracts and then try and sell covered calls at a profit at some point.  Is that even worth it?  Right now, the cost of buying to close one contract would be about $1800.   My initial investment in MARA was a bit over $700._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
