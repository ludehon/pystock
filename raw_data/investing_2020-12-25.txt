 Buying stocks seems like such a mess I come from the cryptocurrency market, on crypto exchanges all the information is available to you, e.g. you can look at the order books for market depth and see the battle between makers and takers and judge liquidity(you can try to scare people off by putting on huge sell walls, or you can put hidden orders), you can see the candlestick formation happening right in front of you, etc etc, all this allows you to have a feeling of what's going on. In contrast with my Interactive Brokers account, it seems as if I have to pay a monthly subscription of hundred dollars just to have "Deep Book" access for one single exchange, like what the fuck. The stock market seems so inefficient, noobish, and perhaps designed in a way to keep the retail investor dumb. It's pretty disappointing.

Is there a way to have access to "Level II" information without having to scam myself?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VIEs and BABA et al There are some common misconceptions about VIEs and the difference between the ADSs listed on US exchanges and the shares on the HK exchanges. I have seen these misconceptions spread here, on Seeking Alpha and also places like Motley Fool. So I have read in detail the SEC filing here [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm)

by Alibaba Group Holding Limited, incorporated in Cayman Islands, for their HK listing and am ready to clarify some of the BS that is being spread.

**THERE IS ZERO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HK AND NYSE SHARES.** A lot of people spread the nonsense that the American ADS's give you "a mere economic ownership of a VIE" whereas the HK listing gives you "direct ownership of the company". They then acted "shocked" that there is almost no difference between the price of the two, and act like this indicated that the market fails to appreciate the VIE risk (I saw this crap being written in a Motley Fool article). This is wrong on so many levels. Here is why:

* **THE SHARES ON THE TWO DIFFERENT LISTINGS ARE FULLY FUNGIBLE.** You can convert each  American ADSs directly to 8 HK shares. The process for doing this is listed here in the SEC [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm#de15203\_conversion\_between\_adss\_and\_ordinary\_shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm#de15203_conversion_between_adss_and_ordinary_shares) Note that this is *completely fucking standard* for ADSs. For example, Tencent (also a VIE) has a listing in HK and also has a very popular ADS available OTC in the US.
* **THE ABOVE FACT MAKES THE TWO SHARES FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT.** The instant there is a meaningful price difference between the American and HK shares, any arbitrageur can buy the cheaper one and sell the more expensive one. How hard is that? Its just a phone call to the broker, and a trivial, approximately $500 fee. In fact, IBKR can convert many shares from ADRs to common stock on foreign exchanges *automatically*, without even a phone call. See [https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=15260#supported-adr](https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=15260#supported-adr)
* **BOTH THE HK SHARES AND US SHARES PROVIDE OWNERSHIP.** More precisely, they both confer ownership in the same company - *Alibaba Group Holding Limited*, incorporated in Cayman Islands. This is a holding company. It has economic interests in China, via contracts with certain VIEs. A VIE must be wholly owned by Chinese citizens.

So, both the HK and US shares are the same thing. Both have the same risks. You can convert from one to the other freely. Both carry a VIE risk, in that these Chinese owned VIEs could theoretically be confiscated by the CCP, depriving the holding company of future income. Also

* **THIS IS THE SAME FOR EVERY CHINESE COMPANY.** China forbids foreigners from owning stock in a Chinese company, so *every single fucking Chinese stock has the exact same VIE risk.* This goes for Tencent, NIO, Netease, Billi etc - under Chinese law, there is no way for a foreigner to do business in China other than through a VIE.

TLDR - there is no difference whatsoever between HK listings and US listings of Chinese stocks. All Chinese stocks carry an identical VIE risk. You can not get around it by owning the HK stock, it literally makes zero difference, its a contract for the exact same thing and is fully fungible with the US one.

**EDIT**: Guys - to clarify, I am not trying to say there is no risk investing in China, or that VIEs don't carry any risk. I am trying to debunk the common conspiracy theory along the lines of "the CCP can, at any time, eliminate the VIE structure and liquidate US investors in BABA, whilst protecting investors in Hong Kong". We are all in the same boat, no matter which exchange we bought the shares in, and the shares are completely interchangeable. If the CCP wipes out investors in BABA, they wipe out holders of 9988. (I also doubt they would destroy the VIE structure entirely, and kill Tencent, NIO, NTES and all the rest. They would be killing the entire HKEX).

 Since Alibaba Holdings is a core holding for Asian mutual funds (I believe I read recently that its the number 1 holding, but I don't feel like searching for the reference today), I personally think the probability of the CCP wiping out all all investors in Alibaba is very small, but that's for you, the individual investor, to decide. (This would also involve wiping out actors like Japan's SoftBank, most of whose NAV is kept in Alibaba Holdings.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your favorite long term stocks?

I had an argument about index funds. My understanding is that index grows because economy grows.

Another idea of other side was that if indexes were profitable then banks would just take cheap loans from central bank and buy index, but they dont do it.

I don't understand selling a stop limit order on Robinhood.

It keeps saying \*High Stop Price\* Your stop price is above the current ask price so your order will likely trigger immediately. Does this mean I'm gonna immediately make my money back?

**Example:**

**Current Stock Price $9**

Let's say that I bought 5 contracts with a strike price of $10 and a premium of $1.6, so that totals $800 that I "invested" in the call options.

Now, I want to sell the 5 contracts back for say.... break even. Then in this case, I would input the following:

**Contracts: 5**

**Limit Price: 1.6 or do I put $160?** \- I should put 1.6 because this is the bid/ask price right?

**Stop Price: what do I put here? 800? 10? 9? -** If I enter 1.6 then I get the High Stop Price Warning

Edit: all the YouTube videos keep giving examples of high values for limit and stop price such as the premium \* 100 instead of just the price of the premium... for example **Limit Price:** $160 instead of $1.6, but I should be entering the ask price before multiplying by 100 for Robinhood right?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you think Boeing is a buy?

Best Regards_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biden's campaign announced a broad plan to invest in clean energy and improve America's infrastructure. Who do you expect to be the winners (or losers) if such a plan is implemented? From his [campaign site](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/):

>Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands.

>Biden will make far-reaching investments in:

>**Infrastructure**: Create millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure – from roads and bridges to green spaces and water systems to electricity grids and universal broadband – to lay a new foundation for sustainable growth, compete in the global economy, withstand the impacts of climate change, and improve public health, including access to clean air and clean water.

>**Auto Industry**: Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century; and invest in U.S. auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union.

>**Transit**: Provide every American city with 100,000 or more residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments with strong labor protections that create good, union jobs and meet the needs of these cities – ranging from light rail networks to improving existing transit and bus lines to installing infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.

>**Power Sector**: Move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.

>**Buildings**: Upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes over 4 years, creating at least 1 million good-paying jobs with a choice to join a union; and also spur the building retrofit and efficient-appliance manufacturing supply chain by funding direct cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows, which will cut residential energy bills.

>**Housing**: Spur the construction of 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units.

>**Innovation**: Drive dramatic cost reductions in critical clean energy technologies, including battery storage, negative emissions technologies, the next generation of building materials, renewable hydrogen, and advanced nuclear – and rapidly commercialize them, ensuring that those new technologies are made in America.

>**Agriculture and Conservation**: Create jobs in climate-smart agriculture, resilience, and conservation, including 250,000 jobs plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines – providing good work with a choice to join or continue membership in a union in hard hit communities, including rural communities, reducing leakage of toxics, and preventing local environmental damage.

>**Environmental Justice**: Ensure that environmental justice is a key consideration in where, how, and with whom we build – creating good, union, middle-class jobs in communities left behind, righting wrongs in communities that bear the brunt of pollution, and lifting up the best ideas from across our great nation – rural, urban, and tribal.

Obviously Biden will have to negotiate this plan with Congress, and it's an open question as to whether Democrats will hold the Senate (which could significantly change what an Infrastructure deal looks like). If we take this plan at face value for the moment, who do you see as some of the likely beneficiaries?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
