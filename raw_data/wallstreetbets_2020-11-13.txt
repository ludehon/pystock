A couple of days ago I purchased a call spread for NIO on Robinhood. I bought a $42c 11/13 contract and sold a $43c 11/13 contract. In total it was $.38 per share.

I figured if NIO closes above $43 I would have a profit of $62 and if NIO closes below $42 I would be out $38.

Since NIO has essentially skyrocketed since, I didn‚Äôt pay much worry. This morning NIO was above $50 but throughout the day it went down. I held onto the contract because I felt there was enough support for it to close above $43.

By 2:45pm NIO went to around $42.50. At 3:00pm today I get a message from robinhood saying they have sold my contract for $.41. Even though I was very confident it would bounce back above $43. At close NIO was above $43 and I feel like I have been cheated out of my $62 profit and instead received $3.

Analysis

a. Active Monthly buyers: 643M in latest Q3 2020 report. PDD‚Äôs buyers are mostly second-tier and lower Chinese cities. Think ‚Äúnight market‚Äù products vs Target/Walmart products.

The active monthly buyers shows nearly 100% penetration among 2nd tier, 3rd tier, and rural areas. Of China‚Äôs 1.4B population, if you subtract out 60+ year olds and <18 year olds, and then subtract out the population of Tier 1 cities, the number is around 700M. PDD is already a ubiquitous brand in its addressable market.

b. PDD became famous for their discounts. "RMB10bn subsidy" is one of its central strategies, where the company gives a subsidy to the seller either directly or through ‚Äúred pocket‚Äù payments to the buyer. This obviously erodes the gross margins, and the CCP's anti-trust regulations coming down forbids this kind of monopolistic behavior.

https://seekin galpha.com/news/3635287-alibaba-tencent-jd-com-among-those-affected-chinas-proposed-antitrust-rules

**Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD):** "Should the rules eventually limit the use of subsidies provided by platforms, we think that the potential limitation will affect Pinduoduo in particular, because 'Rmb10bn subsidy' is one of its central strategies to drive user engagement." Pinduoduo is one of the fast-growing challengers to Alibaba and JD.com.

c. Metrics for the trailing 12 months based on Nov 13, 2020, all numbers by USD. By any measure of Revenue multiple, gross income multiple, or net income multiple, PDD is way more expensive than its competitors.

If anybody has top stock tips for next week which haven't showed up yet on the tape HERE'S your forum to mention and articulate.  Anybody who has followed my last few posts since August has made a freaking killing on solar stock picks playing for a Biden victory.  There's still some solar money to be made if people play the pull backs, while in addition, I encourage people to expand their watch list to also include non-solar renewables.

What's included in this some people might ask?  Right now, I personally am loading up the boat on The Andersons, ticker ANDE.  This is a renewable play on ethanol which under Biden's administration will likely see favorable regulatory policies which will shift demand upward.  From a trading perspective, this stock has a moderately low float and has begun retracing ground lost during the Trump presidency.  If anybody knows other interesting companies in the renewables space I personally would appreciate the information.

If you haven't already figured out the dollar will get annihilated under a Biden presidency here's your forewarning.  The world economy is in the shitter because of COVID and freaking copper amongst every other metal is bid like a brothel auction for a god damn pair of smoking hot 10 twins.  This is it people - we need a bigger fucking boat and need to setup for a reflation trade like no other - this is going to be bigger than 2009; the economy is not starting from scratch the pieces are already in place.

My top gold mining pick, and due to the extreme volatility, this pick is not for the faint of heart  Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, ticker HMY .  If people subscribe to my thesis of the dollar being shredded and are bullish gold this is the stock pick for you.  The company's assets and currency exposure is to the South African Rand which is a rocket on fucking steroids during periods of global reflation and during periods of extreme US Dollar depreciation.  If Gold goes through this year's highs and continues to hold 2200-2300 next year, my price target on this stock will easily be north of $15.

Without further a do happy hunting people, let's get fucking rich, and good luck in the markets.

&#x200B;

JD.com is China‚Äôs largest online retailer and its biggest overall retailer, as well as the country‚Äôs biggest Internet company by revenue. 

If we look back at March, JD only fell 22% during the majors shutdowns and made a very quick comeback. 

Net revenue for Q1 of 2020 was $20.6B That's a 20.7% increase from Q1 of 2019.

Net revenue for Q2 of 2020 was $28.56B. That's a 33.8% increase from Q2 of 2019.

With the holiday season approaching, JD is on track to break well over $100B in revenue this year.

After proving their worth during the major shutdowns/restrictions and repeatedly blasting earnings, I have reason to believe we're sitting on a golden egg.

Check the chart, one year ago JD was at $33.33. Today, JD is at $90.

With major growth, proven resilience, and a solid retail platform, JD will moon to over $100 over the holiday season.

I highly suggest 105c 01/15/2021, 100c 12/24/2020, and 95c 12/11/2020.

If you're looking for quick money buy in by 2PM today. Mondays earnings will bring moderate tendies. If you're looking for a slow but larger growth buy in mid next week as we'll probably see a pull back to current ricing with lower IV.

Activision has something on their hands that has never come across in gaming. They have two titles under a synergistic umbrella in Warzone.

Call of Duty Black Ops came out yesterday night and it‚Äôs getting solid reviews. Regardless of what you think of the game, it has the same old time feel unlike the realistic brother in modern warfare.

It‚Äôs the number 1 game on twitch naturally right now, and it‚Äôs all under the Warzone umbrella.

For those who do not know, Call of Duty‚Äôs Warzone (Battle Royale version) is now allowing both games to access the feature. What once was a cannibalizing hedge, releasing two games at the same time, similar to Apple releasing the same dumb shit every year with Animoji‚Äôs.

Activision can churn two titles and incentivize player usage under the Warzone umbrella. There will be a pay to play feature, new maps, new decals and skins. Everything now will be under one umbrella.

Lastly, Candy Crush, MW mobile, WoW shadowlands are still absolutely crushing it as well. Overwatch 2 is easily coming in 2021. Hearthstone is stupid as fuck but people love it.

Additionally, Blops has Zombs. So go buy it right now. Also, obviously fucking Coronavirus and lockdowns.

Former Wells Fargo & Co. chief executive John Stumpf agreed Friday to pay $2.5 million to settle civil claims over [his role in the bank‚Äôs fake accounts scandal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-wells-fargo-how-far-did-banks-sales-culture-go-1448879643?mod=article_inline), while regulators sued another departed Wells executive over fraud allegations.

https://preview.redd.it/a5yfdw4zj1z51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=e99754c57c450bc8d5884feed1710c1074eadf86

Mr. Stumpf, who [stepped down from his top post in 2016](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-ceo-stumpf-to-retire-1476306019?mod=article_inline), neither admitted nor denied the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs claims, which accused him of misleading investors about the success of Wells Fargo‚Äôs community banking business. Mr. Stumpf was earlier [barred from the banking industry and paid $17.5 million to settle claims](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-agrees-to-pay-sales-misconduct-charges-11579803789?page=1&mod=article_inline) from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. An attorney for Mr. Stumpf declined to comment.

Separately, the SEC sued former consumer-bank head Carrie L. Tolstedt, filing a civil fraud case against her in San Francisco federal court. The regulators said Ms. Tolstedt publicly [described and endorsed a key measure ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/carrie-tolstedt-in-the-eye-of-the-wells-fargo-storm-1474326652?mod=article_inline)of Wells Fargo‚Äôs business, [the ‚Äúcross-sell metric‚Äù](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-wells-fargo-cross-selling-mess-means-for-banks-1473965166?mod=article_inline)‚Äîor the number of products the bank sold to its customers‚Äîwithout disclosing that it was inflated by unused and unauthorized accounts and services.

The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit seeks a court judgment ordering Ms. Tolstedt to pay fines and barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The OCC, another of the bank‚Äôs regulators, separately charged Ms. Tolstedt earlier this year, seeking $25 million and a lifetime ban from the banking industry.

Enu Mainigi, an attorney for Ms. Tolstedt, said the former Wells executive acted appropriately and would fight to clear her name.

‚ÄúIt is unfair and unfounded for the SEC to point the finger at Ms. Tolstedt when her statements were not only true but also thoroughly vetted by others as part of Wells Fargo‚Äôs policies, procedures and systems of controls,‚Äù Ms. Mainigi said. 

The nation‚Äôs fourth-largest bank and its former executives have been under regulatory scrutiny since its fake-accounts scandal came to light more than four years ago. The bank has been hit with billions of dollars in fines. Executives have paid penalties and [had compensation clawed back](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-claws-back-75-million-more-from-john-stumpf-and-former-retail-bank-head-1491823808?mod=article_inline). The scandal badly tarnished the bank‚Äôs reputation and weighed on its financial performance.

For years before the scandal became public, the bank said that a key to its success was its ability to sell many accounts and other products to its customers. The SEC said that Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Tolstedt approved disclosures to investors that included inflated or misleading figures because many of the accounts were unauthorized or unused. Mr. Stumpf ‚Äúlearned of facts that put, or should have put, him on notice‚Äù about inaccuracies related to the cross-selling metric from 2015 to 2016, the SEC said in a settlement order. Ms. Tolstedt also touted these numbers when speaking publicly to investors, the SEC said.

At the same time, many inside the company were allegedly raising alarms about the company‚Äôs reliance on cross-selling. One banker who resigned in 2014 told Ms. Tolstedt: ‚ÄúI have spent a majority of my time here at Wells Fargo closing accounts for customers‚Äù who didn‚Äôt need or use them, according to the SEC‚Äôs complaint.

‚ÄúIf executives speak about a key performance metric to promote their business, they must do so fully and accurately,‚Äù said Stephanie Avakian, director of the SEC‚Äôs enforcement division. ‚ÄúThe commission will continue to hold responsible not only the senior executives who make false and misleading statements but also those who certify to the accuracy of misleading statements despite warnings to the contrary.‚Äù

The current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

In terms of comparable valuation, Alibaba is undervalued against the market.

DCF-based BABA stock price target suggests 100% upside potential.

#1 Price vs. Growth
Let's start with some purely technical parameters.

Starting from mid-2015, Alibaba's (BABA) stock price has been following, with varied success, its long-term exponential trend that acts as a smart average. Now, the company's current share price is synchronized with this trend, but until recently it has significantly outperformed it.

At the same time, looking at the rolling annual total price return, we can say that in the last few months, the rise in the price of Alibaba's stock has been excessive. And therefore, the observed correction is, in principle, natural.

Moving onto more fundamental parameters.

Over the past two quarters of the fiscal year 2021, the average expectations of analysts regarding the growth of BABA's revenue and EPS in the current and next fiscal year tend to increase. 

And here, it is pertinent to recall that more than 90% of the revenue Alibaba receives is in the domestic market.

In turn, China is the only large country in the world whose economy is growing during the coronavirus epidemic. Source: OECD

And there is virtually no coronavirus problem in China. 

In short, the company's external business environment looks optimistic.

Moving onto Alibaba's valuation. 

The long-term relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size is linear. Formally, this reflects investor confidence in the stability of the company's future growth rates.

By the way, this relationship identifies Alibaba's current capitalization as balanced. But, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q1 '22 FY, BABA's revenue TTM will be around $13 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational capitalization will come close to $900 billion.

The second one is the relationship between Alibaba's capitalization and the FCF TTM absolute size. In this case, the company's current price is balanced too:

In the context of the above, I believe that the current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

#2 Comparable Valuation
I single out two multiples, which makes it possible to compare Alibaba with the market. Both multiples are forward and both are adjusted for the growth rate of the basic indicators (I used a four-year CAGR).

Judging by the Forward P/S (next FY) multiple, Alibaba is undervalued now.

A comparative valuation of BABA through the Forward P/E (next FY) multiple also indicates that the company is undervalued.

In terms of comparable valuation, I believe Alibaba is undervalued against the market right now.

#3 DCF Valuation
To forecast the company's revenue for the next decade, I used a polynomial model that most closely matches the current average estimates of analysts. I believe that such approach is the least subjective.

To calculate the weighted average cost of capital, I used the current yield of China 10-Year Bond as a risk-free rate for the Chinese market (3.28%), equity risk premium (6.26%), and 3-year rolling beta coefficient (0.71). To calculate the cost of debt, I used the interest expense for 2019 and 2020 FY divided by the debt value for the same years.

When building the model, I used the following key assumptions:

In the next decade, Alibaba's operating margin will decline from the current 18% to 15% in a terminal year.

The relative size of CAPEX will be on average over the past six years.

The average tax rate will amount to 25%.

The DCF-based target price of Alibaba's shares is $541, offering 101% upside.

Bottom Line

In fact, China's economy is now the only one capable of showing growth. At the same time, the online shopping industry in China is booming due to fear of the pandemic. These are two powerful and undisputed growth drivers for Alibaba.

Chinese stock exchanges reacted mostly positively to the likely election of Biden as president of the United States. Although it is too early to draw conclusions, judging by the general tone in the media, it is expected that bilateral policy will become more predictable. At the very least, this reduces the risks for BABA.

Fundamentally, BABA is undervalued. It is obvious. And time will fix it.

I've been holding cash since my last winning play on November 2nd. Decided to enter a new position today, probably sometime this afternoon as VIX gradually settles down. Here are my thoughts for the near-term and some advice on how to play this wild market.

We all knew there would be another vaccine news bump in the markets. That bump hit, but it fizzled quickly. We aren't out of the woods on Covid yet, not by a long shot. The vaccine still won't be available for many months, and cases are still quickly rising. Nothing we didn't already know on that front...

The important point here is that vaccine news has had time to soak in and is now priced into the markets. The vaccine bump was a short-term peak that closed out the upward channel SPY has been following the past several days. Things are flattening out and we are now in a consolidation pattern, with buyers and sellers battling within a range of price consolidation. Looks like support roughly around 351 and resistance around 357 for SPY.

The way Covid will impact retail sales around the Black Friday / Christmas period is definitely an interesting question. I highly doubt we will see the old widely publicized black friday hysteria. We may even see news reports showing emptied out shopping malls and such for contrast to previous years, which will hurt consumer and business sentiment. But that is simply speculation on my part. The more important factors are the long-term indicators.

The Powell-induced euphoria pumped the markets up over the past several months to strongly over-priced levels, using any metric you wish. I'm still a fan of the Detrended Buffett Indicator, and even with the projected rise in GDP the market is still strongly overvalued. Every buyer is fighting against this inherent downward pressure, and it can not last forever.

https://preview.redd.it/aby9l49f41z51.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f5af19ca3b141283dc85321a6176f915519744c

At some point this market is going to unwind, and hard. The only impossible thing to know is when. So here is my basic strategy in this market, in a nutshell:

**My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**

I'm getting those bearish tingles again, so will be entering a conservative options position starting today.

The VXX was down roughly 5% today and is near it's post-Covid low point, which again makes it a good opportunity to buy, so I will be adding VXX calls to my SPY puts. I'll be making a fairly short-term position with just enough wiggle room to hold if things start to unwind again in the coming weeks.

We are likely to get a preliminary readout from MRNA in the past few days, and because it works similarly to the Pfizer vaccine, and that should cause more moon to LYV. Plus a bajillion other possible positive vaccine data on the horizon can cause many more moon.

People are dying to go to concerts. In the Spanish Flu pandemic, the era called the roaring 20's was actually a reaction to the bleak period. As Nicholas Christakis (known for getting yelled at by insane liberals on Yale campus for saying people should wear whatever Halloween costume they want) wrote in WSJ:

"If the Roaring Twenties following the 1918 pandemic are a guide, the increased religiosity and abstemiousness of the immediate and intermediate periods could give way to increased expressions of risk-taking, intemperance and joie de vivre in the post-pandemic period. People will relentlessly seek opportunities for social mixing on a larger scale at sporting events, concerts and political rallies."

Sporting events and concerts, the bread and butter of LYV's business ladies and gentleman. Easiest trade in the world. Because I'm trying to leverage off the MRNA positive readout thats probably coming next week, I've done short dated calls. But any length of calls in the next few years seems great. It doesn't matter that there won't be concerts until next year, when it's obvious there business will come roaring back this thing will moon.

Earnings 11/23 Yes, NIU, not NIO. Can't believe I am not hearing more about this one. Chinese EV scooter play that is rapidly expanding throughout Europe and the rest of Asia. Market cap of just over $2.5 Billion and loads of room to grow. It has been a volatile one the last few weeks but it has quietly had a 20% week and volume starting to really pick up (compared to average volume that is). Also just busted through double top resistance at $32. Six month chart looks great and analyst upgrades and price target increases have been coming left and right. Earnings on 11/23 and they are predicted to be pretty solid. I expect the run-up to continue to earnings and then a possible skyrocket from there in the next few months once more people start to catch on. Seen only one post discussing this one in the last few weeks, so really a sleeper flying under the current EV radar in my opinion. Option volume is also starting to pickup big time in the last few weeks.

Are you interested in publicly showcasing how special you are? Yes?

Then I have EV car and the stock for you.

**What is Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corp [SOLO]**

Have you heard the phrase, [a picture is worth a thousand words?](https://electrameccanica.com)

They make three-wheeled electric passenger vehicle. That‚Äôs right. Three-wheeled. Two wheels in the front and one in the back.

This is a car for special kind of degenerates.

**Well, so the car looks retarded. But the stock‚Äôs going up. Why shouldn‚Äôt I go all in?**

Well my child. It‚Äôs going up because retards like you probably didn‚Äôt even research this company. You probably didn‚Äôt even know that their car is three wheeled. You just heard that it‚Äôs a Canadian EV play and because all the EV stocks are going up, you were looking for some cheap stock that looked cheap and jumped right in.

The company just posted $0.19 per share PRO-FORMA profit (vs, analyst expectation of $0.11 per share loss). What is pro-forma profit? Pro-forma profit comes from financial statement that has hypothetical amounts or estimates built into the data to give a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of a company‚Äôs profits. 

What? You don‚Äôt understand? It means that shit is made up. Means that it‚Äôs structured in a way to only show what the management wants you to see, adding and excluding various items based on what the management wants you to see.

They will tell you that they use pro-Forma earnings to give investors a clearer view of their operations and because of that, they exclude unique expenses and charges. The problem, is that there are no rules. The company can just do anything to come up with pro-Forma numbers. It‚Äôs meant to show positive numbers to exclude things like stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs and other expenses that will result a loss.

Under US GAAP rules, they lost 14.9 million CAD, which is 3 times the loss YOY

**So what‚Äôs the play?**

Well, the market is hot for Chinese EV stocks right now but the halo effect will die down once the earnings season dies out. Along with that, this shitty ass stock will drop back down because they report fake ass profit and they make shitty ass three wheeled cars for numb-nuts.

$5p with Dec 18 2020 expiration is going for about $1 per contract. Short this shitty ass stock. It‚Äôs going to go back down to $2-$3 range once the retards in this sub sees the pictures of the cars and understand the fake ass profit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where are all the PLTR gain/loss posts?

PLTR 18 CCL 
PLTR 17 CCL_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Leveraged Stocks Continue to Make Money (Up +65K) Fellas,

If you've been constantly losing money these few months, this post aims to save you.

Last you heard of me, I recommended a well-diversified global value stock portfolio, leveraged to the optimal ratio as the most efficient and consistent way to make money:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa\_leverage\_margin\_and\_proper\_diversification/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/)

Since then, I'm up another $65K (+51% annualized return). I made so much money, I had to re-borrow back up to 2:1 leverage. Forget your FDs, 0DTE and hopeless OTM options. Opt for a high-risk but theoretically-optimal portfolio that actually makes money.

I short the SPX box as a way to access even lower borrowing rates (I pay \~0.4% on roughly $440K of borrowed money). The rest is a well-diversified value global portfolio with low-cost smart-beta ETFs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I knew y‚Äôall were retarded didn‚Äôt know yall were dyslexic too _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ üåàüêª _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I am no hater, but just to share: Citron Pulls the Plug on NIO, Price Target $25 [https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NIO-Citron-Pulls-the-Plug.pdf](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NIO-Citron-Pulls-the-Plug.pdf)

"Anyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen. "

I mean, if buying 3 letters makes you money, there is no reason not to. Although you are also buying risk when it goes down. So, happy playing!

You are welcome. I have no position on $NIO.

Edit: 50% downvote wow, thank you WSB. For the record, I agree with Citron here, although I am not short because I am a coward. If you look at XPeng and Li's earnings, which are the main catalyst that drove these stocks 50+% higher this week. Yes their revenue beat, but their net profit are much worse than the estimate. Translation: they are selling the cars cheaper, losing more money in order to attract customers. And this is exactly Citron's point. Their profitability is a huge concern._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gaming company - Razer INC. (Ticker RAZFF) Took a look at Razer's investor relations page: [https://investor.razer.com/html/index.php](https://investor.razer.com/html/index.php)

After that I researched a bit more away from their website and it seems like Razer is a very solid company with a lot of cash and no debts to be paid.

&#x200B;

Their new line of products is well received by creators all over the internet and their fanbase is building a lot of hype around it. They also have a strong online presence (3.3M followers on Twitter and 1.75M on Youtube) that actively interacts with their posts.

&#x200B;

Holidays are coming up and I think A LOT of Razer products will be underneath the Christmas tree.

Their products are targeted to a younger audience  which are really into gaming right now and their existing customerbase keeps buying their peripherals as they grow older.

&#x200B;

The share is trading at around $0.30 right now which is a bargain imo and it also means you don't need a lot of cash to take a small position in this company.

&#x200B;

Don't see a lot of negatives around this stock. Will probably take a decent position into Razer. Thoughts?

Another Chinese EV stock that just beat earnings? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO is a Bull Trap I'm bullish rn on most of the market, but NIO is a bull trap. Up 122% in the last month, 28%+ in the last two days and earnings are next week. There is no way this doesn't pull back like the kangaroo it is, even if earnings are good. 

Long term NIO is a smart move though. My advice?

1. Don't FOMO, wait for the pullback.

2. Sell 50-75% of your calls soon, before noon if not 10:30.

3. Buy puts for next week. IV is high but this is a casino so who cares?

4. Buy in after the pull back next week w/ shares/leaps.

5. Profit!

as you know we had a yuge vaccine pump monday, which faded very quickly (so quick like nobody have ever seen before). this pump was about pfizer vaccine. which is completely irrelevant. because, the king of market manipulation with vaccine news is fucking moderna.

if you remember from april or may (i guess), even monkey studies of moderna vaccine pumped market yugely. i guess thats because its ceo is a corrupt piece of shit and a close friend of trump.

whatever, moderna has enough data and [started interim analysis](https://investors.modernatx.com/node/10296/pdf) this wednesday. fauci previously stated moderna vaccine would have [similar efficacy with pfizer vaccine](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1326563908652429313) and they would [share the results soon](https://twitter.com/FirstSquawk/status/1326588714382839809). fauci is mostly known for his bearish comments, but the guy is a straight arrow. i don't doubt his comments.

yesterday dix spiked yugely. suddenly, nutting activity in dark markets went tits up, like it never did before. [here is the graph.](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix) this simply means some jerks out there knows something we wsb retards don't know.

AND

so listen up there will be yuge pump when they disclose the results, i assume it will be today as trump will also meet with the ceo. maybe he will pump it himself. nobody knows. maybe it can pump monday. but whatever.

Another day, another GME post.

Power move or dumbass move selling consoles in store on black Friday? I think they are the only retailer to physically sell next gen consoles in store. Also, I think they're only selling bundles in store, driving up their margins/rev per console sold initially. Smart move as every gaming website/blog is talking about GameStop instead of Amazon/Best Buy because of this - but in terms of optics not sure how people will take it with the pandemic getting worse. I'm sure there will be pictures of lines on social media today.

Anyone have any calculations on estimated FCF and gross on the next gen console life cycle for GME?

PS4/XBONE sold \~ 115m and 50m respectively according to wikipedia over their cycle. If PS5/XBX sell 10-20% more units this cycle, that's around 20-35m units for Gamestop over the next few years ( plus bundles / attachments / trade ins / financing / etc ).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kvhsawwd7yy51.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=046e00a0fdfa506c59f944efe4498820698f6b0b

Short term, Sony said they expect to sell 7.6m PS5s by March 2021, so at least 1-2m can be expected to be sold by GME in the next 3-4 months. Not sure about Xbox estimates. \~49% of games sold are still physical, with the total gamer base increasing, the effect on decreasing physical sales isn't as dramatic. Further, parents/grandparents and others who buy games as gifts/presents (big driver of gaming sales) prefer to buy physical gifts.

I'm definitely over-simplifying here (console sales numbers are global, bulk of GME sales are in the US so the % share of sales will be lower than above), but the premise still stands and I think they have a great opportunity to turn profitable by the end of the year.

Oh and this is totally ignoring Switch sales, and all the other things that GME sells, including PC hardware and components. I don't believe the prophetic short squeeze will happen, but I do think the stock will moon soon based on the business itself once the company shakes off its 'in financial distress' reputation amongst investors.

Now that the bankruptcy thesis is pretty much dead in the water with management voluntarily retiring 60% of their debt using cash flow from operations, what will the next big catalyst will be? Clearly this is a huge signal to the market that the business is healthy, and management is bullish on FCF and sales targets for the next few quarters/years.

GME GME GME GME GME GME_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO and a small stock named SOLO...just found out about it. Whatcha y'all think about SOLO that ride with Chinese EVs _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp Listen up you degenerates.

If you‚Äôve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO üöÄ, or you were simply üåà üêª, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company‚Äôs products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald‚Äôs and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there‚Äôs unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don‚Äôt stop and ask, ‚ÄúMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?‚Äù Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can‚Äôt understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for ‚Äúdonations‚Äù. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR‚Äôs total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Est√©e Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company‚Äôs CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company‚Äôs gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with üåà üêª LED lights around the case? Those ü§° s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, ‚ÄúPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?‚Äù. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can‚Äôt afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech‚Äôs POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it‚Äôs never your fault. It‚Äôs the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR‚Äôs products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock‚Äôs valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80.
