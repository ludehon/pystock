 Wow super bowl commercial for us _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Earnings this week with High Short Squeeze Potential (Week of 2/8) Hello All,

Late on my dedicated time of 1pm EST, but here are the earnings this week with high short interest and days to cover. Just to clarify some of this, in order to make the list, they must meet both of these conditions: they must have a short interest above 5%, and ALSO must have a "Days to Cover" (DTC) greater than 3. DTC is calculated by taking the shares short divided by the average 10 day volume. While this isn't necessarily a proper indication, it does show the short amount relative to average trading volume. Without further delay, here is the list for this week:

Edit: there seems to be some confusion, as expected when dealing with fellow crayon eaters. This is a list of companies with a higher potential for short squeeze this week due to 1) high short interest, 2) lower volume relative to amount of shares sold short, 3) a catalyst (earnings) this week that could bring in other retail and institutional investors. Yes, I know (insert stock) has 40%+ Short Interest and isn't on my list of "low short interest shit", great, they don't report earnings this week, they're not going to be on it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why RITE AID is (RAD) not BAD Hello :-)

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to **TWENTY FOUR** billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

20x 34.5 2/19 c is my immediate play

Edit: my position is 24.5 c I am as they say retarded_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some AMC “DD” for the average 🦍 I’ve seen a few people finally bring up AMC as something more than GME’s honorable mention. I’m just a casual trader who was holding 1k of AMC and some option contracts before this clown fiesta of a market trend showed up. I’ve done a fair amount of “DD” on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don’t expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that’s pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.

Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don’t believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it’s much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren’t expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.

This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically: 

Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv.
Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn’t make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios. [Here’s the article ](https://qz.com/1885992/universals-deal-with-amc-is-huge-for-the-movie-industry/)
This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn’t show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.

Next, I should talk about how AMC’s stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock’s value. 
[Here’s another arrival on that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/amp/) 
Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That’s not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023. 

I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC’s future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren’t I’m sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.

TLDR, 
1) Block buster movie budgets are $100’s of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit.
2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix.
3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future. 
   
Still hold GME, AMC, and BB 💎🙌. Since they told me in college diversification is smart, and I’m a high functioning autistic 🦍.

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.

However, with all the vaccinations going on, and Biden winning the presidency, soon Covid will be a thing of the past:

What this means is $KO will soon be swimming in money again. If you're quick you can get in before the smart money picks up on these obscure clues.

Now I'm not too good with numbers and stats (who needs it anyway, stonks go up), so instead, to show the potential $KO has let me direct you to the daily graph since 2020:

Before it was TSLA, AMD, weed stocks and we always had extremely bullish retards writing long ass DD to justify their rationale. We also had bearish bears writing theories like quadwitching where we collectively lost money. But even when at peak Tesla, we still had posts about small pee pee AAPL gains, and loss porn because of the Mouse 🐁

I also threw money like y'all in GME and didn't close while ahead. I'm going to diamond hand this because frankly I don't have an exit strategy and with options, I somewhat broke even for stocks i bought. Now we can keep crying about money lost or try to make new money. There are lot of plays going on. What happened to my PLTR gang? Why are y'all so silent? Weed stocks are going up again, yet we ain't paying attention. BYND been shooting again, crossing some important levels. TSLA back to 850+. We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop. 

So i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out? We can circle jerk all day and cry about those hedge funds and the media and the manipulation like we've been doing for past two weeks. Or we can start looking for new plays and buy new consoles from GameStop. At least that's a better plan than just simply hoping to pump questionable DD posts to r/all and expecting momentum swing.

induldge me for a second as I stray a little from the hottest topics of this sub. I’m very interested in the $30B sextech industry for many reasons (people getting back together this summer, women’s empowerment, etc.) and know that many companies that fall in this category never get looks from institutional investors and are pretty beholden to crowdfunding and VCs.

I’m just your humble ape-retail investor, so my fanciest source for finding opportunities are usually common sources (SA, Google, etc.).  None of my queries have turned-up a sextech ETF.

Also don't claim losses until you sell your shares. In most countries you generally only pay the taxes on your earnings when you sell your shares. Probably all countries but I don't want to be definitive 

Likewise, you can only claim losses on your shares when you sell them. You cannot claim a deduction for unrealised losses

Lastly, it is illegal to sell your shares to realise the losses so you can claim a tax deduction and immediately buy shares back (it's called a wash trade). Don't do this either.

I've seen some stupid comments around here about people using their entire earnings to pay their loans or others claiming tax deductions on losses for shares they still own

Check your countries individual tax laws before spending any money or making any deductions. Calculate your tax obligations before spending a cent. If you can't, either get an accountant to do it or just wait to find out how much you owe. If you thought the stress of holding was bad, wait until you get audited._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ bought some $GME after hours because i’m retarded...one positive PR from management is all we need to trigger the inevitable short covering..388 @$65.56 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $OPEN - MASSIVE SETUP This is my last post on OPEN. This opportunity is significant imo. Technically this is setting up very well.

We traded down last week on an equity raise that was oversubscribed and upsized.

Quiet period is likely ending (not sure if this happens with SPACs), so you could see initiation reports from the big sell-side banks over the coming weeks.

Fundamentals of the business are strong with U.S. home prices + sales rising. Targeting $36-40 in the next two weeks and $60 after earnings.

\*Certainly not financial advice, looking for insight from the less smooth-brained - holding a handful of shares and ATM calls for Feb through Jan 22\*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $VSTO DD- A great value play (Vista Outdoors) **TLDR: Ammo sales/backorders are currently the highest they have ever been, and the market has not reacted yet**

Let me start by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. However, I am a “gun guy” and regularly shoot a lot (~20,000 rounds a year) and compete in shooting sports (USPSA, 3 gun, Steel Challenge, etc). I hold 100 shares of VSTO as well as 10x Feb 19 $35c and 2x Jun 19 $35c. I plan to buy more shares on any dips below $30, and I will explain why.


Some background:
In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington’s ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won’t return to “normal” (i.e. you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).


The fundamentals:
First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):

Price to sales: 0.86x (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that’s insane in a cyclical industry)
Price to book: 2.43x
Price to cash flow: 4.64x
And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is 33.59x. This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).


Looking forward:
Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of 13.5x!!
For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx.. 0.60 cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)


Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this.
Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo


Risks:
Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand

Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)

These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can’t figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, February 08, 2021 Your daily trading discussion thread.

Buying calls for the run up is the play here. Their price normally peaks the week before earnings so 2/19 expiry is probably better since it’s cheaper will offer higher returns. 

Don’t be so fixated on one or two tickers that you miss out on other opportunities. I’ve made money on Pypl earnings and SNE recently.

Why is this of note? 

Chinese capital firm Keybanc reported last month that Tencent is raising large amounts of money for a purchase, with Zynga being among the possible targets.

Blackrock and Tencent are already working together on ways for Tencent to gain more market share in China.

https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blackrock-in-talks-with-internet-giant-tencent-over-china-tie-up-20191003

So, why does the 5% matter? 

If you own a single share in a stock, you can have voting rights when it comes to major decisions the company makes. The more shares you have, the more your vote counts. If you own more than 5%, you get special voting rights and a 5% or more share-ownership signifies that the owner intends to be an active participant in the stock, rather than a passive one.

In addition, dark pools have been active on Zynga for months now with large purchases coming in almost daily. For those who don't know about dark pools, this is a quick primer:
 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp?

I'm thinking Blackrock wants to make sure it gets a say in any decision regarding Zynga and they've been doing it as quietly as possible.

Zynga stock also just happens to have broken above its high of [NINE YEARS.](https://imgur.com/a/6tPWzF1)

Earnings are this Wednesday, Feb 10, after the bell, and it also presents at two conferences on Feb 11th and March 3. 

Zynga is a sleeper, but it won't be for long.

At some point in the future if this sub is ever to continue in its previous form,  we will need to restrict the GME posts to a daily super thread.  Most likely this stock will make a painful downward spiral back to sub 20 and the bag holders will become more and more desperate to get one more pump, which will lead to more and more sad and desperate posts.  


Yes I know,  I'm a hedge fund shill trying to steal your 40 shares....._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Starting 2022 movie theaters, such as AMC, will be able to own streaming services and streaming services such as Netflix will be able to own theaters. Paramount vs United States was an anti-trust decree that prohibited movie theaters from producing their own movies or production companies from owning movie theaters. The court granted the DOJ's motion to lift the decrees on August 7, 2020, starting a two-year sunset termination period of the decrees. This might be good news for struggling movie theaters such as AMC, as they can now be acquired by Amazon or Netflix without violating any anti-trust laws.

Discovery holds a bunch of networks women love to watch, like HG TV, Food Network, house flipping and all that. Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.

Among all free apps in Apple universe, it has been moving between 50th and 100th place for the past couple weeks in downloads, and have been on top 10 rankings for android for a while. 

Trading at a 20 P/E and 7x FCF compared to its competitors you could say its relatively cheap. 

Now here are the catalysts, Michael Bury owns 500k shares of this beauty. I'm sure he did more DD than me, so betting on big fella to find value for me. 
It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount.
Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.

As you all are aware, growth expectation is everything in this market. Down is up, up is up, everything makes money.

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you to buy the stonk, I just like the stonk myself. Couldnt care less what y'all decide to do. 

As of the day of this post I’m long 1/2022 $60 and $70 calls, also $47.5 3/19/2021 calls and planning to hold until mid year at least.

Godspeed_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC GOOD LONG TERM? (Buy/Hold) Edit: I am aware of the possible squeeze incoming and am already in possession of 7 amc @3.43 I just really UNIRONICALLY like the stock

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think "wow this is a rip", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means "popular" or "accessible".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a "make-it-or-break-it" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY FALLACIES, LOGICAL ERRORS, OR ANY OUTSTANDING MISTAKES THIS IS MY FIRST DD AND I WANT BECOME A MORE ACTIVE USER. I AM HERE TO LEARN AND MAKE A LITTLE MONEY, AND ANY ADVICE YOU GIVE IS MUCH APPRECIATED_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The sub is divided and you're creating a cult. Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.

I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like "short squeeze," "counterfeit shares," learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming "MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN." COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying "you're an idiot." or "you should have sold like I did retard" you're only making the problem worse.

If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.

Tl;dr: pleas wsb again_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market inefficiencies, MOASS and you. A discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us. So the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market. A basket of WAY over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market, Rh fucked 80% of the sub, and now there is going to be Congressional and regulatory inquiries. So instead of yet another gme go brrrr post, I would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is. 

There is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this. What that looks like we don't know yet. But because the PDT rule exists I am pretty sure of that. Ironically the rule that is "meant to protect" retail definitely cost me more money when I was starting, by trying to avoid strikes, then any crazy yolo's. 

That brings us to the first point to consider. Retail options trading. I am willing to bet large sums of money they're going to come after it. And while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading, do we really have the effect that they will claim we have? Sure it can swing smaller stocks, but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys. Remember how  short lived that was on MSFT? Mass amounts of capital that we couldn't possibly bring to market are needed for that. Softbank did it though, and that was a big dick move, especially because they are Asian and not known for packing schmeat. 

The next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market. HF leverage. They were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history. 

&#x200B;

[Seriously, this is how bad it was](https://preview.redd.it/34s2v7k2v3g61.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=950655debb8e699323d73684a0137961bf8e3152)

&#x200B;

It might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk. But the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits. This being wsb, I respect that. But it was not retail that over-levered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close. 

The market did not actually crash this time though, and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now. 

&#x200B;

[Baby dip but decent potential for upside.](https://preview.redd.it/rw516tcjw3g61.jpg?width=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a41cd6f24cf76a7fa5d7c3ccd8005ae8dc9c9a25)

Maybe, just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the HF's and IB's are using? These types of events are happening more often than in the past. The bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this. Maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years ( dot com, 2008, Volmageddon, covid crash, and now this).

I pretty much wrote this whole thing because I would really like to see some intelligent discussion here again, and I am curious to see how fucked others think retail trading as a whole is when the suits do finally get together to discuss this.

Everyone is a genius during a bull market. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝

Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

Edit 4 - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)

Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract). Heavy institutional ownership including BAE Cathie Wood. 30% Short Float to be squeezed on contract announcement._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I heard you fellas like 3D printed diamond hands, so I painted mine. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I didn't make any money on GME, but I did make this _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Beatles knew it all before Diamond hands forever 💎✋

The specific part of the discussion I’ll highlight is *whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood*. Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD: 

*the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC* 

Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the “177% float” we’re not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts—a no-brainer, if you will. The success of the $GME squeeze scared the funds into avoiding a part 2 at all costs, $AMC surpassing ~$30 and staying there would be in direct contrast to so. many. short. positions. Now, I’m sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn’t even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline—when theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I’m inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.

Tell me if I’m wrong through, tell me I’m missing something. Tell me that $6.00 isn’t a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a... *thrilling*... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I’ll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards?

ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I’m not a professional, I’m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy’s.

**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.

**Summary**

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
* The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.

**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share. 

This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial/mortgage sector*. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups. 

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it. 

**Key Point - Catalysts**

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

**The Business**

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

*Home Financing*

* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop. 
* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world. 
* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
* Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.

*Home Sale and Search*

* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.

*Auto & Personal Financing*

* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.

*Media*

* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.

*Services & Technology Development*

* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
* Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.

**Recent Acquisitions**

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

**Management**

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

**Financials and Growth**

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth. 

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected. 

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion. 

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

[https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)

**I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

**Product Channels**

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)

The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

**Current Market and outlook**

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

In the same article the journalist writes " Robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading".

In the attached image I computed a comparison between NIO (which according some brokers was one of the most traded stocks recently) and GME volumes among the period that goes from the 02/Jan/20 to the 05/Feb/21.

It is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for GME are not even remotley close to the spikes in NIO. On the period I considered the maximun daily volume for GME, which occures on the 22/Jan/21, is just the 45% of the NIO's maximum daily volume of 577,185,100.

Also, considerind the maximum 3-day rolling sum of volumes GME is just the 41% of the NIO's above 1 bln exchanged shares.

Computing percentage variations as LN(volumes\_d/volumes\_d-1) GME shows the maximum peak on 314% but above NIO of only 43% and not even in the hottest days of January 2021, but  around October 2021.

Is it true that RH had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in GME?

With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.

At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of 14.05% per annum.

From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.

I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.

[http://www.usacompression.com/](http://www.usacompression.com/)

TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable 14.05% yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.

Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: "15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)"**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a "short ladder attack", "ladder attack", or "short attack" fall into this. "Short ladder attacks" and "ladder attacks" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's "research" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say "short attack" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a "short ladder attack" or "ladder attack" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: "GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze"**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: "Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not."**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: "https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/"**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the "CounterfeitingStock" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: "How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding"**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: "GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers."**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that "177% of float held" means the same as "177% short interest". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here:

**Number 7: "S3 Partner's "S3 SI% of Float" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why"**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: "It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers"**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs "caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that "greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales."








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

If investors are pulling out of one of the most successful hedge funds of all time, which had annualized returns of 60% for decades, what are they doing with their funds at other funds? Where are they going to put their money? 

Is this a sign that money is being moved out equities entirely by institutional and other investors? Or was Renaissance uniquely impacted by the Coronavirus crash, which they say caused their worst ever year in 2020? 

Renaissance is perhaps the most celebrated hedge fund of all time and its annualized returns are practically unbelievable. It's hard not to interpret a nearly 5% loss in AUM as a bad sign for equities.

Must be a short step ladder attack or something._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Small potatoes compared to some, but still holding onto this ride. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype. 

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an "I told you so".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a "short ladder attack" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

I was trying to find up to date Short Interest values for all of the recent 'reddit/wsb/meme stocks', as CNBC and others like to call them.

I just wanted to share what I have found and I hope the information is valid. I'm not looking to persuade anyone any one way. I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Did I miss anything? I'm an ape. Moon. Rocket. Diamond Hands.

So I came across the FINRA 2021 Short Interest Reporting Dates, found here: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

https://preview.redd.it/1i4w7vwx53g61.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbad7d29a9e679f0c7cdb95d7ecbcb48470062ae

"FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. All short interest positions must be reported by 6 p.m. Eastern Time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA." On January 27th, trading became restricted by a few brokers for GME and other stocks. On January 28th, RH restricted trades for the entire trading session, and many days after. However, on January 29th, firms had to report their short positions. This information will become public on Tuesday, Feb 9th. I'm not sure what time this will happen. Also, I'm not sure what the position will show from the January 29 reports. Were the positions recorded at different times from different firms? Were they recorded at closing hours? 6pm as well? Hard to tell.

Regardless, what I see as important here, is that at some point Tuesday Feb. 9th, we will have an updated Short Interest value. Until then, I wouldn't trust any sites values. i.e Finviz, which has shown the same 121% short float % for the past 2 weeks? Because I assume they too are awaiting the reports from FINRA. Does Bloomberg Terminal have access to this information somehow? After all, this data was reported on Feb. 2nd. So the information is out there somewhere.

I started a free-trial on: [https://www.ortex.com/](https://www.ortex.com/) and from a report on there, I found the short interest values that were reported on Dec. 31, 2020 and Jan. 15, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/xz08amp573g61.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=38fd7c8c3fca875c14f7a2586b3462342feafd06

I have no idea what the short position will hold for Jan. 29th. I also have no idea how to interpret the Days to cover column. If anyone can provide anymore information I will update this post.

**tl/dr:** Short Interest Values should be updated on Tuesday, February 9th. Not sure what time. We'll know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then, if it hasn't happened before then.

Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.” 

**Q4 ER**

They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. 

From the ER press release:

" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents."

They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!

**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**

Again, from the horse's mouth:

"Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**."

So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.

**Who are their customers**

Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

**Catalysts**

Do you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.

**Value**

 HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.

Yeah, there's still room.

**Positions**

5,000 shares

100 03/19 $7 calls

**TLDR:**

HIMAX has given great guidance for 2021. Stock is undervalued already. This company will continue its rocket powered flight.

And you know what got a large percentage of the attention for seemingly no reason? No DD? No large discussions about it? AMC. 

If you’re wondering why I’m writing this post, why do I care? 

it’s because I’m genuinely confused as to why — when I told my friend to buy GME at 30 dollars and showed him hundreds of posts from here, I demonstrated that  the squeeze was inbound, I taught him all the concepts that went into the MOASS theory, the 🚀 🌝 mission was about to commence— he went ahead and waited until GME was at 150, bought a single share, and then bought 200 shares of AMC at its peak and is now holding the bag as he rightfully should. 

AMC had no fundamental reason for a squeeze, it has like a 50% SI as a percentage of float which is still high... but it wasn’t even close to a perfect set up that GME had. 


AMC was actually a dying company unlike (GME which is also dying) but it was like the difference between dying in a cardboard box and dying while cozy warm and strung out in a hospital bed surrounded by your family.

And lastly, AMC HAD NO DD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $FB DD Valuation - Actual investing thread I'm going to aim for a quick write up so forgive my lack of fluidity. As always with investing, I invite counterpoints and criticisms/holes etc. of my pov.

Start with valuation - What should be the forward multiple for a stock like this. Practically every social media names trade at ~50+ forward multiple, each of course with diff verticals/growth rates/opportunities obv.

Mega cap names are trading at ~30 or so. Google is about there, msft and aapl are a tad higher and amzn trades in its own level largely due to bezos and what he's created etc.

The market trades at 22x.

Facebook trades at ~21x.

Of this forward multiple (its expected earnings), one can presume there isn't much contribution from whatsapp due to the egregiously low multiple of 21. (no one is expecting whatsapp to suddenly monetize to the extent it produces ~2,4,10 billion in revenue in the next ~handful of years.) Analyst expect 12.5~ eps in the next year, this gives the ~21x.

Lets break fb into parts - fb/insta/whatsapp (lets just assume oculus/vr doesn't surmount to anything).

whatsapp purchased for ~20b..insta 1. We know more about insta's contribution and with its greater growth and higher monetization (2/3rds of new add growth) we could probably assume it with at least a 30-40 multiple, what...200b market cap (snap is 100 and insta has 4x more users etc. I think 200 is conservative and fair, Id say more but w/e..200). Whatsapp has now over 2 bil users, likely ~2.5. This also would trade at 30-40x at what? 100 billion? Again, I'd say more, much more actually but let's just go with that right now.

This is important now -- fb is 750. They hold 70~ in net cash so the biz collectively is worth 680.

Insta is 200, whatsapp is 100...fb would be left with the remaining (BUT let's not forget there are efficiencies gained so let's say that in totality is worth 30 or w/e). We're left with FB, just facebook worth 350b. Now its a waste of time to discuss fb's reach and its continued growth etc etc because we should all know that already.

HERES THE BIG POINT - Assuming insta is worth 200, whatsapp 100, and as said above, their multiple is 30-40 (which I guarantee you would be the case considering every social media company and most tech names with growth similar to these --------- facebook would be left at a 350b valuation with a what...~10-15 forward multiple.

Now, who the fk would think a company the reach of facebook.com, the #4 downloaded app ahead of snap regularly, with growing users every year and stable users in n/a & eu ..with growing arpu YoY..should trade at 12 forward earnings.

Mark my words, fb will do what apple did, it will do what mu has recently done, it will be re-rated and the st will shortly forget the arguments of why fb traded at 20x while the market and all its peers are trading 50% higher. Break fb up (it wont happen), by all means..these stocks alone or together, are worth way more than 750.

Now as for apple and whatsapp very quickly and maybe I'll comment about it more in detal if people converse about it.

Apple - Unity just reported (with 50% ads, much less targeting ability than fb) apple should impact 6% or so of their revenue. Snap's guidance and commentary didn't seemed concerned. Facebook, as analysts and others have suggested, are likely going to lose 1-5% revenue. This equates just 3-4 months of pause in the stock, if not less, it's not this glorified terror that is going to ruin fb. It's nothing. no one will actually care after it passes lol.

2nd about whatsapp. whatsapp has like 60% or so of india's smartphone uses and in a few months, are going to announce their 'super app' integration with that big retailer I forgot the name, look it up if you care. They are trying to replicate wechat and become an app where people message each other, call each other, purchase food, purchase clothes, buy airplane tickets, show snap stories, etc. And they will also have facebooks data of those .5 bil users as well to help with suggestions/ads etc. TLDR - whatsapp is going to contribute 200-300 billion in market cap to fb in the next 3-4 years thru actual monetization.

The ONLY case you can make for fb trading this low is that you think it will be replaced 10-15 years from now or w/e..In which case, it shouldn't reflect this much in the stock as of right now. ONCE they show notably, real declines in users, stagnation in revenue, etc..we can panic and trade it closer to the market, but that is NOT the case right now. What will happen is - facebook will begin to trade closer to its peers and even more when they see continued growth in their top line - which will come from whatsapp's domination of india and maybe even brazil? Also, in 10-20 years, those weaker countries will start growing more in arpu, which would be HUGE for growing fb's top line. Something I've learned is - snap/tiktok, twitter, reddit, discord, netflix, youtube, insta, fb, can ALL live among each other. Each offers its own utility to each user. The harder would be for tiktok/snap to break into fb's territory rather than the other way around. Fb/insta 'profiles' will be here 20 years from now.

TLDR: I think fb is going to ~double in 3 years and triple in ~5. It should be at least 30% higher than its current price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you lost big, we've all been there. I've won and lost big many times; there's always a way back. (Trades in comments) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO massive growth prospects, the importance of addressable market size (TAM) and revenue per customer (CLV) FUBO TV is a sports focused “cable on the internet” streaming service, replacing your cable package (avg. $100+ per month) for $65 per month. In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.

These numbers mean two things: First, **FUBO has a proven product** with traction and growth. Second, it has **just started to penetrate a massive market**. While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO. **It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.**

There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.

Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.

At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $7.5 million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.

In fact, **at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.** This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to "cover" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes "its only a loss when you sell." The version for shorts would be "its only a loss if you close out your short positions."

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the "new" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay "retarded" longer than funds can stay solvent. The "paper hand" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **"Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them."** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles."** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **"If his forces are united, separate them"** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving "weak-hands" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some "paper hands", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

Cathie from ARK investments is [planning her own space exploration etf.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/13/cathie-woods-ark-invest-plans-space-exploration-etf-arkx.html) Cathie has grown an enormous cult following and you can bet there will be plenty of interest. Currently UFO is the only space exploration etf in the market, and has only been around a year. Options just became available last week due to the rising volume. 

Since the announcement we’ve seen spce make a huge run. Spce was an obvious choice but there are many other companies set to be bought up. Cathie likes to have ~50 companies in her etfs. Speculation which companies she decides to add can be tough, so this is why I’m playing UFO. There’s likely to be several gems that can easily 2x or 3x in the coming months if not more. Once we have more details and announcements on ARKX, hype will go way up from where it is now. 

Here’s a few other reasons why UFO is both a value and momentum play:

Satellite, tourism, and telecom are now economically viable thanks to the decreasing launch costs achieved by spaceX. 

Location based ride sharing and food delivery are rapidly growing because of the power of satellite-enabled navigation. 

The formation of the U.S. Space Force.

The option volume is currently low therefore UFO has wide bid ask spreads but I expect this to change in the upcoming months.

I opened my account last Saturday around 6 AM, initiated the transfer and was given a deadline of 2/8. Well it was fully transferred by 2/3 at 5 AM. 

Steps:

1. Buy 1 cheap stock

2. Transfer everything else but the cheap one from step 1. (This is in case they transfer it wrong ...like mentioned [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0j3e/done_fck_rh/gm48ekb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)) If that happens, your account will still remain active because of this cheap stock. 

3. Always keep that cheap stock until you decide when you want to deactivate.

4. You can keep that account open for ease of tax documents in 2021, then deactivate. 

Or


Remove that last share and deactivate your account after RH IPOs.

They will want to show growth (as a public company you have to disclose numbers), hard to show growth when customers are leaving.


 Couple important things:

Check your statements in RH. More than likely you will see that any position you have created is listed under Margin. Call up the other broker, inform them of the situation, make sure it is all under cash account. Do not have margin on in new account and be 100% positive that your shares will not be loaned out. 

Other brokers will take time to approve you for options trading...surprise surprise, real brokers doing real things. 

Each transfer from RH will cost $75...while you are on the phone with the new broker, ask them and they may cover the fee...after all, they are gaining a customer so $75 isn’t going to hurt them.

##Make sure live quotes are enabled.
(they are not by default.)

These tourists are pissing in your favorite bathroom constantly, asking a ton of stupid questions about some local event, leaving their trash everywhere, and generally acting like complete and total rubes.

Months go by.

You've started adding a little whiskey to your lattes in the morning to get over the hangover from the night before. somehow the attention of the clowns has caused the Starbucks to expand and now there's a side section with a Mall of America and the last fully stocked Barnes & Noble.

"Fuck you all, get out of my town!" you scream in a drunken rage one morning, but the cop on the corner just shakes his head at you. "Go home. You're drunk."

"Fuck off Greg." you mutter, and glance at your bank account.

A DD I found previously on WSB from u/drrona but aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

https://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

Chart broke out of a downward wedge finally. Let’s see it break $100 by earnings _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice for transferring from RH -> Fidelity So it seems like a lot of people are having issues with transferring away from Robinhood, I was able to successfully get all my assets away with relatively little difficulty, so I'll share my process in hopes of helping others transfer with relative ease.

# Things to expect:

1. **YOUR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT WILL BE DEACTIVATED DURING THE TRANSFER. NO BUYING, SELLING, OR WITHDRAWING MONEY. YOU WILL STILL SEE YOUR ASSETS IN RH UNTIL THE TRANSFER COMPLETES.**
2. ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM ROBINHOOD SHOW UP AS MARGIN ASSETS. Once your assets finish transferring from RH, **call up Fidelity and ask them to convert the margin assets to cash assets.** Why does this happen? Robinhood makes every account a "limited margin" account by default since "Instant deposits" count as margin, because you are technically loaning RH's money to buy shares while your bank deposit clears. It doesn't matter if the cash is settled or not, it's the account type. RH wants to be able to use the shares you buy as collateral if a deposit doesn't go through.
3. NOT ALL ASSETS WILL TRANSFER AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR TRANSFER MAY SEEM COMPLETE BUT IF EVERYTHING IS NOT THERE IT IS NOT FINISHED. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST $75 IN YOUR FIDELITY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE TRANSFER COMPLETES. I got a little annoyed on this, Robinhood debits the brokerage account you transfer to for the $75 transfer fee, not debiting it from any settled cash you have with Robinhood first. This resulted in my Fidelity account getting charged the $75 transfer fee (and me getting margin called technically), and the \~$200 of settled cash with RH was stuck for a couple of days before finally getting transferred over. My transfer showed as complete on 2/3 (with assets and $75 fee) but the settled cash didn't transfer until 2/5.

# How to make it easier/less of a headache:

1. Make sure every transaction has settled/will settle before your ACATS request is acknowledged by RH. In personal experience, they acknowledge it within 2 business days, but assume it will happen immediately to be safe.
2. Sell any fractional shares. These don't get transferred and will be sold off anyways as part of the transfer. Idk if c\*\*\*\*\* gets sold or held since they are a different account technically, but regardless I'd not use RH for c\*\*\*\*\* anymore. (Can't fuckin say the word cuz automod)
3. Make sure NO MARGIN BALANCE (Instant Deposits or RH Gold) is being used. If they are, that will likely complicate things. This ties into #1 of making sure assets have settled, this includes deposits. If you are using any of your Instant deposit balance wait for the cash to settle first, otherwise you might get hit with some ridiculous margin debit when assets transfer. If you have a position that is using margin, probably best to talk to Fidelity before transferring to make sure you know what else is needed.

# Finally: DON'T "TRANSFER" BY SELLING ALL ASSETS ON RH AND BUYING BACK ON FIDELITY. YOU WILL PAY TAXES FOR THIS.

Good luck and FUCK ROBINHOOD.

I'm thinking of punting on Bumble (which will trade with the ticker BMBL) when the shares go live on 11th Feb. I'm writing this DD live as I'm fact finding, but here's my take on it.

**Personal experience:**

I've never needed to use a dating app personally, but I have numerous friends who absolutely live by Bumble and I've seen that it works long term (plenty of fun dates, followed by matching up and eventually marriage). My female friends who have used it love the fact that it is woman led and initiated, meaning they don't get inundated with belligerent sex pests like on other platforms, and the guys I know who use it like it because it means that there is less pressure to ooze sex appeal (that they arguably don't have) and be more honest in their profiles. It seems like a far cry from the clear market contender Tinder. As a product, if I were ever in the "available" in *that* market again, I'd probably consider using Bumble myself.

**Previous valuations:**

* Between 2016-2018 they were approached with multiple offerings of $500M - $1B \[1\]. Their revenue in this period ranged from $10m in 2016 to $190m. This means they were effectively trading at premium multipliers of between 50 (early on) and 5 (in 2018).
* In 2019 they were bought by Blackstone by $3B \[1\]. Their earnings for this year were $240m, meaning they effectively traded at a revenue premium multiplier of 12.
* We don't have 2020 numbers, but in 2018 there were 35 million users and this year there are 100 million users. I would imagine that their earnings have taken a hit this year with COVID (i.e. lockdowns preventing hookups) but this just means it might be a great opportunity to buy in now.

**Some other considerations:**

* It has been reported that dating app usage actually went up during lockdowns \[2\] which does seem to defy logic. So potentially this might mean a nice surprise at the first public earnings announcement.
* 5 million use it in the US \[3\] - which is some way behind Tinder despite having a very similar market offering. This means that there is growth potential in the user base in the US, and presumably elsewhere in the world too.
* As a long term hold, this has potential: most of the users of the app are aged less than 35 and this is a replenishing stock of potential customers from below.

It looks like trading will start at around $30 a share and a market capitalisation of between $6-8B. To put this in perspective, Match (who own Tinder) are currently valued at $41B - and they made $2.4B in revenue in 2020. This means Match current trades on a revenue multiplier of 17.

Assuming that Bumble can scale 2018 earnings with users, 2020 might see revenues of around $600M. If this is the case and they can attract a similar multiplier, this puts the potential market capitalisation at something like $10.2B. This means that the price could, in relatively short term after first reported earning period, increase to between $38-50. Of course beyond this there is still plenty of scope for increasing the size of their user base, and with it additional revenue in the future.

None of this is advice, and because this hasn't been previously listed it isn't so clear to see the long term valuation of the company and could easily be wrong and it tanks immediately. But I will be buying when the bell goes on the 11th because I think it is worth a punt.

Turns out there are over 1000 articles on it. But in doing that research I found a fairly accurate history of how this all started. And, just to be clear, a post on WSB did set the price of Silver skyrocketing; but, also to be clear, some reporters are just lazy.

#**Background**

- Monday, January 25, 2021, $GME stock reached a high price of $159 per share before dropping to $76. Even though the CNBC people were calling this “A Side Show,” they spent most of the day talking about it.

-Tuesday, January 26th, 2021, $GME closes at $147 per share. WSB goes Viral on news that Melvin Capital needed a 2.5 Billion dollar bail out.

-Wednesday, January 27th, 2021, WSB was national and international front-page news. $GME hits $350 per share.

##So, Yes, a Redditor did post on WSB about silver. Reuters ran a story about the post, then Metal Industry people wrote articles about the post after Reuters, then The Wall Street Journal said WSB moving away from $GME and into silver, then lazy journalism took over where other reporters just start copying other reporters’ articles [ - Here is a Good Read on that - ](https://observer.com/2015/04/journalisms-sourcing-problem/), and then when silver corrected on the same day $GME and $AMC took a hit, all the media blamed us._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Became debt free in one week- too life changing to not paper hand 🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will GME actually go up? I have seen a lot of data here, i don't fully understand. I see a lot of memes and a few conspiracies that may be true may not. I would like to just believe it will actually go up again but i'm sceptic. My feeling is that this are just a lot of people that don't want the hype to end and a ton of confirmation bias. Ofcourse, i can be completely wrong. The data seems convincing, i guess but i don't actually know enough to evaluate that shit, so you could probably convince me of anything using the same data.

So, to the people that aren't too emotional invested in this, not giving a fuck about hedgefounds, diamond hands etc:

Do you think GME will go up again? If so, do you actually think it's going to the moon or does it just go up to like 200 again?

Edit: I think there was a misunderstanding. Don't worry, i didn't buy anything. Just wanted to understand the whole thing better and maybe decide to buy a bit afterwards. I asked because the frontpage suggests that everything will go way up again, which i didn't really believed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ------------- Dear Elon ------------- GMEs gone down I'm wondering why

Dear mister “ I’m too good for calls or buy GME shares”, this will be the  last bullcase I ever send your ass, it’s been six days and still no  tweet, I don’t deserve it?

I know you got the last charts, the media published them perfect.

So here is are some questions. Can you buy stock in any company? What does that do to the company?

I am wondering if that is a better act then just buying there products they make. For instance, I'm a big fan of nippon ichi software, if I like the game I played should I buy stock? If a company goes under are you out more then you put in? What is the risk in that situation?

I'm not asking in the since to make a ton of money off it, but more on the level of helping the company. Does buying stock help the company in some way?


I also am wondering what happens if you have a ton of stock in a company. I remember in some older movies if you own the majority of the stock you have say in some of the actions a company makes. Is that actually how that works or is that just movie plot magic?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dont let others force you to make silly decisions to cover their losses All the twats on here posting "HOLD THE LINE" and "BUY AT THE DIP" at the end of the day no one knows where the stock is going. And absolutely everyone is in it for the money. The truth is the majority of those who want you to buy and hold GME stock want you to help recover their losses, they seem to think that if retail starts buying and holding it will drive the price up enough to cover their losses. Remember its YOUR money! not THEIRS! If you are on a roll... cash out, buy more, hold or whatever! and don't let others make you feel bad for their own foolish greedy decision making.

Not financial advice, i talk to my goldfish and genuinely believe he talks back to me_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that’s us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin\_capital\_13f\_q3\_2020\_put\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin_capital_13f_q3_2020_put_flags/)

Yeah, that’s right. Melvin is. Among others…  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let’s talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That’s 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I’m not recommending buying this stock. I’m also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast. 

TL;DR: 

IRBT  🚀🚀🚀  Let’s get ready to Roomba!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Damn gme is a hell of a ride, trying to use the remainder of my account to soften the blow, I think this hit probably damaged my ears or something because I STILL DIDNT HEAR NO BELL _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I developed PTSD from GME Watching the numbers going up and down, seeing your money going away, I had a loss of 80%, from $1500 to $300 (got in late) in GME.

Please consider that I'm just a retard and most likely just hate my wife's boyfriend. I'm no investment adviser and I just love this stock. 

&#x200B;

**What we saw until now:**

\- In a previous post we saw that two retards limit sell orders of 2500$ and 5000$ were successful. 

\- In most media, even the international ones, there is a big emphasis on that GME squeeze is lost. 

\- The media also strongly recommend to sell the shares, learn from our mistake, and move on... As if they have our best interest in mind. 

&#x200B;

**What didn't happen until now:**

\- The Squeeze

\- Only the retards are currently the ones actively going for the squeeze 

&#x200B;

**My hypothesis:** 

\-Why only the retards went for the squeeze until now?

\-Why other parties didn't went for the squeeze with us? 

\-Why are we encouraged to sell our shares?

\-Who is going to buy the shares we sell? Only HF? Or other POIs? 

&#x200B;

Imho the only correlation between most parties involved in GME events is greed. And as long as the squeeze doesn't happen, we should hold our shares, especially the ones with lost porn. Most likely they are going to be the ones who will profit the most, as it doesn't make sense for them to sell anyways. 

The game is still being played and most likely the ones who are going to profit from this are the most retarded/patient holders.  

Holding 140 GME shares. My estimate per share is 2500$ or above. 

With RC and the new management at GME 450$ per share by 2023 is anyways reasonable.

(GPRO) Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around. But investors will have to wait another year to see if it's enough to result in a profitable year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blackberry-Aktie über 20-Tage-Linie _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IMPORTANT: Newcomers read Oh hey fellow retards, I see you hopped onto the stonk train and pulled up to the WSB station. Welcome to the retarded corner of reddit - grab your wife and her boyfriend, put on your special helmets, and take a seat in your timeout chairs. Today we're going to discuss the basics of WSB culture, and a few do's and don'ts. 


*What exactly is WSB?*


We are a sub focused on making million to one odds bets on different meme stonks, typically chosen because of a funny/memelike/autistic ticker or some creatively retarded DD posted by some idiot with no understanding of market fundamentals who likely just barely passed high school (most of us, including myself). As most of us go broke and balls deep into debt from weekly calls, a few of us get incredibly lucky and their gain porn convinces the rest of us to get a second mortgage on our homes. As the crippling debt piles on, we post our losses so that we can show off our huge karma gains to our wife's boyfriend so he thinks we're cool like him. The story *always* ends well.


*Is WSB a movement?*


No retard. WSB was never intended to be a massive movement, and no the goal of WSB wasn't/isn't to "wage war against the rich". The goal is to become rich, so to wage a war against what we ultimately aim to achieve is rather counterproductive. If you're here because you think we care about/share your political/economic views, you're on the wrong sub *brotatoe*. WSB is about getting filthy rich, or ruining your financial situation for a majority of your adult life while trying. We don't aim to "stick it to the man", we all aspire to *BE* the man. If you haven't noticed, even u/MartinShkreli is a mod here.

Emphasis: *We do not care about your political views.*              *F off.*


*Didn't WSB intentionally orchestrate the GME short squeeze and collapse of several financial institutions?*


Well yes, and no. Yes, the GME short squeeze was a very popular DD being pushed for months - but the reasoning wasn't exactly to wage a war against big financial institutions. The main reason GME was being pushed so hard on here was because people wanted to make so many tendies that they could buy out the Wendy's they work the drive through at. The chaos that ensued because of the shortsqueeze is only an added bonus - Melvin can suck it. 


*"I only came here to join the movement against Wallstreet..."*


*F off*



*Do's and don'ts:*


As I mentioned (so many times, here's some rockets in case you skipped everything else above 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀), this sub is NOT a political movement, posting your politics on here is not acceptable. No matter what political party is currently on top, there are different plays you can make to get those sweet tendies. 

Do not post or promote your pump and dump schemes. Working together is great, what happened with GME was badass - but remember that there's a VERY thin line between teamwork and market manipulation (one of which being highly illegal).

DO enjoy and join in on our culture, call each other retards and autists, talk about your wife being gangbanged by your successful neighbors and you unsuccessfully tryna impress one of her boyfriends. Share your gains/losses - nothing gets me harder than seeing someone lose 40k. Make some ridiculous DD about some obscure company no one has ever heard about, and convince 20 retards to join you because we're all idiots. 


LASTLY - *Don't be a loser.*

*Now, fly you fools.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let me tell you about my weird ass dream from last night that relates to GME in a positive way. I swear to God this is not me memeing but I chose the meme flair anyway because I'll probably be wrong. I'm telling you guys first, but I had a dream last night where I was desperately picking some things off the ground yesterday and then suddenly I was literally dragged upwards (like my whole body was reversed forcefully). 

Even though I don't think about my dreams too often, I truly believe that my dream is a sign of the inevitability of GME mooning this week. I've always believed in the inevitability of GME mooning to greater heights than the ones already reached (that's why I didn't sell).

The shorts (me picking up things desperately from the ground) already know that they're fucked, and you can already guess what getting dragged up forcefully means (us apes buying shares).

In the case that I'm correct, I'm a fucking sage. In the case that I'm incorrect, I can just laugh it off in the end with you guys.

The dream was fucking weird and I needed to write about this.

No.

You need brass balls. You need to keep knocking on doors and hawking those bibles and vacuum cleaners.

Obviously, if you sell, you lose out on any gains you might make in future. Do you really want to live knowing what might have been? You can always just make more money by donating blood and semen.

Selling means you are saying "No" to the future, you are letting the past define you.

Holding, and even buying more, says "Yes" to the future. It says "Yes, I can do what I want! I am in control!"

And they don’t care if the stock is $350 or $50, they are making money either way. This stock is still highly volatile and day traders are making a killing.

Take the price action Monday and Friday last week:

Monday 2/1: open at 290, dip to 212, up to 255, dip to 226, up to 277, dip to 240, up to 260, dip to 232, up to 240, dip to 230, up to 251, dip to 215, up to 226 to close out the day.

Friday 2/5: open at 57, dip to 51, up to 88, dip to 66, up to 75, dip to 62, up to 66, dip to 59, up to 65, dip to 57, up to 62, dip to 59, up to 62 to close out the day.

Day traders are staring at charts, buying low and selling high for a few hours each day. And again, the share price is IRRELEVANT. They go to bed each night holding zero GME stocks, then buying them the next morning all over again.

Imagine the price goes from 57 to 62, in the span of 18 minutes, while you hold 5000 shares.

Something to think about!

P.S. if you’re an experienced 🦍 position trader with 💎 🖐🏾 🤚 , probably none of this is new to you. If you’re someone who just got Robinhood last week and lost some money on $GME, this ones for you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Please enjoy my loss story, featuring TSLA, shorting, options, one too many Negroni’s and my perfectly smooth ape brain. Some of you may enjoy this, and writing it down will hopefully ease my pain a bit. It’s nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.

Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$). 

Move ahead two months and it’s a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.

Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.

So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don’t really read, and click submit... aaaand that’s when my stock position vanished.

I had closed the wrong position.🤦🏻 Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss’ed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.

After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it’s not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.

Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.

1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake.
2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled.
3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit
4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.

So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. 🤦🏻

But that's about it, whatever happened to the hedge funds, did they actually lose a ton of money in the end or what? Were you guys fucked over? Did the movement lose steam and become a meme? Did you win?

It's in a great position for the recovery, with high pent up demand for travel.

My Positions: Long 500 shares @ $11.52, and long (8) July 2021$12 calls @ $2.19

They integrate, aggerate and serve up a large number of airlines, hotels, cruises, and railways for many large travel sites you love and know.  There's 3 major players in that space, they are the  second largest and gaining ground.     Video about  these 3:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\_bryBG1u8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bryBG1u8s)

On Feb 19 2020, pre pandemic - SABR traded at $22.36, 78% above it's closing price of Feb 5 2021. On Feb 4th 2021, SABR closed at $12.82, a price not closed above since the beginning of the pandemic - March 4, 2020. It has been trading sideways for awhile now in a channel, and is starting to see some traction and large prints in recent days. I think this is telling, and SABR will continue it's move upward from here. it briefly touched $13.10 at Feb 5th open.

With 317M outstanding shares, the 62M shares short are not super significant, however, there is 102% institutional ownership, and demand for the stock will only increase as the recovery beings to show signs of really happening.

Recent 13F positions show institutional ownership of 410M shares, excluding the 13Gs. so uh, that's 40M more shares than shares outstanding, perhaps that's where the 60M shares shorted come into play also. Not to mention all the owners that aren't required to submit 13F forms. Not to mention call and put positions which I can't see. I know they can play with the dates they submit a bit here, I think overall it's positive data for the stock listed here.

They spent the pandemic upgrading their technology stack and appear to be hiring aggressively.

All in all, it appears we're on the path to recovering from the pandemic, with vaccines being pushed out, and a pent up demand for travel. This stock is in a great position that even if it only halfway fills the gap between today's close and it's where it was before the pandemic dive, you're still looking at a 40% upside from where it sits. I think that is extremely likely to happen in 2021.

This  is some type of academic research paper just prior to the pandemic I thought was interesting:

And why I hate/love Robinhood. I was pretty pissed off when RH blocked buying of the meme stocks.  $GME, $BB, $NOK.  But for a different reason than most.

$GME:

I caught the train late.  4 shares.  Bought and sold in the same hour.  Made about $400.  (I'm shocked that people bought at $360.  I've bought some stocks at the top of the rollercoaster before.  But DAMN son, never have I bought a stock that was obviously nuts).

$BB:

Bought some, after seeing the noobs jumping all in.  I set up a stop-loss and my stock sold at a small loss.  If RH wouldn't have froze the stock my stop-loss wouldn't have triggered and I'd have $400 in profit.

$NOK:

Invested (repeat, INVESTED) in $NOK back in October when news broke about the deal with NASA.  Not selling this one for some time.  I have no idea why $NOK was even considered to be the same shit as $GME.

&#x200B;

I was pissed at RH because my stop-loss triggered.  But only slightly.  I was really pissed off because I started the day off intending on buying a PUT $GME.  Cause the bubble was going to burst.  I don't think RH froze trading because of some conspiracy BS.  And I don't really care (because the game is rigged, always has been).  RH probably stopped the trading due to not having the assets to cover the trading.  Not to mention their servers fuck up all the time (they can't handle trade volume at a stupid level).

&#x200B;

I'm switching my main broker over to WeBull.  (I opened up an account with the 4 month ago, just never used it).  The tools they offer and the trading hours are far better.  Downside, they don't offer trading for OTC stocks.

I'm staying with RH (why I love RH)

* so I can gamble on shitty OTC stocks like $RYCE.
* They offer instant deposit and settlement free.
* The interface is good looking.
* They are an American made company.
* I can gamble on fake money.

Why I hate RH:

* The platform always crashes (trade volume too high)
* The app always resets my login time restriction with each update (I hate having to login after a 5min wait)

PSA for the 7 million new subs:

* If you're triggered by words like Retard, you should probably leave.
* If you don't know much about options, stay the fuck away from them.  (I dabble.  If you want to actually invest stick to stocks that pay dividends and have a good history/future.  If you want to gamble try pennystocks.  They are fun.)
* If you have to ask:  Did I miss the train?  You have...
* $GME is not going to rocket again.  Take the loss.
* Don't buy the hype.  Exploit the hype.

$GME is not going to rocket again.  We got one up on the big dogs.  I always wondered if it would be possible to hype a stock so much that it would get to the level of $GME.  But, learned that directing the hive mind is like trying to heard cats.

&#x200B;

The big dogs have already changed their strategy.  They will recover.

&#x200B;

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  One day r/wallstreetbets will be banned at the federal level.

&#x200B;

Other thoughts on RH stopping trading:

* They stopped the use of margin for buying $GME and etc.  Which is something that actually did protect the end users. 
* If the buying frenzy continued their shitty servers would have gone up in flames.  Happens every time a stock goes crazy.
* This was not a freeze on trading for a moral reason.  (legit reasons to freeze trading, example:  Lukin Coffee)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNDL DD - 2/6/21 Sundial is a Canadian cannabis company 🌱 that has shown a lot of bullish trends lately. I wanted to share some DD as recent technical and fundamentals bullish trends have developed:

• SNDL management team effectively manages its cash balance 💵 through registered offerings. The Company has ~$600M in cash with essentially no debt. This means they are poised for strategic growth with low liquidity risk. 

• Political and Macro trends are favoring legalization in the US (~25B  annual market opportunity by 2023) with legalization being brought to the senate we can potentially see this market open up for SNDL by 2022-2023. 

• GWPH was just acquired by Jazz Pharma for ~$7B - companies and investors are taking notice that cannabis is not just recreational, medicinal market is massive. 🌎

• If the company retains above ~$1 for ~5 days then it meets listing requirements for NASDAQ, super bullish signal. 📈

• The call to put ratio is 5:1. Literally 5 calls for every put being bought. This is super bullish because the buying interest will continue to rise. 🙌🏼💎

• Investors are hungry for this stock, even with the outstanding shares recently issued; they barely made a dent in the stock price. 🤤 

Speculation: 45M shares were traded on Friday in two seconds (2/5) this was either a massive buyer coming in or a massive short position being covered. Regardless, some whales have taken notice. 🐳🚀🌱📈


I'm all in here, ~500 shares + over $1000 invested in long dated calls .05-1 strikes. $5 PT (200% increase) by EoM.

Feels great, man. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bloomberg: Robinhood Traders Have a Troubled Track Record of Stock Picking [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium)

&#x200B;

Back in May, a Reddit poster hit WallStreetBets with a sure-thing tip on Scorpio Tankers Inc. The oil shipper, trading at one-fifth the value of its assets, was a screaming buy with storage rates soaring, insiders leveraging up and oil vaulting back after briefly going negative.

&#x200B;

There’s an opportunity to see “100% returns within the next year,” the user said.

&#x200B;

Eight months later, the reward: a 17% loss.

&#x200B;

Another WallStreetBets poster was similarly breathless about their bright idea to short Tesla Inc. in 2018. The outcome: a 1,330% loss, not including borrow fees, assuming they stuck with it.

&#x200B;

Picking stocks is hard. Almost nobody has an edge, and it’s no mark of shame when a call fails to pan out.

&#x200B;

But in all the hagiography being bestowed on Reddit traders who latched on to GameStop Corp. before it rocketed skyward, it’s worth remembering that a big enough sample of predictions will always yield a few winners. Evidence of investing genius elsewhere is hard to find.

&#x200B;

It is these cautionary tales on stock-picking that are documented in research covering this era of WallStreetBets. A new paper finds that on average when retail traders on Robinhood Markets buy a stock, it doesn’t perform better over the next three to 20 days.

&#x200B;

In fact, it tends to do a little worse.

&#x200B;

A speculator's record trading GameStop would depend on their timing

“Robinhood investors’ evident lack of skill in aggregate is consistent with commission-free investors behaving as uninformed noise traders,” wrote Gregory W. Eaton and Brian S. Roseman from Oklahoma State University and T. Clifton Green and Yanbin Wu from Emory University.

&#x200B;

The authors also found that stocks with buzz on WallStreetBets see a spike in activity on Robinhood a few days later, a sign there’s likely much overlap between the two communities.

&#x200B;

To isolate investment skill, the academics adjusted 2020 returns for recent price moves and risk factors like valuations and the size of a company. The upshot: When you strip out the possibility that these traders are simply chasing market trends, they don’t actually end up picking future winners.

&#x200B;

The results don’t mean retail investors across all brokerages are bad stock pickers. In fact, the four scholars found that increased buying of a company’s shares by the group overall did predict higher future returns. The problem for the Robinhood contingent is that they typically pile onto a stock nearly a week after the bulk of their peers.

&#x200B;

“Although retail traders in aggregate appear to invest in the same types of securities that are popular among Robinhood investors, we find that the broader measure of retail trading leads Robinhood trading by several days, which may help explain the difference in performance,” the authors wrote.

&#x200B;

The research covers only the first eight months of last year because Robinhood stopped publicizing the number of users holding each stock in August.

&#x200B;

To be fair to Robinhood, it seems likely the pattern is not limited to their platform. Another paper has shown smartphones in general make people more likely to buy risky assets and chase past returns -- partly because apps allow them to trade in the evening without thinking too much.

&#x200B;

Bragging Rights

As the GameStop rally comes back to Earth, the new research may offer a gut-check to amateurs whose bragging rights over the past week reached fever pitch.

&#x200B;

Yet plenty of them would take issue with its conclusions, given how many in this new investing generation appear to have minted fortunes while besting hedge funds -- largely empowered by zero-commission trading platforms.

&#x200B;

When markets were lashed by Covid in the roughly six months through July 2020, a portfolio comprising the most popular stocks on the Robinhood app returned an annualized 105%, according to Wolfe Research.

&#x200B;

GameStop Corp., the poster child of retail speculation, is still more than 238% higher this year even after its recent plunge. Throw in Sundial Growers Inc. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and the Robinhood crowd would seem to have several stories of incredible success.

&#x200B;

The phenomenon remains relatively young, so firm conclusions about the stock-picking skills or otherwise of those involved might be premature. And to the speculators who have reaped profits on these platforms, it may not matter much whether it was down to picking winners or following the momentum of the market.

&#x200B;

The success of retail traders in general has been documented by various academics across different time frames and methods. In a paper last year, Ivo Welch, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed a portfolio of common Robinhood holdings beat market benchmarks and a quant factor model in the two years through mid-2020.

&#x200B;

Welch’s work focused on stocks widely owned by users, rather than those seeing an increase in buying on the platform. The recent paper focused squarely on whether more purchases from the Robinhood crowd actually led to superior performance -- or not.

&#x200B;

“Our evidence suggests that zero-commission investors in aggregate behave as noise traders, with changes in Robinhood ownership being unrelated to future returns,” the academics wrote._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why in long on MNKD (credit to u/yoyo_mas_cousin)

Years ago, while holding a true medical breakthrough MNKD who has an amazing inhaled insulin, they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps. They pretended that A led to B and it was all a natural process, when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with BS FUD. Seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game.


There used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable (from SEC data) and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to MNKD but other favourites they used to attack.


Difference with GME is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90% losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar.


Sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process, and I believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share, down 95% plus. The naked short selling rule was called the "madoff exception" because Bernie madoff helped get the rule in place "to help provide liquidity to the market"


Since then, the markets have been completely rigged, and it doesn't matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down. They just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying. GME should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed, that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise.


MNKD still kicking after all these years and seems to be finally winning the war, but the majority of shorts already closed out after whacking the stock 95%+.

I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced.

Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options.

Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again.

# What is PinDuoDuo

PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\* Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla. 😂\*\*

**By the numbers:**

Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB 14.2 BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market.

Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors.

&#x200B;

1.There is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same.

On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of  food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition.

2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why. [Lots of companies are working with them](https://agencychina.com/blog/pinduoduo-for-china-cross-border-e-commerce/) for cross-border social commerce. The retail market for overseas Chinese with family in China is well in the Trillions RMB. Wall Street just missed here.

3. PinDuoDuo dominates in China's 2nd and 3rd Tier cities. [Tier 1 cities like Shanghai have experienced slowed growth](http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2020-11/10/content_76895684_10.htm), while PDD increases penetration there anyway. Seeing as China is posted the best performing economy of any of the major economies by far, it seems that this fact is more important than the market has realized.

4. Amazing technology. Here is where I laugh my ass off at the Morningstar's of the world. They don't know shit about how hard it is to build good software. PinDuoDuo's software has an amazing track record and they are very focused on improving the customer experience constantly. Customer experience is the differentiator for the business.

5. Not a short squeeze you have to catch the run up or any of that. I like the stock for several years. I expect the company to be the largest retailer in China, the world's second largest retail market and growing rapidly, by the end of 2021.

6. Gradually reducing the cash burn from marketing spend. The reason why PinDuoDuo has only posted a single profit is because of the need to quickly acquire customers in a very competitive and fast growing market. Their reliance on marketing spend is dropping rapidly as they start to win more and more customers through brand loyalty and reputation. Their product is very sticky, social, and nurtured by social network density. We can expect a monster earnings report of 3/10.

My Bullish Price Target: $375

I am basing this on an aggressive revenue multiple that compares their 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous **290%**. If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also  paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock.

&#x200B;

My Bearish Price Target:  $235

The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data  can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation.

Positions:

\~$100 C Jan 22

&#x200B;

\~$250 C Jan 22

If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time.

Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point.

I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.

Personally, I invest first and *then* do my DD after. Why you ask? Well, I am retarded. But more importantly, this two step approach allows me to enjoy two of my favorite things: (1) panic buying like a true WSB autist, and (2) justifying my YOLO ***after the fact*** with actual logic, reason, and of course, our favorite—numbers! I call it *The Way of the Autist.*

So, now that you have already leveraged everything and dumped your life savings into TIGR after seeing the **TL;DR**/**Positions** above, you have completed the first step of *The Way of the Autist*.

To be clear, if after seeing the **TL;DR**/**Positions** above, you thought to yourself, "if Lieutenant [u/Brassmonkeynutzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Brassmonkeynutzz/) made money, I can too because APES TOGETHER STRONG 🦍🍌💎🤚🏻🤪" then you belong here.

However, if you are still reading and have not invested in TIGR yet, it is likely too late, and you should consider an ETF instead.

&#x200B;

**ANYWAYS**, now that you are jacked to the tits on TIGR calls and shares, let's talk about ***why*** you are so glad you decided to invest first and ask questions later.

&#x200B;

**2.** **RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH AURORA MOBILE LIMITED WILL GENERATE FURTHER GROWTH:**

&#x200B;

On January 5, 2021, Aurora Mobile, a leading mobile developer service provider in China, "announced that it has entered into a partnership agreement with UP Fintech Holding Limited (NASDAQ: TIGR)." [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurora-mobile-partners-leading-online-090000290.html).

&#x200B;

**A. AURORA WILL EXPAND USER BASE AND ENGAGEMENT:**

&#x200B;

Aurora's industry-leading artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning capabilities will provide push notification services and other capabilities to help Tiger Brokers improve user engagement and expand its use base.

&#x200B;

**B. AURORA'S DETAILED** **ANALYTICS WILL FURTHER EXPAND USER ENGAGEMENT AND GROWTH:**

&#x200B;

Aurora's services and "machine learning-based data processing and analysis capabilities \[will\] help Tiger Brokers gain comprehensive insights on its user needs, provide targeted and matched personalized experience to cater to user’s interest, and improve user stickiness and engagement, as a result, to conduct dynamic smart operations." [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurora-mobile-partners-leading-online-090000290.html).

&#x200B;

This partnership could send TIGR interstellar. 👨‍🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**3.** **RECENT INSTITUTIONAL BACKING FROM A NOTORIOUS SHORT SELLER:**

&#x200B;

On February 2, 2021, Kerrisdale Capital who has a reputation for making "successful bets against Chinese internet companies, came out with a long position in" TIGR, calling it "The Robinhood of China." [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html) (great article for any of you that actually know how to read).

&#x200B;

Now, I know what you are thinking: FUCK ROBINHOOD. I absolutely agree. The mass fraud that they perpetrated on the retail market with GME, AMC, BB, etc. is an absolute travesty. But the point here is, TIGR has insane revenue and user growth and is continuously expanding its business according to available data and information. It's platform is user friendly and is attracting a lot of attention from retail investors, institutional investors, and start up companies seeking to go public via an IPO.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

&#x200B;

TIGR is the next big trading platform that global, individual and institutional investors are showing an increasing interest in. It has the potential to continue its growth trajectory based purely on its impressive numbers, which speak for themselves.

&#x200B;

Also, I believe TIGR will continue to gain international interest in light of the recent media spotlight on retail trading. Interestingly, the "government mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have helped fuel a surge in online trading . . . ." [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html). And even though you might not expect it, "Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week despite concerns about its restrictions on transactions." [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html).

**SUMMARY:** Getting into TIGR now is like getting in on sunlight before there was fucking sunlight.

Lieutenant [u/Brassmonkeynutzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Brassmonkeynutzz/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I broke my daily gain record with GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ELY might be a solid play post earnings. Callaway Golf is the leading brand in golf products, they have solid fundamentals and are poised to continue being the top dog in the golf game. They are also profitable, with a profit margin in Q3 of over 11%. Cyclically Q4 has always been bad so I can see a dip buy after earnings. ( see their 2019 Q4 for reference )

Their Q3 income was 475.56 million, I don’t expect Q4 to be that strong and it’s very possible that they post a - EPS due to Q4 and the start of Q1 being the “off season” for golf (unless you are a boomer in retirement who lives in Florida). the golfing industry is a 80+ billion dollar industry and $ELY is poised to continue to capture the lions share of money that is spend on non venue purchases. Sporting and recreation will see more people as we exit COVID, and I predict a great year for the company after earnings on the 10th. This stock has the ability to grow to 38$ a share by the end of the year. Buying golf balls, and clubs is a necessity to golf, you can’t play without them. (Unless you get creative). Every time someone shanks a shot into a pond $ELY has the chance to sell another golf ball. For every new young businessman who has to go golfing with his boss for the 1st time that’s a new set of clubs that get purchased ( or rented if the venue offers that ). As long as the game grows, which it is,( rounds of golf logged in 2020 increased by almost 20%, and female interest in the game has started to pick up ) I see this company steadily growing.  

$ELY also has a dividend that is poised to grow, it’s extremely small right now but that will most likely grow long term. The only red flag I see with this company is it’s 1.24 billion $ worth of debt.

True and false NARRATIVES!!! The deposit trust and clearing corporation literally jacked up collateral rates to 100% out of nowhere for every single broker...Who told them to do this? How did they determine this? Did anyone know about this?

Fake Narrative: We weren't smart enough to get out, we were bag holders, we didn't know the stock market, etc etc. ITS ALL YOUR STUPID FAULT.

Real Narrative: The DTCC demanded large ransoms from brokers and if they couldn't pay then they couldn't buy shares. So the brokers shutdown buying trades and the stock went down. They robbed us blind right before the squeeze happened. Literally illegal robbery. I say we subpoena the dtc and find out who and what and how and why they can arbitrarily determine collateral rates to brokers to the point they can shut down entire stocks!!!!

I mean....are we supposed to accept that anytime a hedge fund gets short squeezed they can just keep doubling down until they win or if they are losing they can just call up the DTCC and have them demand ransoms from brokers?

UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some really loss porn. 182k to 30k. No words. STILL HOLDING. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An honest question for all you 💎👋 autists out there: With your 💎👋 Diamond Hands, how do you realize your profits? You can't make actual gains until you sell.

Who would buy your $1,000 GME shares when you're ready to sell? Honestly, you all keep saying "$1,000 is the goal". Well then, who would buy at that level, knowing it's going to tank immediately after? For a sell to occur there has to be a buyer.

TSLA 5k -> 19k , GME 19k -> 97k, what’s next :) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seen a lot of bots, seen a lot shills, seen a lot of people telling bag holders to sell. If you’re not a bot and this is what you’re doing you’re going to help in having your options trading abilities revoked. This goes for those of you who are commanding people to buy as well.... The SEC (EDIT NOT SEC, SECRETARY OF STATE (Mass.)) is considering (EDIT; ARGUING) limiting options trading for retail investors and if all of you smooth brains (who aren’t bots) keep telling people to “sell, you fucking retard” you are advocating for ALL OF US to lose our ability to trade options. Yes, that means YOU won’t be able to buy puts against retards who bought into GME at $350 like me okay? You wont be able to buy option calls for stocks you like that you feel have been trampled by GME hype. 

So what’s the point? Who the fuck cares? We all SHOULD care. This place used to be a space for people to post loss porn, gains, plays, ideas, and DD for people to react however they did. Suddenly this turned into a space where everyone seems to be my financial advisor and I just want it to go back to people calling eachother idiots, NOT telling someone “you should sell now, if you don’t you’re actually retarded” OR “buy this stock right now tO tHe mOoN” or worse, “EVERYONE BUY AT 1pm” which is illegal. Wtf happened here??? If you want to hold and tell everyone you’re holding GREAT!! Post your loss porn or your gains a month from now so i can laugh or cry about it, fuck. If you are that chad who’s been on crusade financially advising retarded apes to sell over the past two weeks please PLEASE fuck off. If you are a retarded ape advising retarded apes to buy at a given time, please fuck off or go to college and join a hedge fund so you can do that which is illegal legally. Cheers happy holding, happy shilling, happy shwacking whatever is you want to do do it happily please and stop whining BOTH SIDES.

My strategy is to try to dollar cost average down as close to $60 long term as possible (I'm around $95 a share right now). I don't really know how to value GME without all this chaos going on around it, but I think $20-60 might be fair?

Since it seems whatever market forces (lmao) are moving the price right now wants it to stay between $60-$70 I don't think it will go down below that unless a mass selloff happens for some reason. If it does I think I should have at least 25% left over to invest to bring the average down closer to maybe $40 if it goes really south.

TL;DR: Low risk, high reward.

On Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow the same exact pattern. While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive, and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

[https://preview.redd.it/lpd7nbttyxf61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65d6bc072f237dba0a82c7c03052952b78e200d](https://preview.redd.it/lpd7nbttyxf61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65d6bc072f237dba0a82c7c03052952b78e200d)

Yahoo Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as "Neutral" despite the amount of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term. People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is neither stock dead in the water yet? Why do both stocks show more resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily. Everyone is waiting until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can make "easy money".

Consensus: Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum that GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME because they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike wasn't relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point, AMC's shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype). If the momentum dies, then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this stock are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price for months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of having to pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the people shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

$AMC._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My hopes for GME Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.

I think three things need to happen for $GME to go up 🚀🌑.

First, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a 🌈🐻 that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.

Second, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares 🤚💎✋ and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!

Third, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being 🌈🐻 about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.

TlDr: This fight can be about big money fighting many retards' small money. But big money's position will weaken when they see there are actually good reasons to be long on GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How the opera was playing _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’m a paper handed bitch.

Disclaimer: this is my first time actually writing out a DD. I don't know how to add pictures and charts and what not.

That aside, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN BROTHER

Ok, so, $WWE. World Wrestling Entertainment. The shit that nobody has watched since Stone Cold was beating the fuck out of Vince and Kurt Angle was drenching Vince's daughter with white, creamy milk.

The company is not doing great right now. COVID and wrestling do not mix at all. In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody can go see the shows. So this is a rebound play, obviously.

So here's the good. Starting with Wrestlemania in March, WWE will begin having limited amounts of fans in attendance. By year end, I'd think there is a decent chance at full attendance events. Maybe, I don't know. 

Having full houses soon is the obvious recovery angle, but even if houses aren't full, here's something to consider: WWE on the year as a whole increased operating income to 208 million. Thats a nearly 80% increase from 2019. The bulk of that comes from a rise in content fees. The point here is that even with limited ticket sales, WWE is smart about bringing in money.

One of the less obvious angles is the new deal with Peacock. The WWE network is a big source of revenue for WWE, but its now being completely migrated to Peacock Premium/Peacock ad free. WWE network has cost 9.99 per month forever and generally has a subscriber base of around 2 million. I don't know the details of what NBC Universal is paying for the WWE Network content (which includes every new PPV, every old PPV from WWE, ECW and WCW, and a huge catalog of original content), but what I do know is that as young as it is, Peacock already has more than 20 million subscribers. A lot of that may be free subscribers who won't get the WWE Network content, but assuming a quarter of them are paid subscribers and that 40% of WWE Network subscribers move to Peacock (very conservative), the WWE Network potential audience will reach 6 million people. And this is just a gut feeling, but if you're already paying for Peacock, why not tune in and catch a little bit of Wrestlemania? One of the undersold parts of this entire deal, I think anyway, is the potential for increased ad revenue. Now, Peacock offers an ad free subscription but WWE don't give a fuck. They have "commercials" during PPV events and advertise shit all through the show. Those advertisements could reach a lot more people now.

Now, here's the big one that a lot of people don't know about if you don't follow wrestling: the Saudi Deal. WWE is has an agreement to do two shows per year in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis pay 50 million per show. The Saudi shows obviously didn't happen this year, and WWE was not paid for them, it simply extended the contract until shows can resume. The agreement is for ten years.

Now, a hundred million dollars doesn't seem like a ton in the context of a publicly traded company, but considering that WWE raised its operating income, and I'm repeating myself, by nearly 80 percent to 208 million WITHOUT the expected 100 million from Saudi Arabia speaks pretty loudly.

Now, despite the pandemic troubles, $WWE has been trading mostly flat since COVID. It's at 49.23 now, down about 6-7 percent from Thursday close. It hit a low directly after COVID restrictions started at 34.13, but rebounded 44 dollars within about a month. If I didn't mention it before, WWE revenue actually went up this year. A measly 1%, but given the obstacles it's faced I'd say thats actually impressive. 

The timing of trying to play this one I really couldn't tell you. I think there's good room for growth in shares, but I wouldn't try playing weeklies on it. LEAPs I think could probably print you some money.

I'm gonna go ahead and just sort of close this out now cause I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing. I much prefer stealing DD from the people here smarter than I am but fuck it. 

Fuck ape gang nobody is gonna see this shit anyway.

Edit: 10 1/21/22 65C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Synopsys to the moon Hello friends, it is your local cybersecurity investment friend. Today I wanted to provide a quick analysis on a company in the Cybersecurity sector that people haven't really noticed yet $SNPS (Synopsys).

Synopsys derives revenue from two main avenues, semiconductor and integrated circuit designs as well as software security. They also do consulting for both. Electronic Design Automation is 60% Revenue, Consulting is 30% Revenue, Security is 10% Revenue. With that cleared up, I'll reveal that my area of expertise is the software security arm of their business, but I'll write on both areas. I don't want to write about the consulting arm, because bodyshop businesses don't scale well so I think that part is supplemental NOT their core business despite 30% revenue.

# Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and Electronic Design Automation

Synopsys main focus is on developing software for companies to build Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and integrated circuit designs. They help customers design and test chips. They also have pre-designed circuits for licensing as components of larger chips. In addition, they also provide hardware and software verification/validation services for electronic systems.

I'm not a hardware guru, but as far as I am aware this area is highly competitive. Cadence and Siemens are breathing down Synopsys' neck for getting revenue from circuit design software and I don't see a TRUE competitve advantage. BUT it is not my area of expertise, so I defer that to hardware folk.

That being said, as we move towards Decentralised Finance I expect a significant increase in interest in running purpose-built hardware as a means to achieve new business needs. Digital Currency, machine learning, cloud computing, video processing, or even future automotive/vehicle circuits require custom-built, reliable, secure, and performant hardware. Synopsys is able to deliver on all these.

Supply chain risks are now elevated across all industries due to coronavirus and increasingly troubled international relationships. I expect a large focus on managing this risk from nation states by increasing domestic chip fabrication and design where cost-effective to do so. This is to avoid getting locked out of emerging technology by being unable to access chips, should China improve military and commercial routes in the South-China Sea / threaten Taiwans autonomy.

In addition, TSM, AMD, Micron, and Nvidia have seen dramatic share-price uplifts over the last year and I expect a rising tide to lift all ships. Synopsys is quite undervalued in this space and as a Domestic US design shop, I expect to see more interest in their technology offerings.

# Software Integrity

Cyber is a growing industry with a huge total addressable market. Here, I have seen investments in well-known or larger players like Fireeye, Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Cloudflare go well for friends here. Happy to go into more detail about each of these offerings at a later date, but for now let's go with Synopsys as a relatively low-traded stock.

Synopsys' Software Integrity business looks for vulnerabilities in software applications and helps developers fix them, hopefully early and cheaply before they get released into a production environment.

Within the Application Security / DevSecOps space, security tools tend to fall into sveral categories. I can't write their acronyms without Automoderator hating me though. Synopsys does a few of those.

1. Static Analysis - Look at code, find bugs, report. Static Analysis tools function in different ways. Some build normalised syntax tree's (computer science nerd shit, basically think of it as a translation of a book written in 34 languages to 1 language). Others simply grep for known bad words (ctrl+F print each line with that word). There are many open-source versions like semgrep and bandit available as well.
2. Software Composition Analysis - Look at the libraries used in your software for known security issues and provide guidance for fixing those. Generally, composition analysis isn't difficult from a technical perspective, and numerous open source tools exist like OWASP Dependency Checker, nodepackagemanager audit, and so on.
3. Dynamic Analysis - Run your software, then throw shit at it and see what breaks. Useful for quickly identifying areas that crash your app, or ones that cause weird behaviour, but not as effective as a penetration test because they can't cover business logic well. Owasp zed attack proxy is a good example, as well as Community Burp Suite.

# Why not use Open Source?

Enterprises often cannot use open-source security tools due to regulatory concerns around the security OR quality of the tools. Other aspects include lack of support contracts, having to manage it internally, lack of integrations with other enterprise systems, etc. While I have no issue with open source security tools, boards and executives clearly do due to the lack of risk transferral and the advantage of shifting accountability to vendors (See SolarWinds).

# Synopsys Value Prop

Security Vendors focus on having a broad enterprise security offering (Gitlab) or on building high quality but niche security tools (Thinkst Canary, Splunk, Snyk). Synopsys is the former, but over last few years have acquired two of the latter and then integrated them into their enterprise offering.

In the Static Analysis space, there are a few large enterprise juggernauts like Checkmarx, Veracode, Microfocus Fortify, and Appscan as well some smaller players. The general industry feeling is that each of these is cost too much, don't work in new environments, and are generally security compliance tools trying to fit into a devops world.

Synopsys Coverity in comparison was built with more focus on the developer experience. Developer satisfaction and cost generally trump security coverage in the app-sec space, so these ancient security product companies are failing. To illustrate, $MFGA which owns Fortify (a fantastic product from 12 years ago) currently has a 20% dividend at the moment. Not sure how they'll grow their share price or get further investment with a 20% div.

Unfortunately for Synopsys, with most enterprise security products, a stupid long contract has been signed w/ prior static analysis vendors mostly to keep Microfocus in business I guess. There are plenty of legacy static analysis deployments currently rotting in big enterprises so the total addressable market for Coverity is massive. This is assuming they are able to meet enterprise chief information security officers on the golf course.

# Technical Competitive Advantages:

* Broad programming language support
* Lack of mandatory compilation / builds reduces analysis time
* Incremental analysis means you don't need to compile the whole application every time you want to run a scan. 
* Direct integration into integrated development environments helps developers find issues before committing code.
* Lower false positive ratio, less noise is better for developer experience

Sometimes, people think adding features, more vulns types, extra integrations, etc makes for a more convincing product. I think that coverity, by simply being simpler with a  focus on the developer experience will win a lot of product bake-offs compared to competitors.

Another thing to note, these are long term recurring revenue licensing agreements. You won't get immediate bang for buck from these contracts, they are generally paid Month to Month and because of that, Synopsys has to wait for their coffers to fill over time.

# Blackduck composition analysis

Blackduck basically works the same as other composition analysis vendors, although there is a lot more competition now with WhiteSource and Snyk becoming increasingly active in their Developer user experience space. They were best in breed, but I can't confidently say that's true any more.

Composition Analysis is huge in the security world, validating the integrity and automatically reporting (and potentially fixing) supply-chain risks has a huge TAM. Software Engineers pull libraries from anywhere into their software application instead of writing the code themselves, inheriting the risk profile of that library AND the risk of it being maliciously modified. Blackduck addresses this by identifying software with weaknesses quickly, providing guidance, and by providing vulnerability research into potential malicious updates to packages. 

I'm super bullish on all Composition Analysis products as I don't see Software Engineering moving in any direction except for additional code re-use over re-inventing the wheel.

BONUS: Another vendor in this space I'd consider to be promising would be JFrog for the same reasons as Synopsys Blackduck with the JFrog Artifactory Xray offering providing a similar service.

# Summary

\- Synopsys does two things, Chips and Software Security.

\- Synopsys according to their Jan21 Q4 report has been getting increasing revenue across both their Chip and Integriy business divisions despite supply chain disruptions and the covid pandemic.

\- Chips and manufacturing are a huge booming business, a rising tide lifts all ships.

\- Cybersecurity has a large total addressable market. Synopsys focusses on software security and made two large acquisitions over last 3 years. Both are high quality products with a focus on user experience and are now fully integrated into the holistic Synopsys enterprise offering.

\- Synopsys has been doing share buybacks over the last few years, which at least indicates to me confidence in their cashflow and longterm prospects.

\- Assets have improved Q32019 $6.4m to Q12020 $7.3m while liabilities Q32019 $2.3m to Q12020 $3.0m. Revenue slight improvement, Q12019 830k > Q12020 860k DESPITE global pandemic disrupting entire world.

Bearish Factors:

\- High customer acquisition cost, Synopsys mainly targets whale enterprises, so banking/governemnt/military/etc.

\- Acquihired talent lockup ends 2022 for Coverity and 2023 for Blackduck, will see if they stick around.

\- One of their Principal Sales Engineers told me I was a good kid and bought me a coke instead of whiskey at a networking event. Boomers in sales positions :(

**TL:DR Positions:** Synopsys does  chips and software security. Chip companies are mooning. Cyber is mooning. Why not both?

EDIT: I have removed almost every acronym as I think automoderator hates them. Sorry for the lengthy post because of that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Been a hell of a start to 2021. Thanks WSB _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Anatomy of a Coming Disaster. Hi.

Some of you know me, some of you don't.  If you DO, I ask that you not shill for me in the comments below, so we can stay within the rules of this sub.

This post is for the newbies, it is written as such, if you already know what delta hedging is, this post isn't for you.  If you *don't*, well, lads and lasses, this is for you.

We need to understand a few basic things here, and in keeping with the spirit of this post, we're going to keep it dead simple.

Market Makers (the big dogs behind the scenes, facilitating your yolos) DO NOT CARE if your options plays pay out for you.  They would be crazy to take on the level of risk that selling you an unhedged call or put would represent.  These guys make money in other ways.  So how can they not care?  Simple, they hedge.  Generally speaking, they buy enough shares when you buy a call so that even if you win hugely, they simply sell the shares they bought when you bought the call, and remain risk neutral.  (Edit, I've been asked to explain that market makers make money by recouping the difference between the bid/ask spread.  While this seems small, they do a LOT of it.)

Why does this matter?

Well, it matters because it introduces *leverage*.  Which simply means it amplifies the effect your money has on the stock market.  

As an example of how this works lets makes up a company.  We'll call the ticker ABC.  And we'll say the share price is 10 bucks.   You, as a degenerate yolo artiste, only have 100 bucks to play with, and you think ABC is going to the mewn.  

Now, you could do the boomer thing and just buy 10 shares of ABC (we'll call this scenario A), but a lifetime of minimum wage and renting a closet for 5k a month has done strange things to your risk management, so you decide to buy calls instead.  You go to whatever broker isn't fucking robinhood and take a look at your options - and there you see it.  For that SAME 100 bucks you can buy ten calls and leverage a hell of a lot more shares.   (We'll call this scenario B) So you do it, you buy the calls.

How does your choice effect the underlying stock?

In scenario A, you bought ten shares, you increased demand for the stock by 10 shares, and this does almost but not exactly nothing to the price.

In scenario B, you bought 10 calls, you made Mr. MM buy a lot of shares to hedge your bet, and you increased the demand for the stock by a much larger number of shares.  (This is an over simplification, but that's what we do here) Which does *something* to the share price.  Even if it's pretty small.
(Edit, as I said, this was an over simplification but I've been asked to address it.  Market makers use a number of metrics to determine how many shares they need to hedge your bet.  It is a lot, but it is almost never 100 times your call options)

Now, if you're part of the "We like ABC stock" gang, and 20 thousand of you buy 10 calls... Well, I forgot my calculator, but suffice to say you've just invited market makers to buy a FUCK TON of shares.  Just this, without any actual change in earnings, outlook, of fundamentals on ABC, puts tremendous bullish pressure on the stock *for the term of the option*

And THAT my friends, is the market we find ourselves in.  Talking heads on the news continue to talk about how "CraZy thE p/E raTiOs haVe bEcomE!!!"  Without mentioning what is actually driving this phenomenon.

Its options.  Specifically since March.  

So with that I'll tell you something pretty goddamn spectacular.  The stock market has become a *derivative* of the options market.  Earnings don't matter, fundamentals don't matter, past performance doesn't matter. The OPTIONS matter. 

This has happened before, in a very different way.  You know how there was a lot of noise in 08 about all the housing derivatives?  We're there again, except for instead of CDOs it's happening with with the shares of the biggest companies in the world.

Want proof?  Go look at 10 day spy chart, right now.  Then go look at a GME chart.  Look what happens to spy, tick for tick, as GME rises and falls. When the entire options meme market is focused on one ticker.

So what do we do about it?  Nobody knows.  I do know this, GME was only the *beginning*.  Retail knows it has the bull by the tail now.  What happens when the stock market becomes a lagging indicator of the sentiment of retail bull chads?

I don't know, but it's going to be *spectacular*.

Edit, much of the thinking around this post comes from months of conversation with a friend of mine.  She's pointed out since I posted this that she has written this up in a way 10 of us will understand in her latest blog post - which can be found here: https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/options-degenerate-marketplaces-part-1-b0ddf1c96fa6_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'm feeling the need to point out the difference between covering and closing a short position. Edit: What I describe below is called hedging. Covering and closing a short position are the same thing. Sorry for my mistake.

~~**Covering** short positions does not equal **closing** short positions. Everyone doing math trying to prove that GME short positions couldn't have been "covered" seems to ignore, overlook, or not realize the difference. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts and long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months, eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.

Edit: I am long GME and diamond-hand holding while I dollar cost average down and get ready for the long haul. This is just good info for everyone to have, not fodder for the 🌈🐻 hype train._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For all my diamond hands out there, this one's for you 💎🙌💎 &#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2cbzawjdczf61.gif

Losing money always sucks. As much as we joke about it, I know how terrible it feels. Bought GME and AMC near their highs like a true autist. Current loss (unrealized) is relatively tame for me, which speaks to just how much I've fucked up this past year. So I thought I'd make something **wholesome** for all my diamond hands out there. **Full 3 min video meme** of Sam's Speech from LOTR is here (WSB doesn't let me embed the full video in the post): [https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if\_frodos\_still\_in\_im\_still\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if_frodos_still_in_im_still_in/)

Honestly, the original speech does more justice than my captions. If Sam's words don't give you both life and make you weep as if you bought $800 OTM GME weeklies on Monday, then I'm not sure what will. Let me ask you, did Frodo let Sauron (Melvin in our case) get the one ring (our GME shares)? Ok, maybe he came close, but that's why he had his **gay diamond balled boyfriend Sam** with him to help him stay strong. Don't forget, you've got thousands (perhaps many more) of fellow Sams **holding the line** with you 💎🙌💎. **Don't give in now.**

We've gone through hell and back again, but the journeys not over yet. **We still gotta carry GME all the way to fucking Mordor.** Only then will we see the **mother** of all short squeezes, and all that's green and good in this world will be ours once again.

I know all you apes are experiencing market withdrawal this weekend, but hope you're relaxing. Watch some Lord of the Rings. It'll make you feel better.

Positions: 12 shares GME @ $346.94, 468 shares AMC @ $12.43. Not much compared to some, but it's all I could afford. Please come back for me. Yes I know I bought near the peak.

# These are just general findings, so chill the fuck out!

&#x200B;

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA, Jan29th text file ( [http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt)) Feb 5th text file ([http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\"short exempts\\"\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-"The screaming cries of wallstreetbets"

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual "Retail Investors" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?----->NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The "big bois" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

[Figure 7: Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME](https://preview.redd.it/dzjkv3zqlyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b68bc546184bc5e079101a4c9d9d66b1955365)

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, "Retail Investors" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

So Clover Health, they use machine learning to personalize the Medicare experience for each specific patient to lower healthcare costs through improved decision making. Their growth is tied to virtuous cycles (positive feedback loops) by using improving machine learning to continuously lower costs over time. Currently CLOV annual growth rate is 38%. Hindenburg recently released a negative report on the company that brought down the stock price 15% in the past few days, but it’s started to turn around Friday. It’s down from it’s all time high of $17.45. Could be a good buying opportunity.

Anyone who knows more about the company have any further insight? I got in on the dip on Friday. 

Positions: 100 shares @ 11.78 ; 10 12/17 $12.5 calls

TLDR: talk about things other than GME. CLOV seems like it’s in a position for positive growth and could be a good play to buy the dip on.

EDIT: Apparently the smooth brains are out in force downvoting me because they can’t see the future through their own 🦍 shit smeared eyes and hands. So let me break it down for you like you’re 5 years old.

Kenny at the playground sold you 100 popsicle sticks at a markup of 10x for your school craft project because he stole them all from art supply closet..... no one likes Kenny. So you say hey you know what.... I’m gonna take these 100 popsicles and cut them all in half and now you have 200 popsicles and you resell them to Jennifer who really needs to get an A in class. Except Jennifer goes out and buys her own popsicles from store..... and the stores are saying they have at least 900 popsicles ready to go.... so Jennifer says I want 300.... but now the stores say hey.... we really only had 100 and Kenny just bought the last 100.... so now the popsicles are all
Gone! 

NO ONE HAS POPSICLES. So now Kenny can go sell them for as much as he wants because supply States so. 

In summary it takes us to buy the popsicles(physical silver) first in order to reveal behind the curtain that the stores (banks) don’t actually have as many popsicles as they say they do... therefore $SLV squooozeeees and we are all happy_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Deep Value Prospect that always beats earnings. &#x200B;

 **Summary**

* Company represents an excellent deep value prospect for long-term investors.
* The company has an excellent operating history but was slammed by the current downturn.
* Leverage is not unreasonable and once the company turns around, it will offer strong upside prospects.
* New fad of collecting Pops!
* Shares rallied \~25% in the aftermath of reporting third-quarter results.
* This is due to a broad earnings beat in Q3 alongside a general recovery in the markets for names tethered to economic recovery.
* It's impact from the pandemic bottomed out in Q2, and though revenue is expected to be negative through Q4, Wall Street expects a return to growth next year.
* Company trades at only \~15x next year's EPS estimates and \~8x the earnings it generated in FY19.

This company is an iconic modern-day toy company. Despite its status as a fast-growing, quality firm at the height (so far) of its popularity, the company has been slammed by fears related to retail shutdowns. Investors have panicked about deserted malls and sent shares of the firm spiraling down in recent months. Near-term pain is over and the company’s prospects improving, now might be a good time to jump in and consider buying up a piece of the enterprise on the cheap.

**A great operating history**

Operating history of this company has been, over time, really impressive. Take, for instance, the case of revenue. Between 2017 and 2019, sales at the firm grew 54.1% from $516.08 million to $795.12 million. As sales at the company grew, the company’s profits improved as well. Back in 2017, the company’s net income totaled just $3.94 million. By 2019, net profit had grown to $11.73 million. Before we move on to other metrics, the firm’s net profit does warrant some discussion. Despite the company’s strong brand name, it has been unable to capitalize on it in the way that can generate attractive margin. Even in 2019, its best year on record, the company’s net profit margin was 1.5%. It’s a positive that this trend has been improving, but until margins grow substantially from here, the company is at risk of a bad year really hurting it.

While bottom line wasn't great during shut downs, its other operating metrics are attractive. Operating cash flow, for instance, totaled $90.77 million. This was more than triple the $23.84 million in operating cash flow seen two years earlier. Even compared to 2018, this metric is up 81.6%. This works out to an operating cash flow margin for 2019 of 11.4%. Another important metric, Adjusted EBITDA, has also done well. Back in 2017, this metric totaled $90.03 million. This grew 36.7% to $123.04 million by 2019. This margin works out to 15.5% for 2019.

**It might be time to jump on board**

There’s no doubt that it is being hit at the moment, but it’s important to keep the eye on the long-term outlook. Though management has provided no long-term guidance for the business, its operating history prior to the pandemic suggests that its future will continue to be bright once the crisis is past.

If we use metrics from 2019, its price/earnings ratio of 17 looks quite high. Its price/operating cash flow multiple, though, is far lower at 2.20. Its EV/EBITDA multiple on that basis is also low at 2.94. This makes the company a clear deep-value prospect. Even if we annualize the firm’s first quarter EBITDA, its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is still quite reasonable at 7.60, which means that **it is cheap** now if we assumed that the future of the business would look a lot more like this year is likely to look.

**Takeaway**

Based on the data provided, it’s clear to me that this company presents investors with some very attractive prospects at the moment. The company has a nice operating history. Its cash flows are particularly attractive. Right now, the business is being hurt by the global pandemic just like most firms across most industries, but once this pain passes, the upside from here could be quite significant. **It is a great reopening investment and also great play on collectable fad that staying at home has ushered.**

These "gainz"posts are becoming more and more common from last couple of days indirectly telling people that the squeeze happened and they all made profits bla bla (few genuine people  made profits -not the rest scammy ones.!)

And yes, it "seems" there won't be a 2nd squeeze (I don't believe it though) if you search anywhere on YouTube or even reddit . 

I have reasons to believe it will or else we won't have so much manipulative shit going around.


I mean same graphs for AME and GMC for 5 straight days?
Increasing "gain-porn" in the week or biggest losses ?
Media telling us it's over and treating it like history ?


Yeah well I am buying tomorrow . Maybe it is over maybe it's not .

Take care and enjoy your Sunday you ugly ass DIAMOND hands apes !_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If GME gain porn is cool again, then I'll share mine. $3.1M in 19 days. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lemming: a disparaging term for an investor who exhibits herd mentality and invests without doing their own research, which often leads to losses. Ok guys and gals, one of the greatest strengths of this community is that there are always people who are willing to check your work, give a different perspective, alert you something you may have missed, or poke holes in your DD.

Now there are millions upon millions of us, with our collective knowledge and experience this should make us one of the greatest forces on the planet right?

If we continue to berate and downvote everyone who has a dissenting opinion, we will not succeed. You will collectively run off a financial cliff, while those of us who do know what they are doing will empty the pockets of your dead bodies.

I encourage everyone to learn as much as possible, understand what the folks that post DD are saying, ask questions and contribute to this community for everyone’s success.

Not everyone is a bot, or out to get you and it is ok if they have a different point of view than you. GME has spoiled us, stocks are never this easy but they could be if we used our collective knowledge and experience.

[Lemming Effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lemming.asp)

TLDR: Don’t be a Lemming, dissenting opinions are ok, learn while you are here, I am not a bot, and I don’t work for a hedge fund.

GME 25 @$59.50_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Food for Thought  

I wanted to take a time-out and lay out some of my thoughts on everything that has happened in the last few weeks. This was always about seeing the VALUE in the future of the company, and making a play on that value. Yes it was shorted an extreme amount and we saw the potential in the short squeeze as well. There were many excellent DD's written about both the company and the potential for the short squeeze along with possible scenario's for this. I personally didn't think we would see any drastic change in price until after Q4 ER, but look at where we are now.

With that being said, I want to focus on several things that have happened over the course of January, how it impacted us, and why this is still continuing today. I will start with January 12th, as this is when things started to get interesting.

Jan 12th:

GME closes around $20.

Jan 13th:

GME opens around $28

GME closes around $31

Jan 14th:

GME opens around $35

GME closes around $40

From January 14th to close of January 21st, GME trades sideways between $35-$45. Later that evening on January 21st, something crazy happened....

WSB was taken down, and a picture was put up that said DoJ, FBI, ICE, and Europool had seized this "hidden site". Like what? Its a public forum.... ok, anyways. WSB is down for an hour or two, and when it comes back up, there's a VERY interesting post from a guy that says there are much bigger players involved in this, a shitstorm is brewing, and he has proof that the mods have verified. The top comment is from a mod that said he had verified OP's sources. I barely got to read through the post once along with the mods comment before Reddit kicked me out and the app reset on my phone. Boom, post is gone, and a few people mention seeing it and wondering wtf that was all about. Now we get to January 22nd, a Friday.

January 22nd:

GME opens at $47

GME closes around $64

Most if not call options are ITM. Gamma squeeze time. Hype had started to creep in during the weekend. We open Monday like this:

January 25th:

GME opens around $117

GME closes around $76

At some point during this week, I don't remember exactly which day, the media started attacking us. Bots started to fill up our beloved subreddit, and our lines of communication were hurt while we sorted through the bullshit.

January 26th:

GME opens around $87

GME closes around $150

January 27th:

GME opens around $370

GME closes around $350

January 28th:

GME hits above $500 in premarket.

Before markets officially open, RH and other brokers decide to block all buying, and allow only selling. Fidelity and a few others did not participate in this, the majority did.

GME closes around $200

January 29th:

GME opens around $330

GME closes above $320

When GME closed above $320, most calls were ITM (cant remember if we had $800c options yet). Lots of media saying the squeeze already happened, bot attacks, media saying we are pumping SLV (wut? lol) or random biotech companies, and negative posts from bots / whoever the fuck else.

February 1st:

GME opens around $240

GME closes around $220

I don't think I need to recap the next couple of days for you, it is burned into our minds, but several important things happened. DFV was called to testify on the 19th of February in front of the House Financial Services Committee. On Wednesday our sub was compromised and tons of negative sentiment flooded in, a lot of new members posting the diamond hand spam, etc. Our sub is most likely still compromised, and we don't know when we will have it back.

So lets highlight what they have done so far:

1. Discredit DFV in the media, and call him to testify.

2. Break our lines of communication by compromising our subreddit.

3. Sow doubt and fear amongst us with the flood of bots and negative sentiment. We have suspect accounts posting gain porn from GME, downvoting or telling people to sell, and spamming the sub with other bullshit.

4. Restricting demand of stock while it is flooded with supply. This wasn't lifted until Friday, in which we saw our first green day of the week. (**FUCK ROBINHOOD IN PARTICULAR!** We don't care if you want to blame it on the DTCC, you caved in, plus, where did that 3bn in additional capital come from you managed to raise by Thursday?)

5. Paper Portnoy getting his million followers to jump in and subsequently sell for a loss. I truly wouldn't be surprised if this was a ploy by the men up top to pump and dump the stock and scare everyone into selling.

6. 4 days of red before restrictions are removed and demand catches back up to supply (price dropping increases demand also via opportunity cost). Keep in mind, a lot of people were transferring holdings over to new brokers and had money tied up until Friday, when we see our first green day.

Let me be crystal clear here, if they have to tell us we have lost, yet still attack us, then we haven't lost. There is a LOT more going on here than just retail vs hedge funds. This is not over, and the big players know it. Most of us here from the beginning are here to see it to the end, as it was always about the future value of the company. To our brothers who bought at the top and are still holding, we are coming. It may not be next week, it may not even be in the next few months (I'm still eyeing Q4 ER), but we are coming. I don't care if you think the stock is overvalued at $66.50. I don't give a fuck if you sold for a loss. You don't realize any gains or losses until you sell. Buy the dip and average down retard. I will be holding because I can afford to hold, and I believe in the future of this company. I am not a financial professional, just a smooth brained retard. I do hold positions in GME and have been in since $14.

This is not financial advice, just sharing my thoughts.

On February 9th the official short interest % will be released, with all the short sellers having to report about their short positions to FINRA. *Correct me if I'm wrong*, but I'm pretty sure the short sellers CAN and WILL lie (not surprising after all they've done) and the worst thing that will happen is to them is - you guessed it - a fine that'd be dwarfed by their gains if people believed the damn number.

So don't be spooked if short interest data looks off/too low on the 9th. Posting this as a lot of people say this will be the 'make or break' info. They'll fuckin lie

Now some people say there is something fishy going on and the mods are still compromised.

However I would want to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe GME is still so huge that no one wants to make good DDs or alternatively there actually aren't any good DDs except for people trying to push penny stocks. In any case there have only been 3-4 DD posts over the past 48h.

@Mods: this is supposed to generate transparency if it gets traction. If good DDs are thrown out due to a spam of Pennystocks or stronger enforcement of rules, then we can easily assess this here and it gives the community a transparent view on the DD situation.

On   Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow  the same exact pattern.  While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

GME   is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling   down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive,   and there's more volume to play around with.

Yahoo   Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as "Neutral" despite the amount   of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the   performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term.    People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is   neither stock dead in the water yet?  Why do both stocks show more   resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People   shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money   on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily.  Everyone is waiting   until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate   those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily   shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business   before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can   make "easy money".

Consensus:   Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and   definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday   than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum  that  GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME  because  they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike  wasn't  relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point,  AMC's  shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype).  If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

$AMC._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trading for 4 months now, this sub has changed my life. Thank you RC 😘 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You Are Here _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 💎🙏 ape gang!! No seriously it’s time to get over it. Everyone who’s been here longer than two weeks is tired of the posts about who’s still holding, trying to predict the daily movements and for the love of god the absolute NONSENSE conspiracies.

Stop living in denial for two fucking seconds and listen. The ONLY reason GME got as high as it did was because of the media. It was portrayed as a “David vs Goliath” story which started a buying frenzy that everyone wanted to be a part of. I know you dipshits don’t understand how the stock market works but I’m sure you can understand simple supply and demand. 

Look at the chart. You can literally see the day it became national news, and like most things, it was viral for a few days followed by NO ONE GIVING A SHIT EVER AGAIN.

So that’s it. Here we are with GME back to reasonable volume, backpedaling it’s way to a more reasonable value. If you have shares you have two choices, hold because you think the return from this point will be stronger than other investments, or sell because you think it won’t. What you paid for the shares has absolutely nothing to do with it. “Diamond hands” isn’t a admirable ballsy move it’s idiot speak for “I’m too scared and dumb to determine if I was wrong and need to move on”.

If you do hold, you need to realize it will be a while. You need to stop constantly checking the price, stop telling yourself you will wake up tomorrow and see it at +100%, stop coming on here looking to confirm your beliefs. Find something else to do to occupy your time before you lose your mind.

This is not the first time this sub has bum rushed a stock after its hit multiple ATHs only for it to come crashing back down, and it won’t be the last. It’s over._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My fellow autists... Palantir ($PLTR) has arrived. **February 19th** is when the lockup expires for Palantir.

Are you ready to buy the dip on the next company we get to tell our grandkids about?

February 16th is their earnings report. Which they most likely are going to blow out of the park. Granted this goes well; we look at February 19th when the lockup expires. Do insiders sell at all time highs? Most likely to unload some of it and pay themselves. This is a BTFD opportunity on a company that has potential. They're rare and only visit us once in a while.

Edit: This is by no means financial advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Abcellera- 02/12 Earnings and Potential Against Competitors Hey everyone,

This will most likely get deleted due to my account not having enough to karma. I just wanted to start a discussion regarding Abcellera. In my opinion the Peter Thiel backed company is extremely interesting and has a potential for large-ish revenue in the future due to royalties. 

However, at the moment the company has extreme disparity between market cap and revenue that makes me somewhat uncomfortable. Especially in comparison to its competitors like CERT.

What is everyone’s thoughts on this?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Listen, Disney is going to the moon! Read why my fellow WSB YOLOers! Made the biggest due diligence today - Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)

Firstly, Disney is a strong competitor to Netflix with their streaming service, Disney+. Since its release they have pumped subscription numbers that only Netflix could dream about. Disney is not only trying to increase their revenues through blockbuster movies, but also by dragging new viewers to flagship series such as 'The Mandalorian' and more recently, 'WandaVision'. On top of this they are planning to produce more Marvel series (they own Marvel Studios daah...). These series will most likely be starring big boi action figures such as Electro, Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, Doctor Strange and Thor. I don't know shit about these characters since I could care less about The Avengers (all I care about is stonks).

Secondly, Disney will rocket to Pluto when the Pandemic is over and they open up their amusement parks. All kids and/or your wives kids (from another boyfriend/husband) will beg their parents to ride Mickey Mouse's Roller Coaster and Disney is going to pump the revenues like they never have before. Do you remember when when you were a kid and always begged your parents for stuff? Well that is going to happen with both Disney+ and their amusement parks. Kids will cry till their parents take them there.

Thirdly, invest on your own risk. This is only food for thought! I will give you some more spicy investment advise should I be successful. No Profit & Loss, Balance sheet and Cash Flow stuff here, just pure future prospects, a.k.a. YOLO.

Disney earnings 11 February. Good luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some GME gains _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trash _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wallstreetbets mod Twitter account no longer verified _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Melvin still shorting GME? Hey guys just want you all to check my smooth brain math and tell me what you think.

My understanding is that Melvin Capital held a short position of approximately 40% of GME shares, or approximately 38M shares.

E: 38M is a worse than worst case number 40% would be approx 28M. Also I don't even know where 40% comes from I've just seen it around reddit a bunch. It's probably much higher than reality.

Melvin reported losses of approximately $6B in January well before the share hit $300 and claimed to be out of their position on the ~~22nd~~ 26th when the shares were worth approximately ~~$50~~ $150. But for the worse than worst possible case scenario let's use $300 share price and see if the numbers add up.

https://www.tradingdirect.com/pricing/Interest-Rates#:~:text=The%20formula%20for%20the%20interest,Corp%20at%20%2425%20per%20share.

>The formula for the interest calculation will be: (Market Value x Rate x # of days) / 360.

I have seen the rates for GME reported at an insanely high 10%, let's assume worse than worst case scenario and and call that 15%.

Let's also not worry about complicated integrals and assume the price was $300 every day of january.

So, ($300 * .15 * 30) / 360 * 38,000,000 = $142,500,000

Last time I checked $142.5M is a whole lot less than 6B using every possible worse than worst case scenario. Seems like their losses were probably incurred exiting their short position.

I'm pretty uninformed, what am I missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $gme 🦍💎👐🚀 lick my 🥜🌈🐻 I'm enjoying the memes, I yolo'd 50k and wound up with 450 shares at about 116.00 pps.

You know, there are fagts who simply play calls and puts all day... So ask who's playing, are they selling the puts...And/or... Are they playing the calls?

To the actual shareholders, we have control because we own the stock and it is about our patience, but other actors(🌈🐻 and put players) are attacking holders psychologically.

If Cuban, Elon, Chamath, Ryan, and Burry are the biggest owners  collectively, OR EVEN big hedges, they can force options "in the money," 

This will force shorts to cover big time. Short interest players will get fukt, while the professionals hold and squeeze the price per share up to a point where shorting can't even work. The sharks are here, so tread with some smooth brain.

For me, I'm just a retarded ape looking for easy money through volatility. I can't thank the #gmegang enough for their carbon hands. As for me. 50k hit or miss. 💎👐🦍 Are forever until the squeeze is squoze.

So the Canadian stock Green Thumb Industries Inc. Which trades under the symbol GTII on the Toronto stock exchange has gotten a lot of attention lately due to legal weed. Well that stock trades as GTBIF on U.S. exchanges in U.S. dollars. The U.S. Stock GTII is a dirt cheap penny stock that is Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. Well, when I was looking to buy Green Thumb a few days ago I accidentally found myself looking at Global Tech...Which led me to wonder how many others might make this mistake. It turns out a LOT of people. Now what happens when volume spikes massively on a gently shorted over time penny stock? Well the short at first doubles  up thinking it's free money.

 However, when you get multiple days of spiking volume the short probably starts to panic. Imagine you've shorted millions of shares of a podunk stock with 50K a day volume and suddenly people are buying it up? You're going to burn.

I've been watching this. I got in at $0.24...and then got out thinking it was over...But no, I got back IN for bigger and more! So Friday it closes up 115% at $0.86 with over 2,000,000 shares traded.

I seen on the box, the bird, and the printz  that LGND was part of the WSB squeeze however other then a few post that seemed largely exaggerated. Even if it’s an industry plant it seems like a good play, maybe even a a lay up for a short term grab. Probably some value in a long term play also. 

The play 
LGND has been buying back shares for the last 3 years. Reducing total shares from 21 mil to 16 mil. Average price paid per share on the buyback was $105. The shorts are already 62% of the float which is second to GME.  However, it appears that as much 9 mil shares are owned by insiders. 5 mil shares are actually owned by Investment 10 llc since 2014. Investment 10 appears to not be very active with only a handful of sec fillings mostly signed by a management fund. This LLC being largely inactive, I believe suggests that it belongs to one of the head insiders. This is big because 30% of the float is likely owned by someone who rarely trades shares- by their filings. The 5 mil plus the other insiders is near 9 mil insider ownership. 

16 mil float - 9 mil insider shares= 7 million available 
10.01 M shorted (62% of 16 mil)
21 days to cover 
*Average volume 1 mil shares 


Catalyst 
LGND beat earnings and shares jumped up $22 dollars on Friday— the risk of a squeeze is more and more likely with any significant push in volume.

Background info 
If hedgies ran a pharmacy. Ligand began as a biopharmaceutical company and failed then reinvented itself as a pharmacy  investment bank and also happens to be run - to some degree by investment bankers. The company acquires early-stage drug technology, and then licenses it in a tiered royalty fee. Some of it clients uses it license while creating more early stage drug technology. Perpetual motion, I guess. For instance it’s licensing agreement some companies are not even yet profitable such as Seelos- a penny stock with 50% insider ownership that has jumped $1.94 in the last month despite recent dilution in same month and large debt- is for a mid stage parkisons treatment. 
-over $700 million in cash, Ligand is position to acquire more drugs.
-Captisol sales were $41 million compared with $7.1 million a year ago. 
-Captisol is used Veklury (remdesivir), which is approved for treating severe COVID-19 patients 

Something about this all smells fishy but profitable. I’m trusting the crooks to bring me the tendies. Smells like free money.

I’ve spent some time grieving my losses and want to make sure normies with diamond hands know what they’re getting into. In the simplest terms:

Reasons why GME rocket engines will fail:

- Another gamma squeeze is very unlikely. $800 OTM calls exist for hedging. Also, this thread explains the conditions of a gamma squeeze for apes. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/

- Short sale restrictions lift on Monday. Expect more dips until GME stabilizes at market worth.

- If short interest is still >100%, that doesn’t mean that GME will squeeze. Shorts have been short at >100% for months and the conditions for rocket launches are no longer attainable.

- Robinhood and other brokers messed up, but it’s unlikely anything will change. The reasons they gave on why they limited GME, AMc, and meme stocks are enough to appease the SEC.

- The ITM calls that expired eod Friday will not cause a gamma squeeze

- Most folks who are deep in the red are experiencing internal struggles and facing the prisoner’s dilemma, will cash out at break even, and that’s ok

Wildcards:

- If institutional share owners decided to diamond hand GME like Porsche did Volkswagen, GME would reach Pluto

- which brings up the question, why do they own >100% of available shares?

- FTDs, if they are ever investigated, would probably make something happen

- don’t know the validity of this, but apparently an emergency shareholder meeting would force all shares to be called, also forcing shorts to cover. This sounds like fake news tbh so idk.

All in all, I’m just a retard, this is not financial advice

My position: 

115 shares avg @ $403

Down almost $35k

**edit1: forgot to add, I’m diamond hands on GME, a true re t a r d hoping for a cosmic event to unleash the Squeeze of legends.
