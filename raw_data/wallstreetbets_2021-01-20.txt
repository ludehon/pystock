"Fore" real doh, this is gonna takeoff.  The merger of these two companies is mutually beneficial in so many ways.  For one, it lowers the costs of equipment for Topgolf.  Callaway benefits by new golfers being brought into the sport by Topgolf.  It's like going to a bowling alley, far less daunting than scheduling a tee time and being worried about etiquette and other elitist BS at the local country club.  People can get the hang of the sport, without diving into the deep end.  In turn, new folks get exposure to Callaway products as you have to assume every Topgolf becomes a Callaway retailer going forward.  On top of all this, Topgolf's TopTracer tech can be licensed out and has still barely penetrated the market.

Last but not least, the pandemic and it's infinite boredom has positively impacted the sport bringing new people in, and experienced folks out more often just to get out of the house.  I'm sure WFH and the ability to sneak out undetected to play a round hasn't hurt either.

Positions: 2/19 $30c and Shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'm doing my part. BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now "short gamma", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a "gamma ramp" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a "gamma squeeze" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than "on bottom" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the "on top" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance:  Moderate to "almost moderate". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long term holder of TSLA shares **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

This half million is the product of continually rolling \~$4000 worth of initial SPWR options contracts purchased in late July, and then selling some and exercising 100 of them at the beginning of January. I'll post my full gain porn when my portfolio hits $1 million.

EDIT: Public service announcement, if you're going to play options on SPWR, pleeeeeease do NOT play weeklies. It's a heavily shorted, manipulated stock, and it has a habit of killing weekly options players even while maintaining this incredible long-term march upwards. Be smart, buy 3-6 months out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ These MITT yearly calls are absurd and just a good buy in general. Yes, I know MITT is in a bit of trouble. However, they’ve been sitting quietly down 80% because of COVID, and besides a single day at about 7$, have stayed in that range. This stock ranges from 3 to 4 dollars a share consistently right now, with only waiting on a single bit of good news to get its recovery going. Yes it’s a mortgage trust company, but before COVID hit, it was consistently a household stock at 18$ a share. Do you know what the calls are going for? I just bought 10 calls at fucking 0.70 **For January 21 2022** at a strike price of 3.00.

The stock is sitting at **2 fucking 95** l. These assholes are betting 70 bucks that a stock won’t increase 30% **in a full year** when one piece of good news or hype could potentially list this shit at 8 fucking dollars like nothing. Fuck, I just convinced myself to go buy another 5 calls at open. This company is admittedly not the best. But are you seriously telling me this stock won’t ever reach 3.70 when it was listed at 18 dollars less than a year ago? MITT is not going bankrupt, for fucks sake. The stock was at 3.50 LAST MONTH.

TL,DR; Long calls on MITT are free 🌚 tickets, people just don’t realize it yet_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CVS 100c 1/20/33 - All Aboard 🚂🚂 EDIT* 100c 1/20/23 

CVS Health is a pharmacy retailer with about 10,000 stores and CVS Caremark is also one of the big pharmacy benefit managers in the United States. Due to the acquisition of Aetna, CVS is now also one of the major players in the health care insurance market. The stock hit its all-time highs in 2015 and is in a downtrend since then. At this point, the stock is still trading 33% below its former highs. And although the stock is trading already about 50% above its 2019 and 2020 lows, the stock is still extremely cheap and the stock price doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the business. While the stock has been declining in the last five years, CVS could increase its revenue 60% (also due to the Aetna acquisition) and increase its earnings per share 40% in the meantime. Free cash flow is even 80% higher than in 2015.

Right now, CVS is trading for a P/E ratio of 12.6, which is extremely cheap compared to the market and many other companies. It is also cheap considering the growth rates the business could report in the recent past. Additionally, the stock is trading below the sector median as well as the company's own 5-year average. And even when using very conservative assumptions for a discount cash flow analysis, the intrinsic value for CVS should be at least $110 and therefore the stock is still trading about 30% below its intrinsic value.

CVS declined pretty steeply several times in the past: especially in the 1970s the stock crashed more than 80% and after the Dotcom bubble, the stock declined more than 60%. Hence, we cannot really describe the stock as a recession-proof pick, but the combination of a stock that is still trading way below its all-time high with a low double-digit P/E ratio and a fundamental business that definitely is recession-proof creates a good buying opportunity in my opinion._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NFLX $DIS $ROKU Streaming Services Comparison - Jan 20th _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you fuckers wanna actually make money for once? $CRM and $SRPT Are you tired of losing your hard earned money by buying the stupid FD’s that your wife’s boyfriend from r/thetagang sells? Well then you’re at the right spot. Lets get to talking. CRM and SRPT are currently undervalued. CRM initially dropped due to the slack acquisition back in December. Since then, its consolidated at these levels. Using my magic crayons and the Ichimoku clouds, it is obvious that CRM is ready to explode back to previous highs. SRPT dropped 50% due to a failed drug trial which only failed due to a rare occurrence and error in the experiment. On top of this, our bitch cathy been buying up shares and increased her position to 1.5 million shares. 

TLDR: buy CRM and SRPT

GAN is a backend technology provider for the mobile- and online-gambling industry. I think it will be the best performing stock of 2021. Although I am all in on GME until the MOASS, and then I am switching to GAN.

You likely remember that from 2012 to 2018, New Jersey fought a public court battle for its right to legalize sports betting. In May 2018, the Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of the state, giving birth to a multibillion-dollar industry virtually overnight.

Today, 19 states (and Washington, D.C.) have already begun allowing sports betting, and six more have legalized (but not yet implemented) it. Because each state is building its own framework, there are significant regulatory differences between them.

Complicating matters further, most states only issue sportsbook licenses to casinos and racetracks. This makes some sense, but the real benefits of sports betting come from mobile and online betting, not from people going to casinos.

As former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wrote in a 2019 opinion piece in the *Detroit News* (emphasis added)...

>What's to account for our success in New Jersey? New Jersey is the only state with full mobile access for sports fans and a robust competitive marketplace for gaming operators.We allow customers to conveniently register to bet on their phones and bet from anywhere in the state because we are aware of a simple reality: People do everything on their phones these days.

And the evidence backs this up... In the first year of New Jersey sports betting, 83% of bets came from online wagers. So how are the casinos and racetracks handling this new venture? By finding partners with experience running mobile and online gaming, like GAN.

GAN's software gives customers real-time control of all facets of online operations, including promotions, messaging, analytics, and processing bets and transactions. GAN's biggest customers are land-based casinos and racetracks. Notable customers include Penn National Gaming (PENN), Churchill Downs (CHDN), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), among many other casinos.

GAN is primarily a Software as a Service ("SaaS") business with two main sources of income...

1. Fees its customers pay for its technology suite and related services.
2. A variable cut of its customers' gaming revenues.

GAN also occasionally sees large, one-time lumps of revenue for licensing a casino loyalty patent it owns.

The market loves the "sticky" SaaS model because it brings in recurring revenue, meaning customers tend to renew year after year. SaaS companies also boast high margins and are capital efficient. Our expectation is that most, if not all, of GAN's major contracts will expand geographically as its customers continually move into newly legalized jurisdictions.

In November 2020, GAN announced an agreement to acquire a company that may have been the last missing piece of its offering. It's buying the parent company of European online gaming platform Coolbet for about $175 million. This gives GAN a "best-in-class sportsbook engine" – in other words, the people and technology to set lines, manage risk, and generally run a sportsbook.

With Coolbet, GAN will now be able to offer a full turnkey, managed sportsbook to its casino customers. This puts GAN's offering on equal footing with its major competitors from a product breadth and depth standpoint, and will also allow GAN to capture more and more wallet share from its customers.

Yes, we can profit if GAN is bought out by a deeper-pocketed customer, like a casino or burgeoning daily fantasy sports companies FanDuel or DraftKings (DKNG). But as with our other potential acquisition targets, the real opportunity would be for GAN to remain independent.

In a gold rush, a given prospector may or may not get rich... but a company selling "picks and shovels" will always prosper. GAN is a picks-and-shovels play on mobile betting. It's already realizing huge revenue growth, and less than half the country has even begun taking bets. As the rest of the U.S. wakes up to the tax and job-creation opportunities that legal sports betting offers, GAN will be among the first to profit.

It's quite clear to me and probably everyone here beforehand that this is really starting to pick up steam outside /r/wallstreetbets.

Most of you longer holders probably roll your eyes at the ever-increasing autistic and retarded comments and questions appearing in the daily thread like:

>i just bought at $44 when 2 sell?!?!?!?!

>gonna take out 10k margin to buy!!!  
>  
>omg i bought at the high and now its $36 im gonna selll!!!!  
>  
>too late to buy???!?!

# Oh boy...

Let's go through a beginners Q&A:

***WTF IS HAPPENING IM FROM*** /r/ALL ***PLS HELP I WANT MONEYYYYY*** 🤑🤑💰💰

I could fill up this entire thread with a long answer but here is a ***VERY MAJORLY*** dumbed down version for retards to understand:

* Gamestop (GME) is hated by big money companies, companies want GME to die
* Investors say: ***n o***
* GME has solid foundation, big money investors continue to buy stock
* GME catches on /r/wallstreetbets as a meme stock
* /r/wallstreetbets realize that GME is no meme stock at all
* [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), founder of multi-billion dollar company [Chewy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)), INVESTS HEAVILY into GME, then becomes a fucking BOARD MEMBER and brings his buddies in to save GME from dying
* everyone on /r/wallstreetbets has week-long erections and continues to pour money into GME up to this day

So **a lot** of people have been buying and **HOLDING** GME stock in hopes of the company's future prospects and/or a SHORT-SQUEEZE, [what is a short-squeeze?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM)

***TOO LATE 2 BUY???*** 🤔 🤔 🤔

Absolutely not, regardless if you're short-term (few days/weeks) or long-term (few months/years), it is looking like a pretty good time to jump in

***OMG IT DROPPED $4 I HAVE TO SELL!!!***   🌈🌈🌈

*Stop.*

If you're SPENDING MONEY on GME, you should understand it WILL HAVE BIG FLUCTUATIONS. If you're the type of person to write this comment, please educate yourself and [read this excellent analysis on the GME stock itself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/)

tldr: dont sell holy shit u fucking retard just hold💎🙌 and you have the potential of selling at ludicrous prices later

***IM GONNA TAKE OUT ROBINHOOD MARGIN TO BUY MORE HUEHUEHU IM GREEDY AF*** 😈😈😈

Shorters (big bad companies) can "borrow" your margin stock to climb themselves out of the real bad hole they're in. If you buy with cash, they **cannot.**

You are literally working against yourself and the entire community if you buy stocks on margin.

***OK DEN ILL DO OPTIONS???***

No. The only thing putting pressure on companies who are shorting are **SHARES.**

Again, you are hurting yourself and the cause if you buy anything but shares.

***WHEN IS SHORT SQUEEZE?!!? HOW DO I TIME IT???? PRICE TARGET??!?!?*** *🐑🐑🐑*

Nobody knows for sure. All we know is that companies that are shorting GME stock are losing **b i g m o n e y** as GME stock continues to stay this high, and they'll thwart and prevent it as best as they can before they eventually give in.

Historically, big short squeezes last anywhere from a full day to a full week. Please refer to the [VW Squeeze](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/) and/or the [TSLA Squeeze.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png) These things don't happen within a few minutes people, you have time.

Price targets in the short term are very tricky to pin down. [Here's a very well done analysis](https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf) of potential LONG-TERM estimates by our friend /u/Uberkikz11. As for short term squeeze price target? Most of the retard sentiment here is ***hoping*** for a squeeze anywhere from $300 to $1000, again very hard to pin down.

Alright, now that you're caught up to speed, let's go through some

I know, I know, autist together = stronk but let's not get *too* ahead of ourselves and pretend we can make GME blast off on a moments notice. We DO have power, just stop being mega-autistic about it.

**GME GONNA HIT $1000 LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND ITS GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW**

You know, I was leaning towards GME squeezing VW-esque for a fair bit as well [(although I was skeptical)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyn0nz/should_you_buy_gme_shortsqueezes_and_the/)

However I'm *really* convinced this is going to take a fair bit more time, weeks to months for anything resembling a squeeze. With more data coming in, GME really does seem like it's being set up for a [TSLA-esque squeeze](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png) and hell tbh I'm hoping that it does do that instead. ***I mean look at that shit***

**SET LIMIT SELL ORDERS....? OR DON'T??**

There's tons of speculation on whether if setting limit high limit sell orders (420.69, 694.20) actually makes it so your broker can lower that shit and kind of forcibly sell your stock.

I don't know about you, but personally I'm watching this shit constantly so I'm not setting limits at all but I'm actually not too sure which advice is good to follow, maybe it depends on the broker as well?

~~Will edit, please correct me if you have the answer.~~

edit: check comments, still am not personally sure about limit sell orders.

again, checking this stock once/twice a day is good enough to not set limits at all.

Anyone who is familiar with MBS's might be thinking, that's a boomer play - "I want my money to pop!" Let me explain what has happened this last year and how that has affected specific stocks, ETF's and bonds (yes I said the thing boomers get off to).

If you are familiar with GSE's like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and so on, you know that rates have been suppressed by the feds for the last year and people have either gone into forbearance on existing mortgages or have been refinancing or buying homes like crazy to get these excessively low rates. Now those in forbearance are getting jobs and coming out to refinance before rates go back up because they inevitably will.

Now onto MBS's; if you find the right ones, you're looking at 10x returns over the next 2 years (slower than your GME but still a beautiful return). Which ones are the right ones? Let me share some of the ones I have been looking at and the ones I am loading up on and in what way, because these plays are very specific depending on your choice. 

Ultimately you want an MBS that has been buying up lots of Ginnie Mae and they likely also have been buying up other GSE's as well. It's quite simple what happens now that democrats have control (traditionally rates are higher) as well as an inevitable stop to keeping rates down. Rates go up, so do these types of picks, as they are now collecting heavily on those increases.

If you look up RC as an example, you see that since rates have been low, so has this pick also. GIGB, GSST, and MBB are more logical plays than this, only that these companies have not been down like other MBS picks. You can hunt your own down using the Mortgage-Back Securities criteria, as it really doesn't matter because all will be up. If there is a play you think WSB should focus on then say so in the comments and we can get it upvoted. I personally like the potential gains on RC.

My play would be to buy ITM call options with as high of delta you can afford as far out as you can. Most MBS tickers only have options out till September but I imagine the uptick will still be significant enough in those 6-9 months as it would in 2-3 years. Any MBS will do, but I’m favoring RC and another (banned ticker) just because of the greater upside potential.

TLDR: Mortgage-back securities plays like RC will pop in the next two years as rates go back up

Edit: it’s apparent a lot of you idiots don’t know shit about lending and base your knowledge from on the big short. I’m talking about Government-Sponsored Enterprise like Ginnie Mae. Imagine good loans (not subprime using options ARMs like in the movie) that Uncle Sam will keep floating like a JPowell printer._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Restaurants, NYSE: KO, Your Quiet Ticket to Tendie Heaven The autists of this hellpit we call a forum come from many a place across the world, but many of us live in the United States and despite how diverse the cultures of our country are, there is one thing we see coast to coast. The fatass American. Their natural habitat is the aisles of Walmart, preferring watering holes filled with sugar and surrounded by plains lush with potato chips. Now you may avert your eyes out of politeness, you may stare for a second out of surprise or give an inward chuckle but you should be thanking this graceful beast for it is on its back that you will ride to your gold plated mansion. 

&#x200B;

KO is the play here. These guys are in the pit of the worst COVID Round II could throw at em. With pubs and restaurants recently restricted in the UK ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52977388](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52977388)) and the US still under lock downs in many states the restaurant and entertainment industries have been hit hard. Coke-a-cola sells to just about everyone in these sectors. That is a bold as fuck statement, but think about it. It's impossible to find a fast food restaurant without coke and even harder to find a sit in entertainment or dining establishment that doesn't sell coke products unless Pepsi has bought rights. Given 39% of their revenue is from North America ([https://market.us/statistics/food-and-beverage-companies/coca-cola-company/](https://market.us/statistics/food-and-beverage-companies/coca-cola-company/)) this establishes a retard's understanding of why they're down so where does the fatass American come in. 

&#x200B;

Here. Uncle Sam just unloaded his printer onto the financially ignorant masses at the same time the vaccine is being delivered out to the most at risk. People are going to be biting at the bit to have restrictions removed and no politician wants to continue the small business blood bath the shutdowns have caused. Fatass American sees slowly opening businesses and has 2k in government money to do whatever the fuck they want with. You can bet food, theater and sports properties will be rolling in it. KO is gonna be there for all of it. 

&#x200B;

Combine this with a beautiful chart, showing support quite near the 48.58 the stocks currently at and the ungodly strength of this bull market this is one that simply cant go tits up. I'm in for the 4/16/21 50c because I fear theta gang and it's cheap enough I can grab a dozen. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fatass has government money, restaurants and entertainment gonna be selling more food soon, "I'll have a large coke" uttered by millions, buy 4/16/21 50c if you wanna give yourself some breathing room, buy 02/19/21 49c if you have the golden balls of the bull._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB pls 🌝 tomorrow 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thank you Biden welcome party & TSM for saving my portfolio [+100k today, NDX calls] _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FB stocks will drop, because ad revenue will drop Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up "Do you allow this app to track you across different apps". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network).  They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) " Could Have A Material Business Impact".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

More info:

 

1. Some quotes:

Facebook [published](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/18/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem/) a blog post outlining a test it had conducted comparing how revenue differed between personalized and non personalized ads on its Audience Network. Facebook said it observed “more than a 50% drop” in publisher revenue when personalized targeting was taken out of the equation —though it didn’t publish a detailed outline of the study.

2. The iOS market is the most profitable mobile market. It represents around 50% of the total revenue for app publishers, while only 27% of mobile owners have an iPhone.

3. In any case, the advertisers won't be able to track properly the performances of their campaigns. Even if they will still be able to target users, they won't be able to know how efficient it is, as we used to today. Moreover, if you increase the amount of ads in Facebook, this will definitely have an impact on the retention rate / session length. This is a lot of fine-tuning, but the solution isn't there.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue annoucement of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

You all came together with BB and just demolished the shorts, I hope GME can benefit from such an awesome community 👏._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME Questions/discussion about Citron stream and potential Uptick Rule creating a gap up Friday before closing To everyone who pointed out that I’m an idiot. Thank you.

Basically if $GME drops -10% tomorrow; due to Citron’s stream, I have some questions about what would happen.

Questions (on mobile and it’s hard to research):

1) If we hold above $39 today and then the citron attack drops it by -10% tomorrow; closing above $35. This would in turn reinstate the uptick rule going into Friday and the $35 shorts/puts would begin to, ideally, cover their losses by buying in, correct?

2) if 1 is correct then the 35s buying in, to cover, plus us buying into the dip would hopefully push it to $40 forcing the 40 shorts/puts to cover as well; since everything is expiring for them on Friday. Assuming this is all accurate then we should see a big spike Friday toward end of day as everyone is forced to cover? This could lead into potentially starting, or setting up, the squeeze for next Monday/ Tuesday since the $45 is the last big gamma step we need to break. 

If this is inaccurate feel free to point out, again, that I am an idiot. I’m just looking for insight and to discuss this further.

Looking at today’s trading day, was going to be what I think was the real test to see how much longer a squeeze could take. I don’t know the exact timing but here are some observations that I observe. 

The SEC rule 201 was lifted today. Which means the shorts had an opportunity to drive the price down as much as they could. There wasn’t a significant drive down as of today by 2:52pm. This makes me believe one of two thing:

1) Yesterday’s reports that there are no more shares to short are true. Which makes be believe that the shorts also took a long position at some point to hedge against to much upward loss. Which, if you have that kind of money in play is both smart to do and feasible. So now, they are burning through those shares to make us run out of steam and give up. I think this because if you look at volume spikes today, the stock goes up at significant increased volume spike and then slowly goes down from there. It looks like they are trying to match the buys and sells so the stock price stagnant. I don’t know how much stocks they have long to be able to do this but around half of the days volume has to be a sell if the price is somewhat flat. That’s a significant amount of shares if that’s the case. So who actually knows how much inventory they have less. My assumption is not many. In this scenario, it’s just a matter of time until they run out of steam if stocks continue to be purchased or people hold the shares. 

2) They still have available shares to short and we just don’t know it. Even though we have the reports that there aren’t any, there’s a chance that they are wrong. Because today is flat, means they didn’t use all the short shares available. This makes me think that they are going to try to get the price to go down tomorrow as a coordinated attempt during or after the Shitron live Twitter event. What they will try and do is spook the retail investors who don’t have the guts for volatility to sell at the same time, then they use the rest of the available short shares, and maybe sell the rest of their long shares ALL at the SAME TIME. That will spook other people and then a mass sale happens driving the price of the stock down. To me this could be a very real threat. Not sure what to do in this scenario, but I’m sure somebody who is much, much more experienced than me knows how to navigate (please please please comment below). I would assume that the longs need to know not to sell no matter what happens and rally one last time and buy up the rest of the shares. Hopefully, management knows this threat and also has a plan of their own.

Further thought of the situation, I think the shorts were forced to come up with some kind of PR that’s going to scare people. If they didn’t do that and then colluded together without that event, it would be deliberate market manipulation. But if they can piggyback on retail selling out, they can get away with pulling an all out attack. 

Luckily, for retail, they did give us a heads up of an event which gives retail the time to come up with its own plan on how to defend. 

Retail can do what everybody has been saying, don’t sell. Also, as shareholders and now there is a lot of you, you can suggest that GameStop corporate come up with a strategy as well or ask them to release some more info on their plans for the future and such. GameStop already has a bunch of press right now and some sorta news can be really good to combat what could happen tomorrow. As a public company they have to have its investors in its best interest. Since a short seller is not technically an investor yet (they haven’t physically bought shares like all of us) we might be able to nudge corporate in the right direction. Maybe send an email or give GameStop corporate a call and ask nicely for some news tomorrow. 

Game stop investor relations phone number: 817-424-2001.

[https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pay attention to Twitter. It will have interesting activity in the future. Twitter cutting Trump off from his crack was a completely retarded business decision. About 50% of US Twitter users interacted with Trump's tweets in one way or another on a weekly basis. I'm hearing rumors of 7-10% of people leaving Twitter and there is a mass exodus on the right. Twitter is continuing to ban more conservatives and is also reactivating accounts for random people to offset the losses.

Twitter is going full activist and ignoring their businesses best interests. They may or may not have a good next quarter because half way into the election they decided to stop showing political ads. During their harvest season they left half the shit in the field to rot because they didn't like it's color.

Now look at this pew research on Twitter: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/

80% of tweets come from 10% of Twitter. They are currently removing all the big named conservatives that cause explosions of tweets in response to their tweets and they got rid of the Tweeter in Chief. 

As the right gets removed from Twitter only the left will remain. Anger gets more reweets than positive tweets so without the mixing of the two engagement is going to drop massively and it's a multiplier effect. Mix that with parlor being #1 in the app store recently and gab getting tons of new users. It's not looking good for Twitter.

Twitter is the sick man of big tech and Trump tweet storms was it's life support. There is going to be a bloodbath coming to their stock soon. It's a question of who notices first._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Yet another GME yolo - 4000 shares Previously profited 80k on GME January22 and July21 20Cs. Sold those last Thursday.

Personally, this is easily a 75-80 stock in the next year - squeeze or no squeeze. Lots of negative and positive hyperbole out there, but just trust your positions and sit tight for a while.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dKS5fuu8/

But for people who can't read a fuckin chart I'll break it down for ya.

Reasons why I'm in big PLTR:

1. Beautiful flag setup.
2. The 7 & 30 SMA's (blue and white lines) are giving it some support for this bitch to pop off.
3. The 50 SMA (red line) has crossed into the flag and is angled up which is huge support.
4. HUGE** the MACD is about to cross to green. Think of that as the green light to liftoff 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Blue vertical dotted line is DDAY which could catch the eyes of the big pigs with fat wallets.

Once this bitch crosses the flag all of the technical traders, yes there's people who trade on technicals alone and make more $$$ then your grandpa made in his life, will jump on this ship with us to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

There's enough posts about how this company is growing rapidly with contracts so go look that shit up if this doesn't twist your nipples hard enough to jump in. 🚀🚀🚀

For those of you who read this whole thing I'll reward you with a few more rockets, cheers. 
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I sell Apps and help the Autists? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One Solid Gamma Squeeze Candidate post-GME Lately I've seen a lot of posts from ya'll looking for the next Gamma Squeeze, because even though GME is pretty epically set up, it can't be the ONLY one, right?

I have searched and found a candidate that offers some real Gamma Squeeze potential. Allow me to set out the case for MAC and please feel free to add commentary if you have any: this is exploratory.

MAC

Macerich is an owner of high class malls, owning 10 A++ rated malls, and 18 A+ or A rated malls. This means that of the 47 total properties they own, over half of them are A++ or A+/A malls.

Why does this matter? When it comes to malls, consumers tend to flock to the highest rated. A++ malls believe it or not make up 28% of all Mall revenue in the country while only comprising 4% of total malls.

In an environment where malls are thought to be dying, this is an important factor to account for. While many malls will be closed down, the best malls will likely further expand this already sizeable marketshare.

MAC is a debt risk, with 1.8 billion worth of debt maturing in 2021. However, MAC's debt is non-recourse debt, which means they can basically give the keys to any distressed property back to the bank with no penalty to the company.

Now, so far this has just been an "investment thesis" for MAC, but the Gamma Squeeze angle is where it gets interesting.

Currently, MAC has 150 million shares outstanding, but the float is only 91.5 million. Of that float, 88.16% are currently sold short.

With a current share price of $14.50, MAC is trading below book value of $16.50. Simon Property Group, for contrast, is trading at 17x book value. If MAC were to be bought out, they would be bought out for a premium on book value of conservatively 3x (literally just taking the SPG premium and assigning MAC \~1/5 of that number in a potential buyout), and that would instantly make MAC shares worth $49.50.

I bring up the likely sale price of MAC to show just how badly undervalued this stock is relative to its intrinsic value. Currently 88% of the shares are sold short, and there are plenty of reasons to turn these sellers into buyers scrambling to close their positions.

So that's it, high short interest on a stock that is trading below book value while competitors are trading at 17x book value, whose biggest concern is debt load but could be bought out at an extreme premium and also has non-recourse debt which favors the debtor.

NOKIA ($NOK) - Is currently priced at **$4.22** \- *UNDERVALUED.*

It's clear to see the new CEO (Aug 2020) - Pekka Lundmark (from Finland the home of the company) is transforming the companies future to a more innovative sector.

Beyond, the new innovative transformations of the company within 5G and networking. They have recently had a lot of **interest from the US** after they dumped Huawei. 

After all of these huge contracts they've secured within 5G they are expected to crush earnings on 02/04. Expected value on the date of ER: **$5**

5G is only just starting to kick-off and with the US dumping Huwaei, NOKIA seems to be the biggest front-runner and contender.

Like how can you have people who manage money in a professional setting talk like this, and still hold confidence in their decisions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WAB DD 🚂 Westinghouse is a very old company but the product is amazing. Now Railroads have always been a solid return. You might be thinking what railroad is the best? CP? CSX? UP? CN? All the class 1 railroads make money, hand over fist, but guess which company supplies the airbrake system to every single freight locomotive? You guessed it WAB (wabtec).

They recently made some acquisitions with GE, and a lot of talks about electric freight locomotives. Regardless of if the locomotive is diesel or electric literally 99 percent of locomotives use Wabtec. There is no other company that makes this product, and all locomotives use airbrakes.

If they do make an electric loco then sky's the limit for this company but even if they don't, they essentially have a monopoly on a niche market that is not going anywhere anytime soon. Pulling freight with locomotives is still the best way to transport large amounts of goods. Rail is king and WAB is solid imo.

Also Bidens infrastructure plan calls for more rail movement and rail traffic is already increasing, so I think this is a great short term play too.

No rockets or calls, just a solid stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Modest NIO gains.

If AMD hits 100+ by 02/09/2020, I will be getting a tattoo of the WSB LOGO on my chest.

 https://imgur.com/gallery/5LhXeTZ 

After edging ATHs of close to $100 on January 11th, AMD took a massive dump the following week and dropped below 90 dollars. Much of this was due to Intel's appointment of a new CEO as the market viewed this leadership change as a negative to AMD's stock price. BMO capital downgraded AMD's price and the stock fell nearly 10% in a week. 

If you weren't retarded, you took this drop as a buying opportunity, as earnings day is coming next Tuesday (1/26/2020). With AMD poised to shit on earning expectations, AMD is looking to runup on the days before earnings. The high anticipation of a strong 4th quarter combined with the high IV will drive up premium prices, as the releases of the new consoles that utilize AMD PS5 and XBOX series X were smashing hits. Additionally, when you take in that PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade, and that the notebook market share is growing by 50%, the demand for AMD has never been higher. 

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/)

"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects AMD's CPU market share to jump to 50% in 2021. That would be a big increase over the 22.4% market share it was sitting on at the end of the third quarter of 2020, as per Mercury Research. And as the company seems keen on improving its ASP, a higher market share will ideally result in stronger top- and bottom-line growth in 2021."

Now enough of this boring shit. Here is my promise for my tattoo:

If AMD breaks 95+ by 1/29/2020, I will get a tattoo of a rocket on my chest.

If AMD breaks 100+ by 02/09/2020, I will get a tattoo of the WSB man on my chest.

The tattoo (if happening) will take place on February 9th/10th with a post update.

About a month ago I had 30 of these contracts for .35 and my paper hands got rid of them. Here's what you need to know. $NOK has this new autist in charge and his name is Pekka. This degenerate gave us the opportunity of a life time. During the last earnings call he did what any true manipulator would do, he said his company sucks so that the shares would tank and he could get in at a lower cost basis. Now that he made a RH account in his nieces name there is no doubt in my mind this guy is holding big time. This shit is going to moon. Want some proof? Here it is.

Share price dropped below $4 to represent the 4G world we live in.

$NOK signs a bunch of 5G deals and partners with some others for 5G.

What is 5G? I didn't go to college but if I were to guess... 5G stands for $5. Which means $NOK is going to $5.

* Speaking of streaming -- Summit is one of the most popular streamers in the world #TeamCorsair
* The peripherals/accessories industry is the best market to be in. Let the smart guys fight it out over benchmarks, a constrained chip market, performance metrics, race to the bottom in profitability, while Corsair provides the simple stuff like fans, CPU coolers, power supplies, peripherals, cases, etc. Margin rich and unaffected by the bullshit that AMD / NVIDIA / Intel / et al have to deal with
* Their market cap is tiny compared to their addressable market and annual growth figures -- if nothing else buy shares, as this will be at $10bn in no time

edit 4, Didn't close today, I expect another small green day tomorrow, at least enough to cancel out theta.  My 1M+ 1 day gain record got shaved to 800k

edit5, When I say rolled weeklies- week to week- for me that meant, starting the week, I would  buy calls expiring that week, take my profits at the end of the week.  Rinse and repeat the next week with the ALL gains from the previous.  It worked because BABA gave me consistent green days for like the last 3 weeks.  Careful- **WEEKLIES can blow your shit up**, use STOP LIMITS, cut your loses and move on.

My first calls where 2 month DTE but watching it and seeing green everyday and feeling confident BABA would steadily climb to at least 250 I took a chance rolling out of the 2 month DTE to weeklies to swing for bigger profit. I was getting like 30-40% return per week the 2 month DTE, whereas on the weeklies it was 100+% per week._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pre-earnings AAPL Direction is Upward Attention People Who Hate Money:

Massive plays right before tweets from market movers must at least be investigated.

Citron tweeted when GME was shooting up to $45.  There was a huge run-up to it, and it looked like the squeeze was starting.  Then this:

https://twitter.com/therealYuriM/status/1351840403033620481

If they made a massive put/short play right before the tweet, then they knew by tweeting that the stock would then drop enough for them to profit enough to at least offset losses on other short positions, as well as give a way out for other shorts and stanch their bleeding.  I don't believe they're doing this based on any due diligence, that it's blatant market manipulation, even without collusion.

[EDIT] SEC complaint form here: https://www.sec.gov/complaint/select.shtml  Thank you, /u/No-Blackberry-1089  I filed a complaint, and everyone is free to use what I entered as a template for their own complaint:  https://ibb.co/CW1js3v

They tweeted at a too-convenient time for the shorts.  I believe their thesis isn't based on any due diligence.  Even if there wasn't private collusion, a massive play by a market maker right before that market maker tweets is textbook manipulation.  There should at least be an investigation to see who made plays, and why the timing was so good.

Most importantly, our due diligence was *thorough* and ***public***.  Let's get the SEC to crack open Citron's CompuServe email and AOL chats to see what due diligence they have done, if any, before tweeting. If instead they find a page from Cramer saying "tweet the intertubes!" then Citron will at least get fined and it'll show the crooked side of Wall Street that a public, ethical hivemind can fight back, will fight back, and can win.

I posit that we can't be hanged for manipulation because of the public nature of our discussions.  If they come after us, they'd have to go after *all of finance journalism.*  They can't.  That's free speech.  Both sides of the aisle will fight for that right.

I'm long on GME.  I'm going to profit no matter what the bears say because I believe wholeheartedly in new leadership that they'll adopt and execute a new, better strategy and that the stock price will recover.

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher.  Currently about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin.

So why does this matter? VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016, as a result, pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017-2019. This all changed with Covid-19 and the election of Joe Biden. While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms, background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check. The number is up 60% YOY in 2020 from 2019. The FBI completed 39.7 million background checks in 2020, this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 (it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check).

https://preview.redd.it/c1izzcvkafc61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ef284674000d6b7a477e1fdc11c69e6847f0c0

This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo. Ammo demand increased by 150% alone just in H1 2020

[https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27)

Due to massive shortages, ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon. For example, quality hallow-point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0.35/round back in late 2019.

[https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo](https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo)

today, the same ammo costs upwards of USD1.4/round today, up nearly 4x in a year.

Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders. VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3-4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre-covid levels. This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years.

Now we get to valuations, the company is sitting on around 2.1-2.3 billion in normalized sales (about 60% from ammo), growing at 30% on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November. Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow-out in the Dec quarter, I am expecting somewhere around 80-100 million. If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters, the company will deliver around 400-500 million of Net Income. The company currently has a market cap of USD1.6 billion, which would give it a forward PE of 3x. During the Obama years, the stock was trading at 11x PE, and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners, with more expected in the next 12 months.

This stock will easily be in the 40-50 in the next few months and 60-70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst.

Now lets talk about risks. People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo. This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus, I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court (one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts)

[https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf)

"The Second Amendment protects "arms," "weapons," and "firearms"; it does not explicitly protect ammunition. Nevertheless, without bullets, the right to bear arms would be meaningless. A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose. *Cf. Heller….*(holding that "the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times … makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional"). Thus "the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right" to obtain the bullets necessary to use them. *Cf. Ezell…*(holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms)."

As you can see, unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller, ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future. Moreso, there are likely over 400 million firearms in America, that is a lot of ammunition (which is a consumable) which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms.

**Call Option on Chaos (Alternative to the VIX)**

So again, you guys are all convinced you'll make 10x from calls on GME, PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that's maybe a 2-4x. Well, we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other (TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir) and squeezing shorts (GME), this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets.

Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now, marching around with rifles and plate carriers, and largely LARPING , but it doesn't take much for things to escalate. There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen, and the body politics is getting more and more polarized. If a black swan event were to happen, expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical.

The real political VIX is in the price of ammo, and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO. I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost. I think VSTO is essentially a low carry/free VIX call right now, which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio.

TLDR: start making bullet farmer memes.

I have about $100k in shares, about 10k in long dated calls.

Orbital Aerospace Companies are companies that launch, make, service, or operate platforms in the orbital space, including satellites and launch vehicles.

Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months. This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

&#x200B;

[Most frequently held stocks](https://preview.redd.it/87r1vy9bkic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe1c8a89f6f603dd000223a4a26ee69402002fa)

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The "WallStreetBets Portfolio" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

&#x200B;

[$WSB Performance](https://preview.redd.it/cc17jspglic61.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=df61ec8ce1fc245a93cdb5fced42271e54f20de3)

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I’ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a moderate correlation, and anything less than 0.4 is considered a weak or no correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kerrisdale is short PLUG.

SKLZ- an online gaming/betting play. Cathy Big D Wood invested heavily here.

* Selling February puts for 25.00 allows you to collect 1.68 in premium or buy the stock for 23.32 if it drops below 25.00.
* Selling 30.00 puts allows you to collect 4.20 in premium or essentially buy the stock for 25.80.

PRPL- Prpl is bringing on 4-6 new lines this year. each line adds somewhere around 90-100M in revenue. I expect a business update as they have been very quiet. Concecensus target is in the high 30's.

Sell 3 legs of puts, 40's, 35's and 30's.

* selling 30's allows you to collect about 80 cents or effectively buy for 29.20.
* Selling 35's allows you to collect 2.85 per share or effectively buy at 32.15.
* Selling 40's allows you to collect 6.58 per share or effectively buy at 33.42. I expect you'll be assigned on these.

DKNG- this thing is waiting to pop. A while back when it was in the mid 40's i recommended selling 47.50, 50 and 55.00 puts. Most of those were very profitable with the first two hitting max profit. Online gambling in Michigan, texas and New York are bullish for this. Although, NYC revenue is TBD.

&#x200B;

GME- I know you  Handi-capables are all in on GME, I am not but GME has some gnarly premiums. Selling puts for 34.00 9 day expiration from now yields you 3.35, or forces you to buy at the effective price of 31.65. **Edit: 30.65**

> The Finnish state is buying shares of [Nokia Oyj](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NOKIA:FH) to send a signal that it’s ready to protect the maker of 5G mobile networks amid a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. has expressed interest in owning a part of the company.  
>  
>The state’s equity-asset manager Solidium Oy recently crossed the 5% threshold in Nokia shares, and now has about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) worth of stock

Even if you ignore the fact that it's grossly undervalued given their cash flow, even if you ignore they are the major player in 5G space and are already making billions in patent royalty a year.

Let's put all that a side for a second. The new national security concerns after the major Russian Hack and Chinese compromised hardware will continue to become top priority for many countries. NOK is a MOON stock in the making. 

* Finland is bidding the stock up to retain ownership and to prevent acquisition.
* Nokia itself has so much cash it has also been buying back back shares and will continue to do so. We are at the lows!
* Now USA is trying to buy stakes now that it's dumping Huawei.

Also since I expect people talking about the 5 billion shares outstanding. Yes but realize its a $4 stock, the average buys are much larger orders. Also for reference apple has 16 billion shares.

The 5G play just started this year with the release of Apple's first 5G phone, sorry for those who invested too early the years prior and got burned.

6.	Key dates: Earnings release Feb 11. 
7.	Fundamentals (not too important for this growth stock tho imo but wort noting): Revenue:  grew 39% YoY from 5M to 7M however, COVID really has wrecked them this year as they have only 1.43M in revenue thru the first 3 Quarters of 2020. Earnings on Feb 11 hopefully will show a big rebound in revenue to support the bull case.

I think Callaway/Topgolf ($ELY) has potential to become **the** WSB meme stock. This could be a hole-in-one. This stock is so pun-worthy that its haters will learn to become lovers and together WSB shall unite to show off its big swinging dick in its full glory  **🍆** **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Jokes aside though, I think $ELY finds itself in an underappreciated growth sector and is well positioned through its recently announced acquisition of Topgolf. Without further ado, here are three reasons I have [YOLO’d my lifesavings into $ELY](https://ibb.co/QDv2bdM) (and before I get called a snake for not being in $GME, I would be if my broker offered it):

**The synergies bro:** With the acquisition Topgolf, Callaway has gained access to a pipeline of innocent, easy-to-deceive newbies that will latch on to the first golf brand that looks even remotely professional. Topgolf venues will be kitted out Callaway merch for newbies to buy and the newbies will duly oblige. It is estimated that 50% of Topgolf’s 13 million annual visitors (which will increase with Topgolf’s expansion into Asia) are non-golfers, so Callaway will be in a strong position if it reel in even a small proportion of these newbies.

**Callaway poised to transform golf:** Callaway has not just bought an entertainment business through its acquisition of Topgolf, but also an incredibly fast growing tech product, Toptracer, that allows amateurs at driving ranges to track the distance, ball speed and curvature of their shots. Toptracer has been rapidly adopted, with installations at driving ranges having grown by a multiple of 16 since it was put on the market in 2017. The room for growth here is massive, with Toptracer technology currently installed in only 7.5k driving ranges out of an addressable market of 650k. Over time, as more of Callaway’s revenue comes from its tech offering, I can see Callaway’s share price increasing just as a result of it being considered more of a tech company.

**And finally, BOOMERS:** I hate how boomers look down at me for being a neckbeard. I live in a small town where boomers cross the street if they see me approaching them. I don’t even look like that much of a degenerate. They just see a young, attractive metrosexual like myself and act as if I’m a skunk. I might be a pot head but that’s beside the point. Fuck’em. I am overdue respect. So where do boomers come into this and why is $ELY an opportunity to get one over boomers? Well, boomers are a key target demographic for the golf sector given they have the time and disposable income to waste all day on a golf course. As the below graph shows, boomers are still maturing, with number of people ages 65+ in the US set to increase for the foreseeable future. I expect $ELY to be a beneficiary of the US’ ageing population. Boomers have fucked us over so we should at least profit from them.

I am expecting more demand for the stock after this date. This is a show an prove story abd the company has already proved with 100% revenue growth in Pluto TV. 

You have Pluto, paramount plus, and showtime, the IP catalog is deeper than anyone else and second only to Disney in top tier franchises. The catalog of the older films and shows can be remade in addition to the massive existing pipeline of content. I’m expectIng a lot from paramount and the MiraMax deal is still not being talked about. Expect a huge drop of content in late February.

I’m long on streaming with Disney too but this trades at a fraction of the p/e and undervalued by any measure. People are talking about them getting acquired but that’s past this point they are going deep with streaming and I think you’ll see even more content coming from then to others like Netflix and Amazon and Apple. Viacom cbs has more production capacity than anyone else because of all their cable projects as well as CBS. CBS sports, showtime, BET, MTV, Comedy Central, and many more brands. 

Also see the NFL on nick was a huge success and I think it could lead to even more sports content on the network.

I see the best value play on one of the top 3 best streaming plays, Disney is first and Netflix second and it’s obvious viacomcbs is a third place lock given how poorly others have launched like HBO max was a disaster. 

Do your own research on this one but we are few months away from this becoming the biggest play for streaming in terms of pure upside. Viacomcbs are still priced so low they can make mistakes abd the stock will still go up. If you consider how well they have done on execution post merger this price is ridiculous. 

On any meaningful valuation analysis this company is objectively undervalued and will continue to increase in price as more news comes out about paramount plus.

We will also get updated financials as end of year result on the 24th and it will lead to another big signal that this firm is finally in the right direction.

TLDR: LUMN is grossly undervalued and has potential to rocket to 4-500% over the next 6-12 months. 🚀🚀🚀

**Overview of LUMN**

* Centurylink was rebranded as Lumen Technologies at the end of 2020 after a horrific year (24.5% drop in 2020). Lumen Technologies is in the telecommunications sector and has millions of subscribers. It is very much a boomer company, founded in the 1960s. However, this new name change is a step forward, focusing on where technology is taking everyone.
* $12B Market Cap, $21B in revenue and 39000 employees
* Current Price: $11
* Short float: \~11%
* Dividend payout: a whopping 9%!

**Thesis for this Boomer Stock to Rocket 🚀🚀🚀**

* **Dividend payout + growth**: This stock sank in 2020 mostly due to the risk of it's massive dividend being cut, after cutting its dividend in early 2019. However, it enabled the company to clean up its balance sheet and last week announced plans to refinance its debt, allowing for lower interest expenses that will enable not only the ability to sustain their dividend payout, but enable dividend growth in the future as well. 🚀🚀🚀
* **Rebranding as a technology company**: After rebranding at the end of the year, LUMN mentioned this is because they will be looking to focus more on the growing Fiber market which is growing extensively. The company is growing to further taking advantage which can be seen by the job postings available. 🚀🚀🚀
* **Grossly undervalued:** This company is currently trading around \~20% under book value, with a drastically low P/E under 10. Analysts have begun raising its price targets in the last month and will continue to do so. Lumen has not traded at these levels since the early 90s when their revenue was \~$350M, by comparison, revenues now are over $20B. 🚀🚀🚀
* **M&A Target Potential:** Given it's recent sink in the market making it so undervalued for a large Boomer company, coupled with its recent debt refinancing makes LUMN a great M&A target candidate for a bigger company to take over. There is already chatter on this topic although nothing substantial yet. 🚀🚀🚀

**The Technicals**

* **Falling wedge pattern:** Lumen Technologies has been falling since 2014, in which before that, it was trading sideways for almost 20 years. This has created a falling wedge which looks like it will be ready to break now that it created a nice base in 2020. 🚀🚀🚀
* **RSI Breakout**: To confirm its breakout of the falling wedge, RSI appears to have broken out as well on the monthly chart. This RSI downtrend dates back to 2011, 10 years ago. A confirmed breakout would certainly be something to acknowledge and it some extra juice to run up 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

[LUMN Monthly Chart - Falling Wedge and RSI Breakout](https://preview.redd.it/8qzybgyp1ic61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10736a4ad16fa41d2a14ab0142d799afbba7c4d)

**Current Target: 400% return** I believe this stock at a minimum has the ability to quadruple and a Motley Fool's analyst agrees with me. This stock offers an excellent Risk/Reward. It likely only has 20% downside (which I intend to add heavily if we see it) compared to a 4-500% return which in my view is conservative given that revenues/profits have increased from its all time highs when it was around \~$50. Based on the technicals, I suspect that we see this squeeze over the next 6-12 months with the majority of the move taking place in the next few months. 🚀🚀🚀

**Current Positions:** I intend to begin building my initial position today with $10K in shares (@ 10% dividend, I would gladly hold shares to be paid to wait) + $10K in LEAPs (January '22 $15 Calls, I may add January '23 as well). I intend to add on every major dip we get until we reach $40 on the stock in which I plan to begin trimming profits at that point. 🚀🚀🚀

Thank you for your time and consideration,

TheHanemeister 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on $FIZZ, possibly next big 🚀 short squeeze Short story for those with ADD:
-Second highest “short to float” ratio to GME
-Higher ratio of shorts to volume than GME
-Low float, moves on air
-well known brand (LaCroix) that is printing money via high/steady profits and is in the process of paying our $250M in special cash dividend

If you missed GME, BB, etc, this may be the next big one





Full DD for those who care:

Posted yesterday about $FIZZ, which has all the ingredients for a short squeeze for the ages. I did some more DD, and am aggregating it here. $FIZZ is the LaCroix sparkling water company, with plenty of other lesser known brands

-short interest of 7.3M shares on a float of 8.8M shares (83%, which is the second highest to $GME among all stocks, as far as I can tell)

-given average volume around 300,000/day, it would take shorts 27 trading days to cover (this is the highest I’ve found, about 5 times what it was for GME before the squeeze
[fizz short interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fizz/short-interest)

-1 person (founder and CEO) owns over 33M shares, and he’s an old Italian guy who hates short sellers (so he’ll never sell, which is the definition of💎🙌)

-late last year they announced a $6/share dividend which is payable in February (remember, shorts have to pay the dividend for any borrowed share because the company only pays the didvidend once per share, while a short share is borrowed and sold, meaning 2 people “own” the same 1 share.)

-recent uptrend in price and volume coincides with the epic $GME squeeze, likely indicating an attempt  by shorts to begin covering. But the total volume of <1.8M the last 3 days wouldn’t even put a dent in the short interest, and we all know that only a fraction of that was shorts covering.

-Company still has over $100M in cash and is hugely profitable
     •33% ROE
     •20% operating margin
     •>$200M operating cash flow
     •44% earnings growth
[fizz financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIZZ/key-statistics?p=FIZZ)
     •CEO will get $200M CASH from the dividend. I could see him buying another million shares to lock away, further reducing the float and making short covering even harder 

So a profitable, growing business with an old Italian CEO who is angry at short sellers, paying huge dividends, and a potentially even further reduced float. Think about shorts trying to buy back 7M shares from 💎🙌 WSB traders when the days to cover ratio is 27.  Even $GME was “only” about 5-6 (which is a very big number!)

As an added bonus, some chart guys can add to this, but the 3 month MACD Golden cross happened Friday, it is now above 20 and 50 day averages, and probably some other stuff I don’t understand.  😂

I think $GME was the king due to the short interest being higher than the float, but this isn’t far behind, especially given its ability to move large amounts on low volume. The stock is up about 20% the last 3 days on almost no “extra” volume, and given the volume increase the shorts would need to create to cover shares while fighting retail and institutions who see this coming too, this could definitely double, triple, quadruple, who knows. That’s a lot of shares the shorts need to pry from people. And being honest, current holders of stocks like this may not even be the kinds of people that check their portfolio religiously, so you may even see market makers having to sell shares they don’t have to keep an orderly market since there’s not enough liquidity to cover that many short shares, which just adds fuel to the fire. Plus, the dividend and threat of another special dividend has to scare the crap out of them as a double whammy of buying back at a big loss and then paying out CASH to the people you sold to.

I definitely look forward to the smell of burning shorts on this one.

Lot of discouraged GME folks since yesterday's failed launch, so wanted to share my own bullish outlook. Like [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor)'s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzphxt/gme_dd_fair_value_is_at_least_74share/), I used the most conservative projections, but unlike [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor), I continued the analysis down to the profit streams based on my interpretation of RC's strategic outlook for GME. Sorry for the finance hardo LARP but for those of you who can do math read past the TLDR.

**TLDR considering RC's strategic vision, GME's future profits mean fair value/share is $58.53.** 

 

**Store Closures and Brick & Mortar Revenues**

RC's already said he's disgusted with GME's lack of action in closing stores and expanding ecommerce. Gamestop now plans to close 1000+ stores at the beginning of this year ([source](https://www.thathashtagshow.com/2020/12/09/gamestop-closing-1000-more-stores-by-april)). Since GME leases all their stores on terms of 1-5 years, contracts can easily be dropped as they expire ([source](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/9d2139e1-31c7-498f-ad95-63db1e6d085a#page=19)). In the following screenshot, I projected the amount of store closures for each year and evenly redistributed the remaining renewed leases to expire over 1-5 years. The results show that with the expiry scheduling, GME will be able to cancel a steady amount of stores every year, reaching below 1500 locations in 2026. 

https://preview.redd.it/epirp2ddxhc61.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b48f37fba9b5cfa16640f636fc5ab06ef947fd

To find brick & mortar revenue, I used the same revenue per store from FY2019, which was an exceptionally poor (but probably realistic) year for GME but not a terrible outlier like 2020, for obvious reasons. While it is likely that in-store sales naturally decline in the near future, I assumed that GME would not close their strongest locations and thus be able to maintain a steady revenue/store. 

**Ecommerce Revenue**

So I said this wasn't a GME circlejerk, but honestly, every good GME DD needs some outlandish assumption. Mine was that GME totally reinvents itself and maintains 5-year revenue growth in-line with e-commerce startups such as Chewy (is this really so outlandish?). Some other assumptions are that COGS holds at \~70.4% (same as LTM) and SG&A holds at \~23.6% (average since 2013). 

https://preview.redd.it/cdtkdg4gxhc61.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c1500bf900feb533ceff6eb88af94141db14d5a

S/O to [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor) for the proxy that I also used for the first year's ecommerce revenue: I took the 9-week holiday sales as 83% of Q4 sales, with 34% of these being attributed to e-commerce.

https://preview.redd.it/72ek3bakxhc61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7a0b91464afbb4df21e60492d1221ef22fa905

**Depreciation & CAPEX**

To get my depreciation values, I used the total land owned/leased in Sqft ([source](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/9d2139e1-31c7-498f-ad95-63db1e6d085a#page=19)) and proxied depreciation by sqft. This meant I could calculate the total D&A after store closures as well as find D&A for distribution centre expansions.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/902ln5smxhc61.png?width=379&format=png&auto=webp&s=750d659d6a721ef2ee91f1c0a9c5c5bc18204d42

To find how much new distribution spaced would be required, I considered Chewy's distribution centre size in comparison to their revenue ([source](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/NC10011622x1-CHEWY-INC._10K_2020_V2-Bookproof.pdf)) and used this to find how much space GME would need for each year's projected ecommerce revenue. Additional required space would contribute to CAPEX and the new total space would be depreciated at $8.24 million per million sqft. To get a value for CAPEX, I used Chewy's cost/sqft of distribution space and appreciated this by 2%/year. 

&#x200B;

**Investment in Working Capital**

Since RC would shift GME to a primarily ecommerce platform, I used comparable ecommerce company turnovers to find GME's working capital account values. I figure GME should be able to achieve these turnover rates after 5 years. 

https://preview.redd.it/hdwu811uxhc61.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=7543f53f91cfa43e63e957f8153fd71cb0f37faf

If you're still with me hang in there - this is the last of it. NOPAT uses EBIT found above, less 35.5% tax (average effective rate since 2013), and D&A, CAPEX, and Delta NWC were found above too. WACC used was 10.6%, considering their 2020 bond issuance at 10%, 8% expected long-term S&P500 returns, and 1.1% 10Y treasury rates. I used a terminal growth rate of 5% since I'm pretty bullish on the video game industry in general.

&#x200B;

And as you can see, this brings us a fair price of $58.53/share. Again, I used the most conservative estimates that were still reasonable. If you believe more in multiples, [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor)'s analysis that was similar in revenue projections valued GME at $74/share.

* The Capitol Hill invasion followed by Trump's censorship and Parler shutdown has further enraged the alt-right. There are 7,000 UN troops in DC right now, and Trump has deployed Black Ops ahead of Wednesday's inauguration. Ideally, Biden's inauguration goes smoothly without any hiccups... but in 2021, ***it would be naïve not to expect some chaos***. This is by no means a waterproof strategy, rather merely an investment play betting on a negative outcome come Wednesday..
* Highest potential profit is $226, highest potential loss is $274. Breakeven price is $20.24, and cost to implement is $274. This strategy has a negative theta, so it gains with time decay, as well as a negative vega.
* Smith & Wesson Guns has always gone up on events where the Donald gets his way or shit hits the fan, so now you can have a reason to see chaos ensue today

**Additional DD below on Vigtory acquisition:** 

FuboTV Inc. is buying an online sportsbook, a deal that makes the over-the-internet TV provider the latest sports- rich media company to invest in sports gambling in an effort to attract and retain viewers.     

The company said it is in the process of acquiring Vigtory Inc., a sportsbook that it eventually plans to integrate into its TV platform. Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV        subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.     

In an interview, FuboTV Chief Executive David Gandler said he expects sports wagering to not only generate more revenue for FuboTV but also make it more likely that customers will pay closer attention to sports and tune in more often. The company also recently acquired Balto Sports, a company that develops tools for users to play fantasy sports.     

Sports content tends to be the most expensive on TV, which has led many internet-TV bundles to raise their prices. Over the past year, YouTube TV went from $50 a month to $65 and Hulu +        Live TV from $55 to $65, while FuboTV raised the price of its standard package by $5 to $60        after it added a suite of Disney-owned channels including ESPN.

Everything is based on ORTEX estimates._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD: Undervalued at $90 \[I couldn't post yesterday: had to remove a link\]

AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well. 

**Intel struggles**

Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)

**AMD Q4 and FY**

EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.

**2021&2022 Outlook**

But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply a P/E off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (60). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.

**Booming Market**

Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion. Also, ASML had earnings today and raised their outlook as well. This could imply that supply is not as constrained as some people are assuming for the coming year(s). This has led to me being more bullish than before.

2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan’21 100Calls.

https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years

Next he tried to sue Tesla

“This appears to be a textbook case of fraud,” Labaton Sucharow partner Michael Canty said in the release. “We believe Musk attempted to manipulate the price of Tesla securities with false and misleading tweets, in a directed effort to harm short-sellers.”

From the man who tweets misleading reports as per Hong Kong and tweets in a directed effort to benefit himself. 🐍 

Let’s continue. His cute disclaimer on his website. 

https://citronresearch.com/legal-disclaimer/

He makes no representations and disclaims all accuracy and timeliness of material. (I can make shit up). It’s for “informational purposes only” (yh sure).

“Under no circumstances should our reports be considered investment advice” yet they tweet “buyers at these levels are suckers”. Not investment advice but don’t invest ... 

“You agree to hold harmless citron research for anything attributable to our report.” Do i? Just because it’s written doesn’t mean I agree to that, no.

“Citron research has positions in securities covered in reports ... and may continue to transact for an indefinite period after a report” ie. we can sell our own dip. That’s fine. Trust me, I wrote it in my disclaimer. 

“All expressions of opinion are subject to change without notice” same shit, we can buy them sell while we mislead you all our original idea and actually buy a dip. Lol get fucked followers. 

Finally, “at no point will citron be liable for any claims, damages of any kind” etc. “Arising or out of in any way connected with any information presented in our reports” ie. we can lie, make shit up and we are invincible because we wrote it here. This applies “regardless of any negligence or gross negligence of citron research” so even if we are grossly negligent, still not our fault. 

Etc. Etc. Bullshit bullshit. Fraud fraud. 

What’s ironic is he does have a history of reporting some companies and uncovering fraud therefore reporting them to the SEC. Naturally, over a few years I imagine this is why the SEC turns a blind eye. They have a bastard making money for himself in many cases illegally, but twice a year he does find a fraudulent company and the SEC can say thank you very much for doing their job for them. 

Oh, and the NFA did him over for making “false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud and deceive a customer in violation of FNA compliance” back in 1998 banning him for 3 years. His ethics training course was really helpful, clearly. 

Oh and this - which basically makes out that he’s some bad ass, and openly discusses how he opens his position, tweets bad news, moves the markets, a stock falls 15%, promises to go on tv, panics the market and explicitly talks about his influence through Twitter. Not a bounty hunter, he’s a white collar criminal. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/magazine/the-bounty-hunter-of-wall-street.html

TLDR. Andrew left is a fraud who mixes finding genuinely fraudulent companies and exposing them, with random hit pieces of self interest and stock manipulation. The SEC have been helped by several of his discoveries so they don’t give a shit that he’s immoral and corrupt. We can’t even stop him making money as he sells/buys on the dips his own report creates.

Edit 2. Shock. The fucker delays. Of course he does. Needs more time to close out his positions, spread fear amongst us for another 24 hours. Christ. This is so fucking illegal.

Their CEO is **John Crowley**, a Harvard MBA & Naval Academy grad with a mission to help kids around the world. You know he has the right work ethic and more importantly, the right motivation to see this through, because his own kid suffers from one of the rare diseases he is looking to treat in the near future (*Pompe* disease).

Their current revenue-generating star is a drug called **Galafold**, a pill meant to treat a rare disease called *Fabry* disease. This disease affects approximately 1 in 40000 men worldwide and Galafold is currently the best and most convenient method of treatment.

[2020 Revenue](https://apnews.com/press-release/globe-newswire/business-technology-science-pandemics-public-health-560528f65fcb19c3c0d7b261224e1f3e#:~:text=Global%20revenue%20for%20Galafold%20in,the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20towards) for Galafold was $261 million, and the company has previously stated they are on track to hit the[$500 million](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3015206&headline=FOLD-Amicus-says-Galafold-on-track-for-M-revenue-by-) yearly revenue mark by 2023 for this drug alone.

Now, where the real potential for cosmic launch magical shenanigans lies is in their [upcoming treatments](https://www.amicusrx.com/programs-pipeline/pipeline/) for *Batten* disease and *Pompe* disease. Do yourself a favor and read through, because this is a potentially undiscovered gem that is about to rock the world of rare diseases and quite literally do God's work in helping kids around the world.

# Pompe disease

Amicus is currently on track to publish results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of their Pompe disease treatment within the next weeks, as their study [concludes this month.](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03729362?term=NCT03729362&draw=2&rank=1)

This drug trial [has previously been fast tracked by the FDA](https://ir.amicusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-btd-amicus-gaa) and the drug([AT-GAA](https://pompediseasenews.com/atb200-at2221/)) has been given the BTD (*Breakthrough Therapy Designation*) by the agency, which is one of the most promising votes of confidence from the country's leading healthy agency.

Currently, estimates show there are up to 12,000 patients suffering from Pompe disease worldwide, and the current treatment cost for Pompe is $300000 (yes you read that right), with a drug offered by another bio company called BioMarin.

If approved, Amicus' AT-GAA drug will be the most efficient treatment method for Pompe in the US (and potentially worldwide).

Now, I have no idea of how they might be pricing this novel drug, however even if they undercut their competitors by 50% (which is really unheard of), that puts the cost for the treatment at $150000, meaning an **initial potential revenue of $1.8 billion** worldwide (not counting the newly added cases of Pompe in the population, yearly).

The company has recently initiated a [rolling FDA submission](https://pompediseasenews.com/2020/12/02/amicus-begins-rolling-fda-submission-of-late-onset-pompe-disease-lopd-therapy-at-gaa/) seeking US approval for their drug, meaning that they will start submitting important parts of their application as they go, rather than submitting the entire application at once. What this means for you, my dear autist is that good news will start trickling in as early as next month, gently rolling upwards into a phallic crescendo of green colors aimed for interstellar space by the end of this year.

# Batten disease

Amicus is in their [Phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02725580) for this treatment, scheduled for completion in November this year.

What's important to know here is that the incidence rate for this disease varies around the world, and from my research, I can estimate it on the **lower** end of that variation to 1 in 100000 people.

Their treatment for Batten disease is a **gene therapy** treatment, and what's even MORE important to know here is that[a similar gene therapy treatment is known to cost more than $2 million](https://battendiseasenews.com/2019/12/10/gene-therapy-takes-center-stage-at-2019-nord-summit/). Yes, you also read that fucking right.

With about 1300 people being born with this disease **every year**, that means a **potential revenue of $2.6 billion**. Now, of course not everyone in every country will afford this (depending on their medical insurance/coverage), but still that's an insane amount of money.

And the paramount factor here is that this is a fucking terrible disease, with devastating effects on the sick patients and on their families. We're all lucky to have these people working on fixing it. There are about 6000 rare diseases affecting people around the world, and Amicus is destined to be a spearhead company tackling problems which have not been tackled before.

The company [is working with University of Pennsylvania](https://ir.amicusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amicus-therapeutics-and-university-pennsylvania-announce-major) on discovering additional gene therapy treatments for other diseases.

Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed “*activist*” we’re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : “He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.” His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world’s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again “After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.” Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn’t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). 

SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn’t enough wait to hear the companies in his “*ambitious track record*”. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could’ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the 🌈🐻 because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.


**SCANDAL #1**. Here’s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this 🌈🐻 was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing “false and/or misleading claims” about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He’s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo’ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW 🌈🐻 said they’re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE’S **NO WAY** THEY’RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now i’m pretty sure if you’ve been active on the sub you’ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I’ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he’s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron’s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

**NOTE** :

Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.

A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway 💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼 its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode 🔥🚀

TL;DR : Citron’s been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WON’T EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB. LET US FUCKING TAKE OFF AUTISTS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Edit #1 : Citron really just chickened out of the livestream that was taking place lmfao. THIS IS WORKING EVERYONE HOLD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Discussion Thread for January 20, 2021 Your daily trading discussion thread. Please keep the shitposting to a minimum.

💎👐🚀🪐_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What should we do with Gamestop shares? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ YOLOing on $SRNE All right degenerates, time to get serious. $SRNE is a power play. If you don't believe me, look at the volume over the last couple of days + this DD. ALSO FUCK THE SHORTS  


**SRNE has cash on hand + cash coming its way from investments**:  "Selvaraju \[some analyst who possibly knows what he is talking about\] also estimates that the company will be obtaining $320 million from its current investments. He cites Sorrento’s investments in biotech companies Celularity and NantKwest ([NASDAQ: NK](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NK)). First, the former will be merging with GX Acquisition Corp ([NASDAQ: GXGX](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=GXGX)) to go public. This would entitle Sorrento to about $200 million in shares."   


"Another point to consider would be the company’s solid financials. In its recent quarter fiscal, the company saw year-over-year jumps of 103% in total revenue and 116% in cash on hand. Its recent FDA application for its coronavirus test kit sets up exciting times ahead for SRNE stock."

sauce: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-biotech-stocks-to-watch-this-week-2021-01-18](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-biotech-stocks-to-watch-this-week-2021-01-18)  (Yeah article calling it a biotech stock to watch this week)  


**SRNE is making power moves to defeat different health issues humanity faces \[Don't forget its always cool to donate to good causes\]** I am focused on 2020 and 2021, so I only am familiar with recent positive results from their studies pertaining to cancer and COVID.   


There is a lot of anticipation for EUA approval for a couple of SRNE products that could combat this fucking pandemic. Mexico, Brazil, USA could use SRNE's help and apparently \[Noah Ritter is the man\] SRNE is working hard to penetrate those countries \[in a good way'

**COVID - Its a fucking pandemic**  
With all of these strains, virus mutations, and other madness, shits not going anywhere anytime soon. Billions of people all over the world, not enough vaccines to go around before 4/20. Therapeutics are an alternative for people who are concerned about vaccines. Go use some fucking COVI-STIX then...guess who makes them YEAH SORRENTO.  


**GOTTA LOVE MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS**  
In 2020, Sorrento announce that they acquired SmartPharm "a gene-encoded therapeutics company developing non-viral DNA and RNA gene delivery platforms for COVID-19 and rare diseases with broad potential for application in enhancing antibody-centric therapeutics." [https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/3f2bc5fa6cb7419775f5afb19a622f10](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/3f2bc5fa6cb7419775f5afb19a622f10)    


Also, already mentioned earlier... Sorrento is one of the owners of Celularity (list of Celularity stockholders: "Celularity stockholders (including Sorrento Therapeutics, affiliates of Bristol Myers Squibb, Starr Insurance Companies, and Dragasac Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genting Berhad)" \[YEAH WE OWN STUFF ALONG WITH BIG NAMES\]....Celularity will be merging with GX Acquisition.  


**PRICE TARGET**: HC Wainwright analyst gave it a $30 PT. We all know people hate on us, but why don't they hate on older degenerates that just buy into whatever an analyst says? Because they fuckin love the fuckin analysts and the big money. OK WELL I'M GETTING MY SLICE MOTHA FUCKASSSSSS  


**CEO talking today**   
I dont know what Dr. Ji (yeah he's some sort of Dr. which is cool because he probably ate crazy amounts of pussay in whichever school he went to). IDK what the hell he's gonna say there but all I know is some people will listen to him and they might decide to throw more money into the pit.  


**SHORT SQUEEZE**  
I hate shorts. Mother fuckers are getting lit on fire with the pre-market action (currently up over 13%) and we know that market action could get crazier once opens to all degenerates across the world. Not sure where its at now, but I think short interest was at 30% yesterday? (don' quote me - check for yourselves...do the DD cause I am not sure).  


I honestly don't know what the fuck i am talking about. Do your own DD, I am serious. Its your money and you should care about and verify what you are getting into. I have been on a win streak, but its cause of luck. I hope everyone makes $, finds something nice to do with it, and make the world better._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Citron's GME short is not against WSB but against everyday investors I spent a disproportionately long time reading up tweets from Citron Research and other high profile (in public's eyes) accounts that are shorting $GME (or claiming to be).

It's quite clear that they are all scared. And it's impossible for them to cover without booking loss. Call premiums signal that.

They aren't against WSB. They realized people here won't sell. So what's the other way that can exit this position? They are trying to get more short sellers on board that can **take their positions**. And these new people will disproportionately be retail. These companies are not for public good.

I wish there was a way to tell other people who are their followers that they are being led to a slaughter house. 

I understand this post won't go far. But even if few people see it, I think the message can eventually spread

Edit: 💎🙌 500 GME @ $38_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alaska sells Intel, Gilead, and Qualcomm to buy more Tesla stocks. Soon we are on the Mars 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’m a lucky duck getting this 15 seconds before market closed _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing spreadsheet template, to see all the gains you got on you precious GME stocks  A week ago I saw someone post their portfolio template, so I thought I'd share mine. I tried to make it as retard-proof as I could, but I'm sure I'm underestimating you guys.

I use my template to see the gains/losses i've made on stock that I have sold.

Some quick info: You will need to copy it to your own google drive. Some functions won't work when downloading to Microsoft Excel. Also I have protected the formulas and titles, so you can't change it on accident.

[Click here for to open the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ndAyqLq0rD6iE7LMKdpKiyNUFQ2wDDEs9A7C8nn5H4/edit?usp=sharing)

On sheet 'Investment 1', you can individually add your orders. (I recommend this sheet, as this one is way easier)

* Under 'Purchase', you should fill in the price/share, amount of shares, fee, exchange amount (Enter  
1 if the stock is in Dollar) and purchase date (the last 2 are needed for formulas).
* When you sold that stock, enter the sale in the 'Sale' section after the purchase of that stock. The  
spreadsheet will calculate the gains/losses you've made.
* When running out of lines you can add lines by rightclicking the second last visable row and select  
'insert 1 below', then press ctrl+D (when the added row is still selected) to copy the formulas from  
the cell above.
* In row 27 there is a sum of; the total you have currently invested, the total you have purchased and  
sold, and the total you have gained/lost.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Investment 2', it is the same principle as the previous sheet, but here you can group the stocks.

* This sheet will also calculate how much you currently have invested in each stock.
* It's a little trickier to add rows in this sheet. You will have to be carefull not to add a row after the bottom row of a stock (for example row 11), otherwise the formula that calculates the total of that stock will not calculate those rows. Instead add rows at the first row of a stock, or the second last. You can always hide the last row of a stock to prevent that from happening, as I have done with Tesla and To the moon.
* When you want to add a new stock you can add a few rows at the second last row(Row 12, Row 13 is hidden so the formula doenst get fucked) equal to the amount of rows a stock group has, so you can copy those rows into the new rows. For example Tesla has 3 rows (row 3 to 5,row 4 is hidden), so add 3 new rows behind a stock group, then copy those Tesla rows and paste them into the new rows. Now you have the formulas so you can delete the data in the new rows.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Strategy', you can keep track of how much you want to invest in stocks, options, etc.

1. Add the total budget you have into cell C1
2. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each section (Cell B2, E2, H2) and give it a name in the cell to the left
3. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each row of a section (Example: Cell B3, B4) and give it a name in the cell to the left.
4. The sheet will calculate what the budget is for each stock or whatever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope I didn't miss anything. Also hope you guys find this usefull, if not, then buy GME stocks right the f\*ck now. F\*ck Melvin, all my homies hate Melvin. 💎✋

Courtesy of Jack Ma reappearance, electric vehicle announcement, and upcoming earnings 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB yolo update _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Time&Sales analysis on 1/20/2021 between 949am-10am Hear me out GME gang,

I took Time&Sales data from my broker - details of each and every GME trade that happened on 01/20 between 9:49 and 10am, right when price swinged wildly from dip at $43 to $45 and down to $40.

I wanted to analyze how swings like these happen and why and below is link to my Tableau Public dashboard:

[https://public.tableau.com/views/GME\_Analysis\_2020\_01\_20/TimelineAnalysis?:language=en&:display\_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/GME_Analysis_2020_01_20/TimelineAnalysis?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)

am I onto something?

&#x200B;

The parameter on the right lets you choose what to look at: Bid Exchange (Which exchange the buy order originated from?) and Ask Exchange (Where the matching sell order originated from?)

&#x200B;

The big picture is that majority of buying volume is coming from:

1. EDGX - 25%

2. NYSE - 22%

3. Third Market Maker (what is this?) - 21%

4. P (NYSE ARCA Options) - 13%

5. IX (IEX?) - 11%

Majority of selling volume was coming from:

1. Third Maker Maker - 23%

2. NYSE - 22%

3. P (NYSE ARCA Options) - 19%

4. DE X (EDGX) - 16%

5. Z (BATS Options) - 9%

&#x200B;

What I am thinking here, is that this volatility like that when prices swing wildly is driven by algorithms/options market makers (HFT) that do delta hedghing and then unwind their positions as they pass options inventory to somebody else.

Does anyone here studies market microstructure ?  happy to connect and discuss in DM.

Is there a benefit to study this data for a prolonged priod of time - keep in mind this is only 11 trading minutes of data._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Big T - Why I'm Long 2000 [$58,000] of Your Grandma's Favorite Stock 🚀🚀🚀 Listen up, asshats. I'm super fucking long T. For those of you less gifted; the Big T ticker is for AT&T. Regardless, I'm here to help you and the rest of this fucking market be learnt that HBO Max is not priced into your Grandma's favorite stock.

People ask me, "What? AT&T owns HBO Max?" Damn fucking skippy it does. And people ask me, "Hey, you. Who gives a fuck?" And I tell them, "You do, fuckhead."

Here's the deal. How can Netflix and that ass-shit-fuck hammer of a streaming service Disney+ have forward-looking PEs above fucking 9000 and Big T only have a **forward-looking** PE of 9. Fucking 9, I tell you. Now, some people say, "Oh no, Big T got **BIG** debt." And I tell them to look at the interest rates. "Look at the debt market. You can fucking buy a house with half a fucking sandwich as collateral nowadays. They'll refinance. Fake News."

Fourth paragraph. 7.25% dividends. That's 3x your shit-ass Robinhood margin interest rate. You can't lose.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

* If Disney and Netflix can have a forward PE of 50+, then Big T's PE is too fucking small.
* If Verizon's and Disney's market cap can be 650B combined, then Big T's 200B MC is too small.
* HBO Max is not priced into Big T @ $29
* 7.25% dividends for ye ol' bag holders
* The debt market is dope for large corps to refi
* **Do what nana tells you; before she gets the paddle.**

------

Every chart you look at probably has the X axis as time. What happens if you make the x-axis volume, instead?  What would this even mean?

Assume that each time a stock is traded, it's the market moving forward towards what it thinks the fair value of the stock is. If you agree with this assumption, then days of high volume see the market move towards fair value more, and days of low volume see it move forward less.

Put another way: days of high trading volume are "fast-forwarding" through "fair-value time". Days of low volume are "slow-motioning" through "fair-value time".

Fortunately, there's a way to view price relative to volume.

**[Here's a regular chart of GME, with time as the x-axis.](https://imgur.com/IYoHHEQ)** Keep in mind Set 2020 is when Cohen got on board.

It looks fucking crazy volatile, and it looks like GME is blasting off to space. Citron will tell you this is "too much, too soon". Your instinct might tell you the same.

**[Here's the same chart, but with volume as the x-axis.](https://imgur.com/JJBwveA)**

There are many things to note:

* There's as much volume in the last 4 months as there was in the 11 months before that.
* A very steady growth rate since Sep (thanks, Ryan)
* Drops are generally on days of low volume
* The volatility in the last 4 months doesn't seem as crazy

From this perspective, GME isn't mooning.  It's not *that* volatile. It's just that the market has picked up its pace of valuing it. We're moving through "fair-value time" faster.

If you buy these assumptions, and if you also have a bullish thesis about GME's fundamentals, then you shouldn't feel nervous about the high-volume days coming up.  **You should be happy that the market is going to be reaching a consensus about fair market value much quicker.**

Personally, I think the market is starting to value GME as a growth stock. I don't mind if it does this faster.

So, we've all seen Citron's/Shitron's tweet about how they have big news or **5 rEaSoNs WhY** you should sell GME tomorrow. I think now is the time to look closely at what they're attempting to do. I'm beginning to better understand the position of the firms like Melvin are in: totally underwater and fucking drowning.

Even still as GME's stock rises, these Melvins are *continuing* to take short positions\[1\]. Now, I am just a humble retard with a ~~cultural anthropology associates~~ worthless degree, but I can read at a 6th grade level, and I think I finally figured out what that means, "taking shorts." I'm even going to type it out loud for you all so my dumb smooth brain can hear it. (And please correct me if I am wrong.)

They (the rainbow bear firms) are borrowing stock from a broker, selling that stock *immediately* at market price, and then giving the broker a note scribbled on the back of a soggy cocktail napkin that says "I O U one (1) share <3". So that means if some fucking boomer firm tomorrow buys 100,000 shares on short, they're *borrowing* 100,000 shares from a broker, selling those *borrowed shares* for cash (e.g. 100,000 shares \* $GME at close = $3,936,0000) and then just hoping and praying that every GameStop on Earth gets hit by an asteroid, the share price falls to $0, and they don't have to pay back one cent of their gigantic loans.

Holy shit. Taking out a loan and then hoping you don't have to pay back the loan isn't investing—it's fucking retarded.

Melvins are getting seriously desperate and will try to distort the reality of GMEs situation, so whatever news you read about GME tomorrow from the mouths of these hedge fund firms (Cramer, Shitron, Melvin, whatever else bullshit these boomer dinosaurs throw at us) should be taken with a HUGE grain of salt. The only strategy they have is to borrow more shares and sell them to drive the stock price down. They put their feet in giant cement shoes on the gamble that GameStop is going bankrupt because HURR DURR MALL STORES. Well, now is time for the "retail investors" to show them how fucking wrong they are and make them pay for it. Can't stop, won't stop, *et cetera.*

**TL;DR: fuck Citron; diamond hands rocket to the moon.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Even the big dogs see the short squeeze. They're just trying to scare us to sell GME [https://www.barrons.com/articles/whats-powering-gamestop-stock-it-could-be-a-short-squeeze-51611099998?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/whats-powering-gamestop-stock-it-could-be-a-short-squeeze-51611099998?siteid=yhoof2)

&#x200B;

Some key notes are:

*" On Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock’s fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  "*

*"* [*After the pop last week*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-doubled-last-weekbut-challenges-remain-51610751952?mod=article_inline)*, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock’s massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month. "*

*" Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for* [*a short-squeeze*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-soars-as-short-sellers-take-a-hit-51610572262?mod=article_inline)*, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions.* ***Pachter said such short sellers were “squeezed by rabid retail investors.”*** *He didn’t think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.

&#x200B;

So keep the hands at diamond or DOUBLE DOWN. They are scared shitless. The actual squeeze might happen much sooner than you think.  GME is gonna pop SOON and HUGE._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $18k in $BB. Not much but this is all I have...trying to do my part🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME on Tuesday: Why didn't the squeeze trigger? What about the shorts attack? **What was the "Rule" about?**

Rule in place was essentially that they can only short when on an uptick

**Why didn't the squeeze happen on 1/19?**​

Squeeze did not happen today because of a couple of reasons:

1. There were outstanding shares for Citron/Melvin/short sellers to continue to short to push the price down. At this point, we can see that there are barely any shares left for them to short.
2. Paper-handed autists who panicked-sold when they bought in at 43-34 and saw it drop to 38 without understanding it was going to happen due to the shorts.

They [timed their tweet and simultaneously shorted close to 2.2m shares](https://i.imgur.com/MMb3i5n.png) but people were relentless in buying them all up. As we can see, the trackers eventually stopped tracking the shares available to short, as it went from a million down to [8,000 to 7,000 bouncing back up to 100,000](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773545837212598284/801303927215226901/dq6ajcxm7bc61.png) before it went radio silent.

​

Yet even with their efforts, people still bought and they barely tanked the stock price at all. It even tested the 42 price limit once again just prior to power hour.


**How did those 100,000 shares get freed up?**

Yes, you got it, paper-hands who are selling their shares & refilling the shorts' ammo.

Also brokers who borrow shares from people's account on opting to pay them interest for the melvins & citrons to short (please explicitly call your broker to say you do not want them lending shares out)

They are done, unless there is a mass exodus of people who sell their shares(we can clearly see that's not the case, any dip is immediately bought up and we go right back to challenging any price limits of 41, 42, 44) ; the interest rates for them to borrow shares to continue to short their positions will eventually kill them. We are already at 57% interest over the weekend, we are so very close.

​

For the squeeze to occur, many people must understand what is actually going on.

​

If you do not, then seeing it fall from 43 to 38 in a couple of hours will definitely scare you. But there's a reason why we call it diamond-handing, because none of these actually matters. There will still be dips, there will be always people paper-handing their shares but once it squeezes, it will be glorious. There are people who got in over a year ago and have made millions who will not let go, because they fully grasp the situation.

​

Don't let your heart rule over the sensible minds who know this inside out for a year or 2 in this one, because if you are afraid the squeeze is not coming and decide to sell your shares, just know that the same way it gets continuously bought up at 38,39 there will be people who still go in.

I bought 48 X 2/19/21 C @ 30.00 on Jan 13 at the latest peak so you can trust me when I say I'm autistic.

Let's start with some background information for the uninitiated. Corsair has been a  🚀🚀🚀 since launch coming out the gates at $13 in September and peaking at $50 in September. Many of us computer enthusiasts know Corsair. I type this on a PC I built with a Corsair water cooler, case, headset, and keyboard. Its a brand made for bulls by bulls. Unfortunately, us CRSR bulls have had a few red days in a row and my Wife's boyfriend is starting to ask why we can't go to the Olive Garden as much. Corsair tanked after Market close today (Tuesday) presumably because of a filing that came out stating that 7.5M shares will come up for offering. Obviously, none of us could read it and sold off when we heard the news. Fortunately, my mom was could translate it in to big boy words.

**Whats going on?**

Right now, most of us are asking why Corsair would issue common stock from shareholders. Corsair as a business is not profiting off of this, so lets see who is. The preliminary document (subject to completion) is available on the investor relations website and filed with Edgar. We can look at this.

From the document:

`When we refer to the “selling stockholder” in this prospectus, we mean the stockholder listed in the table below as offering shares, as well as the pledgees, donees, assignees, transferees, successors and others who may hold any of the selling stockholder’s interests.`

Looks like we've got a table of insiders (who may choose to hold) as well as anyone offering up shares as a part of this endeavor.

Something stands out like a sore thumb in this table. "Corsair Group" aka EagleTree Capital holds roughly 70% beneficial ownership. That's 70 million shares.

&#x200B;

Beyond this, we have

* Andrew Paul (CEO) with \~4,000,000
* Thi La (new COO) holding \~800k, mostly as shares exercisable
* Bertrand Chevalier (CSO) roughly in the same boat with 570K
* George L. Majoros, Jr. and Anup Bagaria with \~70,000,000 each

Wait a minute... the numbers in this table don't add up. George, Anup, AND EagleTree all hold \~70 percent of beneficial ownership!!!

George L. Majoros, Jr. and Anup Bagaria are each listed under the same footnote as EagleTree. George is the president of EagleTree and Anup is a CO-Managing Partner at Eagletree.

Okay, so I haven't mentioned everyone in the table from the document. I'll put in to perspective the shares held by EagleTree and affiliates vs executives.

* EagleTree and affiliates (excluding Jason Cahilly who holds a "small" position): 70,160,059
* Executives and other selling stockholders: 6,188,486

It's worth noting that the document also states:

`the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, EagleTree will sell an additional 1,125,000 shares of common stock.`

So what's happening here? Admittedly, I don't know. I'm just some guy who likes to play the robinhood game on his phone and made a silly 60k option yolo. I have a feeling that EagleTree wants to take a little profit from this. They are a capital group after all. Even if it's ONLY EagleTree selling, that's like 10% of their holdings in corsair. They want to explore new opportunities and invest in their "next" corsair. The execs who have worked hard to make this company want to enjoy some earnings, buy a house, lambo, yacht, whatever. This isn't a case of executives selling off because they know whats coming. That would be called illegal insider trading.

Take all of this with a grain of salt. I haven't even read the whole document. I also know almost nothing about business or investment. What matters to you and I right now is how the market reacts. I feel that this move is rational for Corsair. The market is not rational. I'm long term bullish Corsair, but these Feb calls... are stressing me out. At least they're ITM :D

**Discussion**

Does this seem like a logical explanation for the recent news?

We don't care if this  makes sense from a business standpoint. We don't care. We want this shit to moon! Is there any hope left? Some preliminary numbers came out in the document.

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is happening and what will come with respect to GME.

**Pre-amble**

For those that did not read my earlier post a link is below – it provides most of underlying commentary on what has been going on with GME with this post filling in some additional details. It’s unfortunately a long read and for most of you that attended the The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too, I wish you the best of luck (assuming you failed out).

Unfortunately for Jim Cramer (“Jimbo”), I didn’t bring him up in previous post because I admire him or watch his show. It’s because the man himself is going to help describe what happened today with GME. Cue up the video or a read the transcript below. I honestly find Jimbo annoying as fuck and I don’t want to force and of you actually listen or look at him.

[Transcript](https://slate.com/culture/2007/03/will-cramer-s-crazy-confession-destroy-his-career.html)

Before I actually get into some of Jimbo’s self admitted tricks of the trade and how they are being applied to GME, I need tell you a quick story about a lovely little real estate holding company called Global Links (traded over the counter) and an investor by the name of Robert Simpson. Simpson’s win was so big, he was interviewed on Bloomberg News on 14Mar2007 along with the CEO of Overstock.com (remember that company from my last post that hit 669 days on the Threshold Security List?). Well Simpson’s big trade was spending $5,000 to acquire 100% of the company (he actually acquired 111% or 1,282,050 shares), the really cool part of this trade was that despite owning over 100% of the company the trading volume over the next 2 days was 50 million shares.

The only other quick primer you folks need to digest the below is a quick understanding of market manipulation. As per the ever so useless folks at the SEC (directly from their website), market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).

Market manipulation may involve techniques including:

· Spreading false or misleading information about a company;

· Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded; and

· Rigging quotes, prices, or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case.

**Market Manipulation**

Again, a big thanks to the Eight Pound, Six Ounce, Newborn Baby Jimbo, don't even know a word yet (reference to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby because it pains me to think of that bald 65-year asshole). Let’s review the Institutional short’s toolkit and then figure out what is going on with our beloved Gamestop.

**1. Flooding the offer side of the board**: Any of you folks with level 2 data seen those fun price walls?

**2. Short Down Ladder**: Short A will open a new short position and sell a share at $40 and short B will buy that share to cover an existing position and the open a new short at $39 and so on.

**3. Media Assault**: I am sure we have all seen the fun tweet from Citron today and all desperately tried to get out of our positions. Any of you read business articles are immediately scroll to bottom to see if there a disclaimer noting that the author was paid to write the article? Conveniently the first article that pops up when I search GME on google includes “*The author has received compensation for writing this article” (Link:* [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637))

**4. Analyst Reports**: Undisclosed compensation and bias research is a professional no-no for many financial designations. Many of the current price targets seems unreasonably low, like below liquidation value kind of low – does any of this make sense ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/))

**5. Pulling Margin** – holy shit, didn’t this just happen - Short’s are starting to get desperate aren’t they?

**6. Paid Bashers** – Paying people to spam messages boards to create panic and insight selling. This goes way back to 2007 but trust me when I say this will only get worse ([https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/)

**Trading Day in Review**

What everyone needs to consider is that despite the shorts sparing no expense, the share price is still going up and the shorts are getting deeper and deeper under water every day and will only become more and more desperate. Their backs are against the wall and they need to fight to the death to survive. Closing out positions would result in long drawn-out Tesla Style squeeze and would still likely result in the bankruptcy of these funds. Their only chance pushing GME into bankruptcy (very unlikely with Cohen and Co taking over the board).

What some of you are starting to clue into and discuss openly is the visibility of market manipulation. I don’t really care what Citron will say tomorrow but if there is a Q&A someone really should ask how the short’s can postpone the close off requirements on Threshold Securities near indefinitely or when they try and ‘describe’ short interest maybe ask their thoughts about the legality of front running trades.

One of the sparsest sections of my original post was on the short interest. I don’t have access to the Ortex data and I will rely on others posts for this data. Remember Robert Simpson from the pre-amble who acquired 100% of the shares in Global Links and yet had his shares traded 50-times over the next 2-days? SEC enforcement has historically been extremely weak and the actual short interest could be much higher then what is reported.

Normal market price discover is simple economics – the price is established based on where supply and demand meet. More buying pressure the price goes up and more selling pressure the price goes down. All things being equal, how many people increased their positions on the dips today? How many sold? How many were forced to sell some of your position after your margin was pulled?

The market price action is that the currently described by the below (historical volume, daily high, and daily low can be viewed at: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/))

a) **The current float is small and shrinking**. Retail is going long and we want to keep buying and I want to retire in the coming weeks. Please sir may I have some more?

b) **Volume is unreasonably high** – every share in the company has turned over 5x in the last 4-trading sessions. If you did deeper into timing short attacks, you will learn that doing it upon earnings, press releases, or news announcements helps to mask the associated volume increase. If you refer to my original post, you will know that shorting a stock creates a synthetic share - if they Shorts try a hastily exit, the price will quickly start jumping up.

c) **Volatility is increasing**. If you look at the daily history, what do you notice about the range between the high and low? Citron announced a webinar tomorrow on how to remove the shit stains from their dress pants (Hint: it involves depressing the GME stock price so they can stop defecating in risk management meetings). Volatility will only continue to get worse and its all due to the actual float Shrinking. The Cake is a Lie (Portal reference).

If retail investors maintain demand and don't get disheartened, volume will continue to contract and the shorts are going to dig themselves into a deeper and deep hole until they are no longer solvent. This is exciting, I am “Jacked to the Tits” as we are going to witness the biggest redistribution of wealth in our lifetimes.

Thanks again for the your assistance explaining what is wrong with the markets Jimbo. I am still hoping there is a journalist with some integrity that might push out the real story on the GME play.

Fuck you, Pay Me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “Jack Ma Emerges for First Time Since Crackdown on Ant, Alibaba” - Good news for Baba bagholders. Jack Ma graduated from kindergarten. Congrats 🎉 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB Gamma Conditions **TLDR: Blackberry shot up massively today on a gamma squeeze, with market makers/dealers having to buy shit tons of shares (maybe 70 or 80m) to hedge all the options they sold you guys. That ramp is now used and is a bit of a liability, but not if you have diamond hands as a group. Movement up from here will require the stock attracts more money, but you get an EZ mode boost again from $14.5-$16.25 or so. Stock becomes less risky if you can reach $13. It's volatile at $12.6**

As you all know, there was a GME gamma squeeze last week (you guys say short squeeze, but I believe dealers bought 30m or more shares tues/wed/thursday to hedge all the options they sold you guys). Historic in scale I think, one of the largest ever to hit a small cap stock.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Completely not to my surprise, BB has exactly the same thing going on, with insane open interest, and you guys appear to have done it again today with BB, so that's two historic gamma squeezes over two weeks. I wonder which stock is next?  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I went and examined BB, in which I have absolutely no position and haven't the faintest clue what is up with it other than it's some sort of fruit 🍇 and space exploration company🚀 that also makes star trek style tricorders [📲](https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone-with-rightwards-arrow-at-left/), which all sounds pretty cool actually, so I should probably be long.

BB has a float or 508m shares. Here's the current gamma chart of the stock:

[https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9](https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9)

For those of you who haven't been paying attention, or are unable to form new memories for medical or genetic reasons, gamma squeeze is when the price moves quickly over various option strikes, causing dealers to buy a ton of stock (if price up) or sell a ton of stock (if price down) so as to not be underwater on the options they sold you guys. In other words, a stock with a TON of options bought by WSB will tend to move a lot faster in price around those option strikes.

Looking at this gamma chart, and those are in hundred thousand contracts btw, you can see why today went crazy. Today, BB, in going from $10.15 a share or wahtever to 12.51 a share, forced dealers to buy about 70 or 80m shares.... on a 508m float... which means they were 2/3 of the trading today. Not really surprising to buy 20% of the float on dealer action (plus whatever you guys were buying) and see a 25% move up. I'm a little surprised it wasn't more tbh, so there are probably some covered calls held by dealers in there, and those people are hating life right now.

The problem is though that you guys hit the end of the gamma ramp. That's why the stock slowed down after 12.5 - you can see it in the gamma chart. No gamma lift means no more forced dealer buying. The good news is there is another gamma ramp at 15, so if you get it up to like 14.5, it'll ramp real easily to maybe 16 16.25 I think, but after that, no ramp.

In terms of short-term trading dynamics, there are some options expiring this week - about 35 thousand contracts of calls. These will cause a VERY slight melt-up (maybe half a percent tops) as the week goes on, then when dumped or monetized Friday, will cause selling of 3.5m shares of selling, which isn't really a huge deal, and should have marginal effects on price, like half a percent at most down. Most of this open interest is much longer dated, mostly out a year or more.

Why does all of this matter? well:

1. It's going to be harder for the price to go up from here without new gamma established, or a lot more buying. Dealers did heavy lifting for you today with that 70 or 80 million share purchase (would have been more if shorted dated, but it wasn't). That's not happening again until 15, and at 15, it's still only maybe 25m shares in reality, not 70 or 80m, so you'd expect a smaller acceleration there.
2. If people monetize their calls, it's going to hurt, as dealers dump to de-hedge, and there's a gamma ramp down as you can see.
3. And of course, the stock is vulnerable to a push down since you have a massive gamma ramp below the price, and no gamma ramp above.
4. But, those calls are super long duration, so I would not be freaking out. I just think there's resistance up from here, which was seen in today's price action - no gamma ramp.

I have no idea where it goes from here. I have no idea if BB is undervalued. And I always disclose my positions, and have no position in BB. But, it's not at a stable price right here - resistance up until 14.5 or so, and a fast, greased up slide down if selling happens. If you can get to 14.5 though, it's an express train to 16.25 or so.

Consequently, if anyone wants gamma write-ups on other stocks that are trending around here, let me know.

I made these charts with [http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/) but my hedgie friends tell me they like livevol a lot. I probably should try that at some point too. [http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/) has pros and cons but gets the job done for this purpose._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A More Neutral View on Citron To further look into the history of Citron Research, I read the Wikipedia page on Andrew Left. Now I know how Wikipedia as a source can be biased and inaccurate, but there are several pieces of information here worth looking into.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

Contrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says 

>111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

Source [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)

Now this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.

However, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:

> Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push "questionable investments."[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course 

&#x200B;

> Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. 

He has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:

> Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, "Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron’s  recommendation doesn’t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!” 

Sounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.

Point is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.

Going into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.

TL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.

oh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: what I meant by "exercise caution" is expect volatility tomorrow, gme is likely to drop around 11:30 when shitron livestreams. At that point, selling will only help the shorts.

Shift Technologies (SFT) is a digital-focused used car vendor/sales platform similar to Carvana and Vroom. They are rapidly expanding and had real revenue last quarter, 60 million USD of it.

Now the amazing thing you all want to know is that they are severely undervalued when compared to Carvana and Vroom.

\- Carvana market cap \~ 50 billion

\~ Vroom market cap \~ 5 billion

\- Shift market cap \~ 650 million

Now do the quick maths folks on a company that is already competing with these 2 companies and is growing fast especially in stimmy nation.

The quick maths easily shows that its \~10x growth if they catch up to vroom and \~100x growth if they catch up to Carvana.

# DJ GameStop Stock Is Soaring. It Could End Badly. -- Barrons.com

https://preview.redd.it/t5f3zdu6lec61.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b68789578ac91a585a227c02e5b0fe37c9ad17f

GameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called "rabid." Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller.

Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop (ticker: GME) stock at recent levels "are the suckers at this poker game."

"Stock back to $20 fast," he wrote. "We understand short interest better than you and will explain."

Left did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron's asking him to expand on his thoughts, as well clarify whether he's taken a short position himself. But around the time of Left's post, GameStop stock pared back from a $45.52 intraday high. The stock closed up 11% to $39.36.

On Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock's fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock, when 144.5 million shares were traded.

GameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives, including co-founder Ryan Cohen, were joining the company's board. Cohen's RC Ventures has a 13% stake in GameStop, and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e-commerce.

The day of the announcement, the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week's ICR investment conference. A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron's to the conference for commentary on the company's long-term plans. GameStop representatives haven't returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since.

After the pop last week, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock's massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month.

Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short-squeeze, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions. Pachter said such short sellers were "squeezed by rabid retail investors." He didn't think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.

Left's post signaled he'll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream, set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Barron's has outlined a long-term bearish case. The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free-to-play games and digital downloads, both of which cut out physical game sales.

Despite new consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry, GameStop said last week its sales were down 3.1% from last year during the nine-week holiday period. The company pointed to store closures, limited console supply, and the impact of Covid-19. But comparable sales, which strip out the effect of store closures, were only up 4.8% from a rough 2019 holiday period.

Many of the most popular games, like League of Legends and Fortnite, are free to download and play. Instead, publishers offer in-game cosmetic items directly in their online store. For those games, GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman, selling gift cards for in-game points.

And as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles, it's the gatekeepers of such systems -- Sony, Nintendo (NTDOY), and Microsoft -- that stand to benefit. Meanwhile, PC game distribution is a crowded space. Valve's popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games, CD Projekt (CDR.Poland), and Electronic Arts (EA). It's unclear how an old-school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape.

Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming-streaming services akin to Netflix. Adoption hasn't yet been disruptive to the broader industry. Microsoft, another major cloud player, and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in-house content. GameStop has a profit-sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass, but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales.

Add it all up, and it's clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant.

[**SEC Keypoints when it comes to Short Selling**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)**:**

## D. Are short sales legal?

Although the vast majority of short sales are legal, abusive short sale practices are illegal. For example, it is prohibited for any person to engage in a series of transactions in order to create actual or apparent active trading in a security or to depress the price of a security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others. Thus, short sales effected to manipulate the price of a stock are prohibited.

**TL;DR: Illegal if aimed at depressing price to induce sale of security by others**

**IMPORTANT:** *This is merely a curious correlation I'm trying to understand, not evidence that this is what went down.*

But how about you ask them about this during their livestream tomorrow or upgrade those tips you are sending to the SEC a bit, they might have better means to judge, I'm just a retard.

36.50 is where they will buy and go long (at least for today). They know at this level, most retailers have cut their wrist with paper hands and closed out of positions or forced to get closed out because of stop losses. They saw around this price that there was a majority of stop losses.

Positions- 15 2/19 35c  5 5/21 35c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Venture Capital Perspective on GME Hi everyone.  Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it’s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I’m investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.

Full disclaimer- this is my personal money I’m investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I’m looking to see (which I’ll discuss below).

Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.

First, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.

**How VC's Invest**

When we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there’s a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:

1) What’s the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.

2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.

3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?

4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is "how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer ".

There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.

**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**

1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  

Now the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option

2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an "excited about a memeing CEO" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  

Again, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.

**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**

GME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.

I'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled "why entry multiples don't matter" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.

The short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.

So what is fascinating about GME?

**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** 

Instead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.

This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.

So why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?

**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**

If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.

**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**

The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.

This is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.

There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.

Maybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?

But here's the bottom line.

If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** 

I know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

This is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**

TLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.

As always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.**

**Don't paper hand this one.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Efficient GME Play With LEAPS Hi fellow autists, I've been thinking about our favorite ticker and what else can we do to make it 🌕.

It might get fairly long so for the illiterates TLDR: GME 1/21/2022 25c 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I will venture and try to teach you new word today (LEAP) and a bit of foreign language (Greek) so you may sound sophisticated when you talk to your wife's boyfriend, explaining him where did your last Wendy's paycheck disappear.

Now that DFV broke taboos and showed us that holding shares, like a boomer, can make us shitload of money I wish to propose another thing that does not get mentioned enough here - LEAP, or in plain english long term option.

Now why is this smoothbrain now dropping this weird shit when we know that shares are play here you ask?

That's because I think leaps are more efficient way to play GME in the current situation. They behave like our favorite financial instrument (FDs aka options) and because they are valid for long time they behave like a stock. So we get best of both worlds.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

Jan 21 2022 25c can be bought for \~$21/share, which would be $2,100 for a contract. Which means that for $4,200 you can get 2 such contracts. For the same amount will get you \~100 shares (that's leverage options will give us). This option has Delta (that's your Greek lesson) of 0.774. Simplified; 1 such contract behaves like 77 shares. Two such contracts are equivalent to 154 shares so for the price of 100 shares we can buy 2 leaps that have value of 154 shares.  

What happens next you ask? Well for every option buyer there is a seller and guess who the seller is for new leaps you just bought? That's right our beloved MM's and what do they do? They cover their asses by keeping their positions delta neutral. And what did they do? They just sold you 2 GME leaps with delta of 0.77 making them 154 delta short. To make it delta neutral they have to BUY 154 GME shares. So your beautiful autistic purchase of 2 GME leaps results in them buying shares which is exactly what we want.

I don't say buy only leaps, but consider expanding your GME portfolio with some of them since they are more efficient (control more shares for the same money) than stocks and give us some leverage that brokers took away from us by eliminating margin on GME shares.

I'd like more experienced autists to weigh on this and tell me where are the flaws in my argument.

Buy shares and leaps for big tendies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SENS I bought $1-$2 call spreads on this when it was between 60 cents and $1 and now it’s up to $3 bucks.

I’m considering buying more though as this really could be the next DXCM and run up to 40 or 50 bucks in the next year or two.  I’d recommend either shares or out of the money leaps. Looks like $5 July is as far and high as is currently offered and that’s what I’m eying next.

Melvin Capital is fucking retarded and their puts are expiring 1/22. Theta Gang can hop in now and help GME bulls while also pocketing some sweet Theta Tendies. IV is insane with most options at 200-300% or higher. Buying at just under $40 and selling $35c for 1/29 means as bulls ride the squeeze upward while Theta Gang has good downside protection.

Example:  Buy 100 GME at $38.75, Sell GME 35c 1/29 for \~$8 premium. You are in for $3075 and make money as long as GME finishes the month above $30.75, which it will. If your shares get called away at $35, you made $425 on $3075 invested, or \~13%. Good by Theta Gang standards for a week and a half of work.

The electric-car maker's stock is up 21% year to date. This compares to a 1.6% gain for the S&P 500 so far this year. Of course, this momentum builds on the growth stock's 743% gain in 2020. Suffice it to say, expectations are high going into Tesla's upcoming earnings report. 

Here’s why:

2020 was a breakout year for Tesla. Not only did vehicle sales spike, but the automaker also showed investors that it can generate meaningful profits. While we don't have fourth-quarter results yet, we know that the company generated about $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the trailing-12-month period ending Sept. 30. Further, free cash flow and non-GAAP net income in Q3 alone was $1.4 billion and $874 million, respectively. 

Investors will be looking for more meaningful free cash flow from Tesla in Q4, particularly since we already know the company reported a record 180,570 deliveries during the period (up 61% year over year).

You all know the DD on this shit already (EV/AV Play, not a Cellphone company, IVY, QNX, undervalued) but let me learn you a new lesson here. 

Why the fuck do you think a company like PLTR has a 50B MC? This thing does similar numbers to BB but loses more money and is evaluated at 7-8X the current price of BB. It’s because it IPO’d in the middle of the EV/TSLA crazy and had all eyes on it.
 
BlackBerry, however, is a fucking dinosaur! You ask someone on the street that knows nothing about EVs what BlackBerry does and they confidently tell you they make old cell phones. You fuckheads and wetdicks would say the same shit a month ago. That’s not who they are anymore, they just don’t have an IPO to get everyone’s attention which is why you can still get it at such dirt cheap prices.

The past 3 trading sessions were the FIRST 3 trading sessions that this thing has started trading as a speculative play, as it should! It has a new Cybersecurity suite to compete with CRWD, new partnership with AMZN to be a huge player in EV/AV. Huge partnerships with countless OEMs and carmakers, potential to partner with Tesla and it’s about damn time you autists caught on.

To begin with, today was an extremely good day for us, with the market closing at 39.36, which is a 10.38% surge 🚀.
•The day started of with a huge uptrend, spiking at 45.40$, and this is when Citron 🍋 posted their tweet @9:58AM and the price plummeted to 36.88$ within 30 minutes. 
They clearly manipulated the market with their nonsense. 
The 1.2 million dollar put that was detected and alerted @10:19AM COULD be theirs. Perfect explains why their doing the retarded live stream tomorrow.
So maybe go sign the petition to get the SEC to investigate them. 
All throughout the day, main stream media & 🐻🌈 on Twitter continued to write stories about how GME is just a pump&dump and how we retail investors will fail miserably. 
We managed to 💎🤚🏼 while buying even more stocks during this war (!!!) and maintained a price level of 39.80$-42.10$ throughout the entire day.
The end of day drop was inevitable since some 📄🤚🏼 and of course day trades (many today) closed their positions. 

Now some good news today: 
•iBorrowDesk which reports live data from InteractiveBrokers, which is a huge broker, stopped reporting shares available to be borrowed for shorting @11:00AM. In their FAQ it says when they stop reporting, there are no more shares available to be borrowed. This gives us an idea of how small the number of shares available to borrow for shorting are in the entire market. If they can’t short and we hold the price high, shorts will be paying huge amounts of interest which will eventually lead them to cover their positions which will lead to the short squeeze. 
•Our GME Thread was on the front of Reddit, which means a lot of retards joined us today for sure.
•We showed Melvin and his 🌈🐻‘s that we are ONLY 💎🤚🏼 and buying more shares. I’m sure that after today’s multiple attempts to take us down he’s sweating balls.

The Direxion High Beta 3x Bear ETF was at a high of almost $1200 during the covid crash, and currently sits at around $25.

The ETF was only launched in late 2019, at a price of around $400.

Now the thing I'm trying to understand is - say there's a market crash like 2008 or the covid crash, would HIBS go back to $1000+ levels? Or would that not be possible since it invests in short positions and such and may have lost a lot of money by now?

Final question, how would you play this if you expect a big correction or crash? Buy straight shares, or a long call? (Options only go up to Aug 21 for now)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thanks $BB _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tax free retirement account transfer? Say I have a 401k with $20,000 in it and I have a Roth IRA where I own 100 SPY shares.

At close, SPY $185 calls 1/20 had 0 open interest and volume with a $193.32/$194.03 bid/ask price.

What's stopping me from selling a call in my Roth for $193.68 or $19,368 and then logging into my 401k and buying that call. At expiration, I obviously wouldn't exercise the contract in the 401k and I'd just let it expire. Doing this, I effectively transferred $19,368 from a pre-tax account to a post-tax account without having to pay taxes. I'd obviously much rather have that money grow in my Roth as opposed to my 401k.

&#x200B;

Does this sound doable/legal? I know wash trading is a thing and illegal but from what I understand there has to be some sort of intent to mislead the market by inflating the volume, which isn't really the case here.
