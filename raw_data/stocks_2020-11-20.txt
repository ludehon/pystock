 Stocks and employee benefit correlation? Greetings Fellow Traders,
Recently I have been buying stocks that have taken care of their employees the best during COVID and prior to COVID. It’s amazing that there seems to be a correlation between share price, earnings (duh), and if the company is a “good place to work for”. Amazon is an outlier but think Costco, Google, Zoom, etc. All of these companies are pretty hard to get into. People love to work for Costco. Google is one of the best places to work for. I have family that works at Zoom and they love it. Wondering if anyone else has noticed this correlation? And if there is a metric(s) to follow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Undervalued Stocks Which stocks do we think are undervalued and have room to explode in 2021 & beyond? I am 22 y/o, in graduate school and would like a good start for when I make an expected monthly income. That being said, I dont have time to do much research so I heavily rely on my friends here on reddit. Im currently long on SQ, PINS, CRSR. CRWD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are people so excited about Palantir I have been following Palantir for the past week and I am wondering what makes Palantir so special? Would someone in the comments explain too me why they are so excited to buy into this company over some many others that are also doing well. What makes their service so revolutionary that people are calling them the next apple and Tesla?  Is all of this love for their company justified or is it simple hype?

Further questions:

Is the fact that they make revenue of under a billion but a market cap of about 30 billion a red flag or is this normal?

Who are their competitors and is their product truly that revolutionary?

Also if you can recommend some insightful articles that convinced you too invest it would be much appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Well diversified traders, what is your average daily volatility? I trade just for fun and education on a simulator and I was just wondering what type of daily change a well diversified portfolio sees. I would estimate mine to be about +-1.50% and I am holding about 8 stocks ranging from 2- with about 15 (CCL)- 25% (AAL) portfolio diversity, and the other 6 are safer bets diversified about 8%. Just dumped my stake in LYV and moved most into CCL earlier today.

I’ve been watching a few pretty close and not a lot of movement. ERIC, FIVG(ETF), and NOK are a few I’ve targeted as possible buys.  Please feel free to drop some 5G stocks you believe will see some nice growth. 

The big question I have (that nobody has the answer to) is when do you project will 5G take off?  Do you think it’s all hype that really won’t see tremendous growth. Did 4G have any kind of stock takeoff(I didn’t pay much attention before 4G was around). I know that some autonomous driving functionality will use 5G and with the hype surrounding EV which many have/will have autonomous driving I figure it’s gotta take off at some point._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR hype? Hey guys, in this day and age "hype" aint no joke. When nio and tesla were talked about my all the forums on redit, all my friends both knowledgeable and dumb, and my parents, i should bought into the stock due to such public interest. Hype can make stocks go up and up do such as ways to advertise the stock and social proofing. This time i have noticed the same trend with PLTR, my friends who do not know the difference between market cap and volatility (true lmao) are talking about buying. Just off the hype alone i feel like this will continue to rise, though for me its a swing trade of a month to catch the hype train? Your thoughts?

GameStop needs to take the right steps to cut its excessive real estate costs and hire the right talent. If it does, it will have the resources to begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping, and a truly high-touch experience that will make consumers excited about GameStop.

Lately, the company has seen some promising signs. Last quarter brought an 800% spike in digital sales—bringing online channels to about 20% of GameStop's total revenue. The company also recently announced a deal with Microsoft Corp, through which it will get a cut each time customers use an Xbox purchased at a GameStop store to buy digital-only products.

They have positive cash flow, a total addressable market of $200b, a strong reputable brand with a big userbase (55m Power Player subscribers), 140% short interest, and the man to take them to the house, Ryan cohen.

I'm long Gamestop._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIU Technologies is an underrated EV company. Agree or Disagree? Earnings are on Monday premarket.

They are a part of some ETFs like ARKK though._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Paypal vs Square Stock I’m currently invested in PayPal but I’m considering whether or not square is a better option to invest in. Square probably has more room to grow but PayPal is the bigger company and probably more used. What do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Credit Expansion, which sectors benefited the most and will benefit in the future?  So, since the interest rate started to fall, and mostly from 2000-2020, there was a great credit expansion in the country. It is almost 200% of our gdp, while in 1980 it was like only 100% percent of our gdp. Which sectors benefited the most and will benefit in the future because of this credit expansion?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Telos (TLS) is a no brainer play. Telos that just IPO'd and is trading around 20$ per share is currently sitting just above 1b market cap. This is an established company running for over 50 years. It has ongoing contracts with the government, some which were implemented just this year alone and are already signed for 5 years+ (https://www.telos.com/telos-wins-additional-disa-contract-for-automated-message-handling-system/). 

The company had revenues of 220M in 2019 so it is currently trading at 4-5x revenues. In this market that is nothing, comapnies trade at 100x revenues like it's nothing. This company really looks a lot similar with PLTR and they are currently at 37b market cap. 

Personally I think they are hugely undervalued and the market will react starting from next week.

I’m wondering at what price or when you would recommend planning an exit out of Exxon?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you guys get over FOMO? When I first started earlier this year, it was easy to make money by pretty much buying anything and waiting a week or two. Eventually things got a little more up and down and you had to choose your entry and exit points carefully. 

When that happened I began losing a ton of money due to following my emotions and the “fear of missing out”. For example, I’d buy a stock, get a nice return and sell. Then if I saw it still climbing, I’d buy back in and more often than not I’d lose all my profits. 

Recently, I’ve had a nice strategy where I can drop something in a stock and once I receive 10% gains of whatever my goal is, I’ve been pulling out. But frequently they continue to run up over that. I haven’t bought back in trying to learn from my previous mistakes. But how do I get over the feeling of “if I woulda stayed in I could have made this much” or similar thoughts.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Softbank is preparing for the worst case scenario At the New York Times' DealBook Online Summit (Nov 17-18 2020), Masayoshi Son (CEO of Softbank) said they are preparing for the worst case scenario despite of the incoming covid vaccine. The worst case scenario he laid out is that one major company can go down and create a domino effect in the market. It's unusual for Softbank to be bearish because they are known to buy billions of dollars of call options in big techs, which drives up the prices significantly. He didn't disclose how Softbank arrived at that scenario.

Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.

I bought into some  COVID vaccine stocks over the summer (MRNA, PFE, AZN) and they’ve obviously
been performing very well over the last couple of weeks. Do we think that, once mass distribution is completed and the pandemic has ended, these stocks will regress back to pre-pandemic levels? Or is there reason to believe they will continue to grow in the coming years?

The MRNA vaccine is using new technology that is expected to expedite vaccine production for future pandemic pathogens, so that may be a reason to expect stability and growth. The pandemic might also lead to a renewed interest in eliminating other problematic viruses, like HIV and even seasonal influenza.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best advice I've ever received: "Poor people are buying up toilet paper, rich people are buying up stocks" Back in late Feb early March, I was panicking (like everyone else) after seeing the gains I've made in 2019 disappear. Not knowing wtf was going to happen, I was going to cash out. I called my dad and asked what he thought of the situation. I was surprised/confused when he told me that he sold 2 of his properties and dumped all the money from the sale, as well as most of his savings into assets during that time and he advised me to do the same. I was very skeptical at the time and I was worried I would need the capital with all the shit that was going on- lockdowns, essential needs/food shortages, riots out here in LA. He then told me, "You'll never get an opportunity like this again, poor people are buying up toilet paper, rich people are buying up stocks." I'm definitely not "rich", but I decided to to take his advice and dumped all my liquid assets into the market- around $75k. All I can say is.....thanks Dad._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is BNTX (BioNTech) surging while PFE (Pfizer) is seeing minimal gains on vaccine news? PFE - 30 shares @ 36.82.

BNTX seems to keep surging where PFE lags. They entered a profit-sharing agreement for a 1.95B government contract. BNTX is up 400% on the year whereas PFE is essentially even on the year. My assumption was that the increasingly positive vaccine news would have a significant impact on the PFE share price. Buffet also dumped in a significant investment last week.

The combination of the worldwide growing population and the increasing waste-per-capita generated annually is devastating to our planet. 

It seems as if the current impact of the "green" revolution on the capital market is only with clean energy (mainly solar) and electric battaries. 

I see 3 main waste related fields with a potential uplift in the future (items slighlty overlap):
1. Recyclying.
2. Efficient waste processing.
3. Energy recovery (waste-to-energy).

What are the most relevant stocks for that?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is this a good time to invest in Dodo Airlines? Dodo Airlines ($DAL) stalk price is about half of where it was at the beginning of the year.  I see potential for them to recover if the vaccines work but also short-term risk if another shutdown/lockdown happens.

Possible concerns:

They had a near crash event in the ocean which sent the stalk dropping 8% until news came that the crash was avoided when the pilot remembered they were flying in a sea plane

I also read that an anonymous insider claims a potential lawsuit arising from participation in the utter destruction of several small islands.  Apparently, trees were clear cut without a permit and all vegetation was stripped.  We could be looking at a million bell fine here as well as possible criminal charges.

Possible opportunities:

A new variety of fish was recently discovered during a DAL chartered flight.  This fish is said to be quite valuable and DAL is claiming partial ownership based on some fine print in their flight contract.  A favorable ruling could bring a lot of bells to next quarters earning report

Rumors of an upgraded First-Class Dodo miles ticket which costs more but allows the airline to fly to a new island where there are supposed to be new insects and fish, as well as an inside source claiming the island also contains a new variety of fruit.  If the upgraded first-class dodo tickets get approved, there could be a boon of bells hitting earnings report next quarter.

Stop was at $12.48, but the order was filled at $12.17. Please help if you have experience with this.

TLDR Question 2: How do stop limit orders work? They should only fill shares at prices between my stop price and limit price, right? If the stock moves too fast then it would partially fill the order.

Details: I placed a stop limit @ 9:03AM EST. The stock was trading at $11.25. My stop order had the stop price was 12.48 and my limit price was $12.50. My Order was filled @ 9:21 EST for $12.17. 

When looking at the data, the stock hit $12.49 for 500 shares, but began to drop. Wouldn't I have just bought the 500 shares and no more since the next order was at $12.37?

I thought stop limits worked like this: The broker will start buying once it hit the stop. It will fill shares at prices between my stop and limit price. If the stock is a fast mover, then I only get the shares available in the market for that range. Is this how stop limits work?

&#x200B;

I would call the broker, but I'm afraid that they will take away my profit if it was a mistake.

Still sifting through, but some key insights:

> Historically, our merchants in China have benefitted from lower shipping costs due to the Universal Postal Union Treaty (“UPU”). Certain expected changes to UPU postal rates that went into effect in July 2020 are likely to increase the shipping rates our merchants incur to ship products from China. The actions we have taken in our logistics program to mitigate these increased costs may not be successful over the long term. If there are increases in shipping costs, the sales price of products on our platform could increase, which could reduce the volume of transaction activity on our platform to decrease and may consequently have a negative impact on our results of operations.

With the current climate of our country, many stating a lockdown is inevitable, to other states saying they will not lockdown again, what would you guys suggest investing in?

I had some stock in Boeing which I had bought earlier this year when they dipped to around $170 and made a grand off them but I was leery to hold that stock with possible incoming lockdowns.

I figure airline industry won’t fully recover until a vaccine is 100% at play and distributed. Would you guys recommend investing in airlines anyway? What about the S&P 500? What stocks would you recommend or ETFs?

What would you guys suggest to invest in? I mean for short term and long term. Apple looks promising but with their phones coming out with no charger, and very similar appearance, I’m assuming they’ll continue to negatively snowball.

Should we expect the stock market to dip or decline in the coming months or are we expecting lockdowns?

Key points:

- In the next couple of decades, due to the falling production costs, fossil fuels will continue to lead as the primary energy source, even with the increased investments in, and generation of, renewables. Oil will continue to remain the dominant source for energy for transport while in the heating sector, natural gas will take the lead role. Faster transition resulting in an earlier end of fossil fuel dependence is possible with strong and consistent sustainable development policies and efficient disbursement of investments; but there may not be major renewable projects that can be brought online in the immediate future. Therefore, at the global level, cheaper fossil fuels may continue to support demand and discourage clean energy solutions for some time.

- Major oil and gas companies are observing development of green hydrogen with keen interest. This is also a part of Europe’s green deal package with numerous investment support policies, pilot projects and a dozen roadmaps for using hydrogen for energy.

- Any major government support is likely to be for projects that accelerate the energy transition to a zero carbon emission economy or transition from the fossil fuels industry. The stimulus plans, government support and the post pandemic recovery of China (which leads the solar panels and wind energy sectors) will determine the pace of recovery. Despite government interventions, full recovery may not be possible given that many of the energy related infrastructure projects and related economic activities are shelved or indefinitely postponed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taat Lifestyle /BeyondTabacco Hi,

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I've read some articles like on fool.com and stuff about compounding interest on the stock market and I just don't get it because you don't get any interest when you buy stocks and nothing is reinvested. 

If I have 1 share of apple, it'll either appreciate or depreciate and I'm not earning interest on it and nothing is reinvested. I mean, I guess you could reinvest dividends, but that's the closest thing I can see.

Been into stocks since 1 month now and i don't really know if i should sell stocks with losses.

I have been down quite a bit cause a few BABA stocks i have (keeping those though). Last days i got back up thanks to nio and palantir (classic i know). Still got a good amount in ETF aswell.

And as last stock i have barrick gold corp (20 shares) who seems to drop every day. I am wondering if i should sell these and reinvest in something with more chances on green, or stick with it now that more and more lock downs are initiated.

Please help !_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BYD EV $BYDDF undervalued So BYD is a massive Chinese manufacturer of EV cars, buses, forklifts, Lithium batteries, solar panels
& energy storage modules, and PPE. 

Their revenues have increased significantly (41%) in Q3 for a total of $6.63 billion and net profit of $263 million (1363% increase). Their increase in revenue has been attributed to a significant increase in their EV sales, especially their premium Han EV with their blade battery which allows a range of 376 miles along with an intelligent driving system. They have agreements with Ford and Toyota as a supplier for their EV batteries. They are also the one of the world’s largest manufacturers of PPE, which I am sure is going to continue to be a cash cow for them. 

Berkshire Hathaway has a 25% stake in the company along with smaller stakes by Vanguard and Blackrock. 

Their market cap is currently $61 billion while NIO’s is $66 billion. Just based on BYD’s revenues and profits, it is still quite undervalued at $22.67 pps especially when comparing to other EV companies - many of which have not even reached the production stage of their vehicles.

Admittedly, the pps has run up quite a bit (400%) from June 2020 but I feel that it still has lots of room to climb up. It’s currently in consolidation mode and if the Q4 numbers are just as great, it should continue to climb - especially given the EV hype train.

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big "IF" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on.

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

I'm relatively new.  In my 20s, and inherited my portfolio from my father, who traded it while I was growing up.  I still have a few mutual funds that have been growing, but am curious if the cost basis information is accurate (Fidelity).  I gave Fidelity a call last week to ask them about this, and they basically just said they keep historical transactions & price info for 5 years, and after that it's up to the investor to maintain.  Some of my funds were initially bought in the 90s, so this is going to take me some time to backtrack this.  Most of them have one or two purchases every year, reinvesting the dividends.

Everywhere online, I see people saying the S&P 500 averages 10% yearly returns, and one should expect more like 7% yearly growth in the future. But the SPY index ETF seems to have grown 13% the past year, even with the covid crash, and 75% over the past five years, which would average \~15% growth per year. Is there something I'm missing?

As a side question, it seems there are some other roughly similar indexes like MGK and QQQ which have been seeing even bigger yearly gains.

Hi, I'm asking a question(s) for a friend. I'm a little lacking in all the details but here goes.

So, this person has shares with Lloyds TSB from back when they were named as such. The share certificate was updated a while back to the new name company when they changed the name to just Lloyds, and they just forgot about them.

A few days ago they remembered about them and checked them on Google. When they checked the value they said they were only worth 35 pence a share, and that they were worth virtually nothing. Thinking to myself that it sounded a bit on the low side I checked myself and the value was 35 (gbx), not £0.35p. So I'm thinking they could be worth more. 

I'm a novice at trading and have only really traded/invested on the nasdaq, so dollars is what I'm familiar with. I did notice some people talking about shares in pence in chat forums but were clearly talking about shares that were in pounds, so I'm a little confused. 

My question(s) Are there two different types of stocks for Lloyds, one with a lower value and one with a higher. Or are they reading the share value incorrectly? Or am I? 

Thanks in advance for any help or info.

I realized that it could be better to sell a covered call (without buying more stock) at 50 then it is to put in a conditional limit sell. That way you get the commission independent if the stock hits that price. The con perhaps is that you have to wait until they buy the covered call at >50 to do the trade (or you sell it separately).
