($FIZZ) I recently joined Reddit's stock community and quickly learned about the infamous $GME short squeeze and wanted to learn more about short squeezes given the massive potential returns they represent.

Currently, FIZZ has a short interest of 67.49%, which may not be as high as GME's but is still very significant.

This means any significant price increase would then force further price increases, which may happen as FIZZ is estimated to report earnings on December 10th, 2020. This is notable because FIZZ has beaten on EPS for the last three quarters and beat revenue for two of those quarters. The stock has also gone up on those three occasions (at least in the short term). More broadly, the company and stock seem to in a strong position. The stock is up 86.01% over the year to date and LaCroix is an iconic brand. Given this, could the upcoming earnings report and a potential run-up to it be the catalyst needed for a short squeeze?

Its sales are likely to get a boost from a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, which is causing many people to avoid brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon stock rose on Black Friday.

Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali estimates that Amazon will grab 42% in U.S. e-commerce spending this holiday season. That share, measured in gross merchandise value, is up from 36% last year.

"We're incrementally positive on AMZN going into what should be a blockbuster holiday season, given the company's outsized growth within U.S. e-commerce," Squali said in a note to clients Wednesday.

He reiterated his buy rating on Amazon stock with a price target of 3,650. On the stock market today, Amazon stock rose 0.3% to 3,195.34.

Amazon Seen Outpacing Total E-Commerce Growth

Squali believes Amazon will grow its e-commerce sales in North America by 42% year over year in the fourth quarter.

Meanwhile, Adobe (ADBE) projects that total U.S. online holiday-season spending in November and December will reach $189 billion this year, up 33%. That would be a material acceleration from the same period last year, when sales grew 13.1%.

The Covid-19 pandemic is behind much of the growth, Squali said.

The health crisis "has forced consumers online and away from brick-and-mortar stores, where high density of traffic fuels the transfer of the virus," he said. "In fact, if the current spike in Covid-19 cases continues, and store capacity is further restricted, we believe it would force even more people to order online."

Amazon Stock 'Best Way To Play' E-Commerce Trends

Amazon also is benefiting from near-record retail store closings this year, Squali said. Year to date, there have been 8,325 announced store closures in the U.S. In 2019, the industry saw a record 9,300 store closures, he said.

Amazon stock is the "best way to play" online holiday shopping trends, he said.

Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers and activist groups staged protests and strikes against the e-commerce giant in countries worldwide on Black Friday. They were protesting the company's handling of everything from sick pay and Covid-19 precautions to user privacy and environmental concerns. The protests were coordinated under the Make Amazon Pay campaign.

# Walmart | Save Money - Live Better:

Sector: Consumer Defensive

Walmart is America’s largest retailer by sales, selling a variety of general merchandise and grocery items. It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \~6%, the UK \~6%, and Canada \~4% beings  its largest external markets.

The company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.

Walmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for [nearly half](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png) of all online grocery sales. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.

If you want to see more of their partnership/acquisitions [please look here on page 2.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2019/annual/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf)

**Strengths:**

>\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  
>  
>\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  
>  
>\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  
>  
>\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  
>  
>\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.

**Risks:**

>\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  
>  
>\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  
>  
>\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.

Amazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.

In addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The [wage increase to 15$](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181002005317/en/Amazon-Raises-Minimum-Wage-to-15-for-All-U.S.-Employees-Including-Full-Time-Part-Time-Temporary-and-Seasonal) was much more than them "listening to their critics", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap. ([See the whole diapers deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-quidsi-diaperscom-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos-2020-7)).

# Financial History:

For Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|$478,615|$33,559|$49,994|\~1.5|
|2017|$481,371|$32,884|$45,930|\~1.4|
|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\~1.5|
|2019|$514,405|$32,635|$58,033|\~1.8|
|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\~2.3|

The revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, [they are estimated at 97% annual growth there](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ecommerce-sales-reach-sky-high-growth-in-recent-quarter-2020-8). However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.

The debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|
|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|
|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|

Cash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.

Over the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Walmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$151.60|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|21.89|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|
|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|

Strictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.

From a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.

From a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):

>\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  
>  
>\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  
>  
>\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  
>  
>\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  
>  
>\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  
>  
>\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?

There are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.

# Closing Thoughts:

Walmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.

Ultimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.

At the end of it all, you need to ask yourself, do you think Walmart can continue compete, and continue to work its current business model? Or perhaps you'd take more the side of why not both?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views, read up on Target and Amazon. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

Market Order – An immediate order to be executed at the prevailing market price.

Limit Order – A conditional order to buy or sell, but only at a certain price, in an attempt to protect a potential profit or minimize a loss. Buy limit orders are entered with instructions to place the trade at or below a certain price. Likewise, sell limit orders contain instructions to execute the trade at or above a specific price.

Stop Quote Order –Investors generally use a stop quote order to either limit a loss or protect a gain on a security. A sell stop quote order is placed at a stop price below the current market price and will trigger if the national best bid quote is at or lower than the specified stop price. A buy stop quote order is placed at a stop price above the current market price and will trigger if the national best offer quote is at or higher than the specified stop price. Once triggered, a stop quote order becomes a market order (buy or sell, as applicable), and execution prices can deviate significantly from the specified stop price.

Stop Quote Limit Order – Investors generally use a stop quote limit order to either limit a loss or protect a gain on a security. A stop quote limit order combines the features of a stop quote order and a limit order. A sell stop quote limit order is placed at a stop price below the current market price and will trigger if the national best bid quote is at or lower than the specified stop price. A buy stop quote limit order is placed at a stop price above the current market price and will trigger if the national best offer quote is at or higher than the specified stop price. Once triggered, a stop quote limit order becomes a limit order (buy or sell, as applicable) at a specified limit price, and execution may not occur as the market price can move away from the specified limit price.

> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Use stock short borrow rate and availability to trade I recently read some article regarding short squeeze, which opened me eyes on the other side of the trade. I notice some stocks have much higher borrow rate and lower availability, it seems to me there are higher shorting volume. 

For experienced trader, can you help me to understand a few things

1. Should I buy put option for stocks with high borrow rate, since there is big money betting it going down?
2. For stocks with higher borrow rate, but jumped recently ( up for more than 5 days), are these opportunity for short squeeze or really the high before the dump
3. Is borrow rate a good indicator for sentiment, similar to put/call ratio_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should you invest in a company where the CEO has a sexual harassment case active against him, but it seems obvious the company will do well? **TLDR:** Was looking to invest in Unity (Ticker: $U), but an outstanding sexual harassment case against 10 employees at the firm including the CEO has made me pause, and I'm reflecting on how morals/ethics plays into the world of investing.

\--- 

I have recently been doing a lot of research into the company: Unity Technologies (Ticker: $U). Unity is a platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content in gaming, and they're expanding to other industries like automobiles, architecture/construction, retail marketing, etc. They IPO'd about 3 months ago, and they're already up over 150%. I was feeling super excited to invest in this company when I suddenly found a pretty shady and hushed-up sexual harassment case against the top management in the company. 

**Some quick facts about the company (pretty much just from their S-1):**

* 1.5M MAU
* **50%+** of ALL mobile games, PC games, and console games are made using Unity
* 15K new projects made per day
* 190+ countries have Unity creators
* Revenues have grown by approx. 40% YoY over the past 2 years, and they aggressively invest into R&D and S&M to support further expansion in gaming and other industries
* They've made strategic acquisitions (Vivox, deltaDNA, Artomatix, etc.), and all evidence shows signs of really knowing their market and having a clear roadmap. 

**The sexual harassment case and employee data monitoring concerns:** 

In 2019, a woman named Anne Evans, who was the former VP of global talent acquisition, filed a lawsuit against Unity involving 10 members of Unity who were not all disclosed in the filing, but the most important of whom was the current CEO, John Riccitiello. 

In the lawsuit (which anyone can find with a quick google search about sexual harassment at Unity), Riccitiello allegedly made several sexual advances over the years she was at the firm. There is one instance where he apparently lures her into his hotel room, and bluntly expresses that he wants to engage in intercourse with her. She manages to find a way out of the situation, and the next day, he pulls her aside to explain that any word of what happened will lead to her career being ruined. 

A couple/few years seem to go by, and in February of 2019, Unity sends out a company-wide survey about receiving feedback to improve culture. Anne Evans (and supposedly some other colleagues as well) anonymously report in the survey that they don't feel like they have anyone to go to, to express their concerns. **Here is why:** the Chief People Officer (basically the head of HR) was a woman named Elizabeth Osterman Brown who was and had been romantically involved with Riccitiello. The nature of their relationship before wasn't clear, but we know they're engaged now **because it's disclosed in the S-1 that Unity filed.** There is a "Separation Agreement" for the former CPO (Elizabeth Brown), in which Unity was charged a one-time **$13.5M stock-based compensation expense** that seems to have been given to her. It's unclear why she was pushed out of the company, especially before IPO, but Riccitiello and Brown were engaged (as of October of 2020), so I'm not sure it matters.

Evans was approached about her responses to this company-wide survey by two other women who are part of Unity's HR team, Natalie Mulay (Head of Americas Recruiting) and Christine Kerr (Brown's assistant). They knew the contents of the survey results despite the fact that they shouldn't have access to that information. Evans reported that Mulay and Kerr had access to this survey to Brown and an investigation was launched. Mulay was furious, and she threatened to accuse Evans of sexual harassment herself (they had had a brief consensual relationship in 2016). Mulay for some reason quit Unity briefly, but Unity reps convinced her to swiftly come back. Eventually, Mulay did actually file a sexual harassment complaint against Evans, and there was another investigation, in which at the end all charges against Evans were dropped.

**However,** from the investigation, Unity said they were **terminating Evans' employment at Unity because there was evidence she had 'wrongfully accepted gifts' from Mulay years earlier**. Evans was surprised because she knew that Riccitiello had bought Brown a $40,000 watch, a $3M house in Pleasanton, California, and more. Soon after her termination, she sued Unity, and of course, Unity has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. 

\---

**Here's my problem:** Unity ($U) is a great company. They're clearly doing amazing things for gaming, and they will likely do very well. On the other hand, this lawsuit really makes Riccitiello look bad. I think it's incredibly unlikely that there is any outcome of this lawsuit that jeopardizes Unity's chances of success given that the case is headed for forced arbitration. However, morally, this investment feels wrong. I know that in the end it's really a matter of personal morals and decision-making. It's also not at all confirmed that all these allegations are even true, but something in my gut tells me there's something kind of messed up that happened here (I could be totally wrong of course). 

**How you can help:** I would just love to hear how you think about these potentially ethically/morally difficult situations when it comes to investing. I know many people think ethics/morals have no place in the world of investing, but I'm really curious to hear how other people thing about these things._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What really happened March 18th, massive profit shift or just normal panic selling for world leading management companies? Seems like this year people with massive amounts of cash and were tuned into the market could have and maybe did double or triple their last 10 years of earnings, playing with house money.  


Uber is now 40eurs, on the 18th it was 17eur. A 800 million US dollar Gov contract in in the final stages of being complete.   


But overall the bounce back happened fast for that majority of stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking at copper stocks that have potential... But need help! I am a noob when it comes to mining stocks! I'll try my best to give good points.

With the recent surge in demand for copper to produce electric vehicles, this wouldn't be a bad futures bet, would it? I know that soon after Elon tweeted about the need for copper in EVs, the price of copper jumped to all time highs. Currently it sits at 3.30$ (or so) per pound which is a significant increase. Of course, if you were to look at a chart of the copper price per pound, it is most definitely volatile so there is some risk. 

I'm not really sure about any other promising copper mining companies or stocks that could take off, but there must be, no? 

The one company I do know of is the biggest producer of copper in the world, FCX (Freeport-McMoRan). Their 52 week low came back in March at around 5$/share and since has climbed pretty steadily to where it's at now at 23.50$/share. Another thing that's pretty attractive about FCX is their close-to 1% dividend payout.

With the new demand for copper and being one of the world's biggest producers of this material, is FCX the best option to put your money into? Are there any others that I should be aware of? 

Sorry if it's a little messy but I'm really intrigued by a futures bet on copper.

Cheers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top Investment Advisors never recommend the same stock Have you ever noticed that? 

After reading through dozens of lists recommending different stocks, made by some of the most recognisable names in the field, I've never seen two list the same stock. Which, I think, is strange isn't it? If those top advisors are going by the numbers, or assessing the future performance of different stocks properly, then shouldn't at least a few of those advisors come to a similar conclusion with their results?

Shouldn't at least five advisors from, let's say, one hundred suggest RollsRoyce or Microsoft for a great growth stock (Examples of course).

I was thinking about that because, hypothetically, if more than two Advisors recommended the same stock between the three of them, (taking into account each advisor might use separate means of reaching their answer) then shouldn't that be a bonafide investment strategy for anyone to follow? If three or five or ten "share market geniuses" come to the same answer, then surely that's the closest anyone's gonna get to guaranteed money?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Additional DD on Tattooed Chef So, I know you probably saw the title and thought "okay, not this again" or "oh great, another pump post." This is not intended to do such. Full disclosure - I am long TTCF with commons and warrants. I just want to present some information here that many may not know about the company. Had the privilege to view a recent webinar with the company. The webinar is property of the presentor, so you won't able to find it available publicly. 

Sam Galletti, CEO of the Tattooed Chef, has 35 years of experience in the food industry. He had a hand in the rise of the Pop Chips brand and eventually sold that business. The company that is now Tattooed Chef, Inc. began as a vegetable importer. They began producing private label items and had great success in doing so. The company maintains a private label producer for Trader Joe's and Aldi. Many folks are eating Tattooed Chef products and don't know it: cauliflower crust pizza, riced cauliflower, açai bowls to name a few. The company is now the largest producer of riced cauliflower in all of Europe. But I digress.

Recent critics of the company (and stock) have pointed to low gross margins and a lack of marketing/advertising. Private label items have lower margins, while branded sales bring higher profit margins. The Tattooed Chef brand, created by CEO's daughter Sarah Galletti, was launched in 2017. Aside from a one-time $1.5M CostCo promotion in the summer, they have spent nothing on marketing. All marketing efforts have been grassroots. The company is still projecting to be on track to acheive record $149M revenue for 2020, with a $17.2M EBIDTA. 

Onto the advertising, or currently lack thereof. A 15% off any bundle Black Friday promotion e-mail was blasted to existing Tattooed Chef customers. Not quite mass marketing. However, the company has partnered with the NitroC Group for a marketing "blitsz" that's set to commence in January 2021. According to the CEO, this campaign will penetrate digital/radio and include some television presence. Two billion 6-second impressions will be blasted throughout the first eight months of 2021. As Mr. Gallettii put it, "people will know the Tattooed Chef name."

The introduction of the Tattooed Chef name will be strategically kicked off ahead of the company's expansion to traditional grocery retailers. The company's plant-based offerings have been thoroughly vetted via the club channels: Sam's Club and CostCo. To sell in club, a company needs to move 40-50 units per week. Tattooed Chef has been able to meet this standard set by club retailers. It was recently announced that the company has SKU's available in 50% of US Walmart. In June of 2020, they only had a 7% presence. Target has added two SKU's from Tattooed Chef, the smoothie bowls, to roughly 25% of their stores. Mr. Galletti has stated sales at Target are doing "super good" and the company is offering additional products to the retail giant.

The expansion to traditional grocery retailers will be done via a partnership with distributor KeHE, whose network includes 30,000 retailers and is contracted with Sprouts Farmers Markets and Albertsons.

Let's not forget the products. The company has developed its own plant-based pepperoni and is currently working on products that don't exist in the current market. No more was said of what that may be. However, Galletti has stated plans for ambient products -- shelf-stable snacks, bars, etc. They are expected sometime in 2021. I won't delve into the current offerings, as information and further details about those are already widely available.

To me, it appears there is much room for growth here. I continue to add to my position. I realize the bearish short-term downtrend. But, like I said, I just wanted to share this information. 

TLDR - Company's gross margins expected to increase as branded sales go up with increase in distribution channels. Brand has not been blasted via mass marketing yet. It will be more than just frozen food. Think Amy's Organic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I screwed with holding BLPH bag? Been holding BLPH expecting some return, but all it’s done is continue to go down.

Currently oil is cheap, while natural gas is hot right now ([https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/natural-gas-price](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/natural-gas-price)).

I have currently diversified my oil/gas portfolio into XOM,OXY,COP,RDS based on their risk profile (i.e. some have higher debts and earlier debt maturities than others, while some also engage more into natural gas business besides oil). These stocks have historically also paid high dividends (some still do).

Since the March crash I’ve posted every now and then about JWN and most people have been telling me to not bother with JWN (check my previous post if curious) but here I am currently very much in the green. My avg buy price is ~15 and it’s currently at 26.73. I sold about 17 % at 29.4 for tax reasons but plan on holding the rest possibly through all of 2021. 

I see more positive news ahead - distribution of vaccines, ongoing increase of immunity, headlines reporting fewer people getting infected and bigger numbers of people getting the vaccine, no more shutdowns, less unemployment, big spending as people don’t fear the future, reinstated dividends etc. 

But what do you think? JWN for the last 6 months has dived/crashed pretty much following every single spike/rally but this time I think it’s different. People officially believe the pandemic is ending.

Thanks, all_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does one pick stocks? The wiki says things like fundamental analysis and technical analysis help, but what are you actually looking for? Hello,

19m college student working - fully funding roth ira (since this year) and I have some money from survey sites to play around with (prolific and user testing)

Obligatory sorry because this has most definitely been asked a million times. Currently I'm just indexing with a TDF in a roth ira, but in my brokerage I think it could be good to learn to pick individual stocks. Currently I know on the technical side momentum usually carries a stock higher, but that's about it. On the fundamental side I know a bit more, lower PE ratio (compared with sector) is usually good, you generally want the company to be profitable, you want to see earnings increasing year by year and also maybe dividends rising (as long as company is earning enough to offset the dividend). 

My core question is, how do you get from the point of discovering a stock, (I've found a few I like, like AMAT, and INTC, and also know of the usual players like DIS, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, APPL, etc.) to pulling the trigger? I only have around 200-300$ to play around with so it's not a huge deal if I lose it to learn, but how do I assess whether a stock is a good buy or not. It seems like institutional advice is near worthless.

Again sorry for the repetitive question, but I really want to be confident in my decisions regardless of whether the amount is great or not.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any reason to sell out ENB? I have about 2k invested in ENB which makes about 15% of my portfolio (Yes I have a small portfolio) . After about 3 months of dip, I am almost break even on the stock now and was wondering if its time to sell it. I have another 2 years time horizon and was looking for some advice on this stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Would you rather hold equity or make options plays? Kind of a dumb question. But I've been leveraging equity to some profit for a little bit, and I see the folks over at WSB just printing money on meme stock calls. Wouldn't  the risk/reward be about the same on some of these calls? Its not really something I want to get into but I would at least like to better understand the fundamentals._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Don't see much about Digital Turbine on her (APPS) Been in this since early March and it's been sort of my golden gem of my portfolio, being the first stock I did my own DD and been successful on. It has a very strong business model and seems to be poised to continue growing with future advancements in phone technology. They've shown very promising results their last few earnings and I don't think it gets the recognition it deserves. I can see it rise to $100 by the end of 2021. What are y'all's thoughts on it?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NFLX - Good Entry? Fell from $560 to $460 recently. Looks pretty bullish now and seems like it’s recovering. New lockdowns in L.A and other areas announced today. COVID-19 tailwinds. Bottom of channel and looks good from a technical perspective. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CRM Salesforce - Hold Through Earnings? Worth it for a lottery play here? Recently dropped big on Slack acquisition news so cheap entry. Last time Salesforce had earnings they beat eps by 115.91% and went from $209 to $272 in a day. They also have made investments into $SNOW and other companies that have done exceptionally well. Can we expect to see similar results?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What will happen when TSLA joins the S&P? I know that Vanguard, Blackrock and others usually don't change their portfolios. But on the day that TSLA joins the S&P, will they have to build a position on a company that is larger than Berkshire Hathaway in just one day? I mean, if it's true they are literally delivering money from VIX, SPX and other investors and giving it to TSLA investors.

It's too weird to be true.

Am I missing something here?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Curve Ball: Name BORING stocks Name companies that work in boring industries but are rock solid and can still offer growth to investors.

This sub has it flaws BUT it can also be great for ideas.

So talk to me, let’s discuss BORING companies that can still offer rewards to an investor. 

I am talking elevators, waste, funeral services level of boring.

GO!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stop-limit Orders Hello guys. I am new to investing. I am thinking of putting stop-limit loss orders on all my stocks near the price I paid for the stocks. If a stock abruptly goes down, I hope to break even and rebuy at a lower price. 

What do you think about this strategy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Virgin Galactic SPCE recent rise is only the beginning I mean if you do your research you will find out they ASSUMING they can have a successful test flight, get FAA certification, fly Branson, have good reviewed from paying customers, start commercial operations AND and most importantly scale the business beyond one spaceport in New Mexico this stock should easily have a $50 billion market cap or $250 share price based on forward future revenue and PE ratio in line with a growth company.

Don’t get me wrong there are risks, but rescheduling the flight because of Covid is different then rescheduling because of engineering issues.

Also this is not a pump and dump, selling after the test flight won’t make sense.  As even after the test flight who would want to sell with so many more positive catalysts coming up that I mentioned above.

Better get in, unless you honestly don’t believe in the company ._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Salesforce why do people assume Salesforce is going to pay WORK in shares or a lump sum of cash up front? 

In my opinion, I’d wager they take out a $20B loan with $5B down five or take and finance the remaining amount over 15-20 years at maybe 1.4-2% interest. 

Why would they do this? Because WORK could easily just become extra cash flow for the company, most definitely within 5 years but I’d put money on them being able to profit net cash flow within 2 years tops. 

Can anyone rebuttal my argument on this? Acquisitions are a massive reason why Salesforce is such a dominate company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forbes Market Overvaluation - Thoughts? www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2020/08/18/us-stock-market-hits-record-77-overvalued/amp/

My only current holding is a small position in Aphria. I’m leaning towards An ETF, so far looking at tickers YOLO and TOKE.  Any insights on these or others appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I have a Roth IRA to invest in stocks instead of a regular checking bank account? Sorry if I'm asking a dumb question but I was talking investmenting in stock with my cousin that lives in Canada and he asked me if I had tax-free savings account to put my earnings from stocks I don't pay tax for it, I was very confused as I've never heard of that and he insists that there has to be something like that here in the US.

So in my Google search I found that Roth IRAs are kind of like what he's talking about but to me that's just like 401k, a savings account for retirement which cannot be used until you're old, maybe I'm wrong on that.

My questions is, is there a way to do what cousin says? Pay less or no tax on earnings from investing in stocks with a especial type of bank account? Should I try to open an Roth IRA for this purpose?



TL;DR should I use a Roth IRA to invest and pay less to no taxes like Canadians do with tax free savings accounts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Put for a stock that delisted  Does anyone know what happens to a put when the stock gets delisted and goes OTC?

Or is the put worthless?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNOW Snowflake’s lockup period is due to expire on December 16 where company employees will be able to sell up to 25% of their shares. 

I was originally anticipating that they hype on SNOW would run out after their drop from over 300 shortly after IPOing but their price point shows no signs of dropping. 

I’m hoping to buy in after the price drops to a more reasonable valuation hopefully somewhere after the lockup period. 

What are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Softbank is considering selling Boston Dynamics to Hyundai for 1 billion dollars. [Popular Mechanics article](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a34632830/hyundai-boston-dynamics-walking-cars/)

Hyundai unveiled the walking car concept at an electronics show in 2019.

"CNET's Roadshow said at the time, the car is capable of driving at highway speeds, climbing five-foot walls, and stepping over five-foot wide chasms, rendering it as "basically an AT-AT from Star Wars."" 

Spot the robot dog, born out of BD, has traveled through radioactive zones and worked on oil rigs. Hyundai hopes to use the tech for search and rescue response.

Thoughts? Would the US government allow this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ are popular ETFs the only thing that work for this? im looking for stocks that will safely go up a little bit without being really risky and just trying to go on a moon mission overnight and risking losing a lot of money. 

is there any stocks that just safely go up a little bit at a time or are ETFs like sp500 the only option for that? i dont think i really have enough to dump right now to where getting 10-20% a year will really help much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ETFs for weed, EV and Fintech Hey all looking for some guidance on 3 industries...EV, marijuana and fintech.

Any suggestions or POvs would be appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much of digital advertising is a bubble fueled by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN? The impetus for this question is a two-part Freakonomics podcast, "Does Advertising Actually Work?" In these episodes, the host discusses several flavors of advertising, including newspaper, TV and digital ads, the latter which has the largest implications for some of our highest performing companies over the past year. It's clear that this question is hard to answer - there is so much market inertia and business pressures hindering a thorough exploration of the topic, but nonetheless Stephen Dubner is able to present the case of eBay that showed that paid-search advertising has practically no impact on sales. 
Of course digital advertising is important for less mainstream companies who are trying to establish their brand, and micro-targeting consumers is very effective, but that accounts for a fraction of what is spent on these ads globally. Why are giants like Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Kroger still spending so much on ads for products that we all know, and how many hundreds of billions of dollars can they save if they were to conduct their own investigation only to find that these ads have almost no impact on sales? And how would the fallout from these studies affect the digital ad business, which is dominated by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN in the U.S.?

I have about 30-40k I want to to throw into some ETFs or mutual funds for the long term (20 years or so). I have it currently in a high interest savings account but that rate has bombed in the past 2 years to like 0.5 percent, so now I’m looking to move it to something different.

I’ve been looking into some of the vanguard funds and am interested in VTSAX. Is it a safe play to just literally throw all of my money at that? Or should I buy into multiple funds?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you think NET has topped off for now? I bought 3 shares  at 39$ (i'm poor lol, but at 16 yrs age, its a start)  and have made just over 100$ from it after today. the problem is that i never expected this much growth in such a short period of time, and now am kind of lost because i was trying to think long term, but its skyrocketed in less then 3 months.. this has happened with alot of my holdings..

I buy into them thinking that i'll keep it for a year or two and then in two months its up 50%+. its just weird because i want to hold long term.
