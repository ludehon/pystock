 Investing.com price $change and %price change make ZERO SENSE So if you hover over you icon/avatar there is a portfolio feature where you can add stocks then customize the resulting table to show the last price, previous close, low, high, and bid/ask.   You can also add a change ($) and %Changel column to the table, but the problem is there values make zero sense.

I wanted to share this so I could maybe get some feedback. I hope this can also inspire some other people.

The first part of why I am a trader, my strenghts and weaknesses was left out here, since this is personal and in my opinion differentiates from person to person.

If you would like, I could send you a helpful guideline document, which goes very in depth on the subject of how to create a trade plan. Just contact me :)

# 1 Times of trading

I will only trade on days when I am alone and with a free schedule to have a clear mind. I will be guided by my trading plan and I will adhere to it rigidly. It will help to prevent me from making trades that are poorly conceived and executed, i.e., trades that are based on gut feeling and motivated by fear and/or greed.

I will not trade on days I am mentally instable or distracted.

# 2 Trading long term Goals

My annual trading goal is to ensure I keep my edge over the market. Therefore, I review my market strategy. I then monitor my decisions and Progress in that strategy applied to the market. I then evaluate If my trading edge is still profitable. I improve in the field of evaluating a stock based on Ratios and Statements. I then learn to apply this knowledge to predict a company's intrinsic value. I get educated on when a certain stock is not fitting anymore in my strategy. I keep on reading upon my companies and important technologies and changesets in their markets and then want to be able to predict the results of these changes in my stocks future value and performance. I want to do weekly checkups to see how I might need to reallocate my money or what to dollar cost average into.

# 3 Trading short term goals

I stick to my risk and managing principles defined in this Plan, execute Trades rationally after this defined strategy and avoid trades that do not meet my criteria. I try to stick to my rules of when to trade. I evaluate truly whether I really need to purchase this brand-new thing (Flatscreen Tv), because I could rather invest this money into my portfolio and make long term gains.

# 4 What Instruments will I trade?

I will invest in Stocks of Blue-chip companies which are good viable performers (in the S & P 500 or other indexes). I also invest in Cryptocurrencies. I will not Trade Call or put options as that comes down to gambling.

# 5 My risk attitude

I am risk averse; hence I invest in valuable companies, which keep their price regardless of the stock's price. I only risk small amounts of money in risky trades that I can afford to lose which is 1-3% of my capital. These give me the opportunity to improve in active managing.

# 6 Strategy Risk and review

When my strategy reaches a low of 45% I will stop trading immediately and revise my strategy. I will then according to my new evaluations either cut losses and redistribute or I will hold on because I found a new approach.

# 7 Probability of a successful trade

Assess the number of profitable trades relative to the number of unprofitable ones. Then divide successful trades through all trades. For this calculation I set the bar of a successful trade to be at least a 10% gain in Profit each year if the value or capita increase was expected in that time frame.

# 8 Risk vs Reward

I document my trades and then divide the average capital gained through the average of lost and gained.

# 10 Money management

I will only trade with money that I do not depend on. It is money that is set aside from everyday expenses and if I lose it, it will not degrade my standard of living. If I lose my capital I will not commence trading again until I have thoroughly studied the cause of my failure and understand what I need to change in my strategy to achieve success. My gains in capital I will redistribute in my Portfolio.

In my Dividend high value company strategy, I Dollar cost average in every Month 8% of my reserve capital. This means every week I invest 2% of my whole capital, If the situation is assessed extra profitable, I will allocate more in that moment ex: 6%.

# 11 Golden Trading Principles

1. Understanding and being confident in a company.
2. A share is an actual piece of ownership.
3. Investing at a reasonable Price
4. Recognize the market is a pendulum.

It Swings from pessimism to optimism.

5. Buy from the pessimists sell to the optimists.

Pessimism is \~ below average by 50+%. Optimism is \~ above average by 50+%.

6. Do not cut losses when I made a good investment in the first place, hold on.

7. I make my money when I buy not when I sell.

I know the value and at what price I will be able to sell in the future, so I already made my money after buying.

8. Excitement in a stock/sector is not sustainable.

9. Price of a stock is not value of a company.

If the Value exceeds the price: buy if the price exceeds the value: sell.

10. Do not trade emotionally.

11. Never chase losses, trying to make them back up.

12. There is always a risk of being wrong.

13. Value does not result in the price of the share.

It is determined by price and demand.

14. Do my own due diligence, do not rely on others.

15. Stick to your Principles and trade plan no matter what.

Accordance to the strategy is more important than the output.

16. Protect and preserve capital.

Focus on how much I can lose and how I can keep losses to a minimum and not on what money can I make.

17. Plan the trade – trade the plan.

# 12 Trading Setup

In my dividend value investing will invest in stocks when the market is down. I will choose my stocks after the following guidelines: these must be met to a high extent in order for me to take them into consideration for a timed investment (market down/undervalue opportunity).

The company must have:

· dominance

· a simple, free cash flow

· high barrier for entry into that market (It is not possible to easily come into this market as a Kickstarter. Ex. A lot of intellectual or $ capital is needed. The company has a lot of patents on things.)

· high returns on invested capital (ROIC +2% more than WACC)

· limited exposure to external risk: sustainability

o Research long term threats that could make them go out of business: competition, other products, innovations in tech that replaces their business model.

· strong balance sheets

o Total Assets / Liabilities Ratio > 1 (More Assets than Liabilities)

o Current Assets / Liabilities Ratio > 1 (More Assets than Liabilities)

o Debt/Equity: >1 lower the better

o Good Credit Score

· not rely on capital to survive.

· low reinvestment costs

· little to no controlling shareholders

· Excellent Management:

o Management that sticks to its company for a long time

o Check Proxy statement

o Good mission statement: goals for management, employees, stockholders, partners

o CEO's in the same industries have similar compensations.

o Financial Statement notes

For this portfolio, the stock should have:

· A Divided yield raise history for 25+ Years.

· Moderate to high dividends pay 2.5-4%

· Low Prices: PE Ratio low compared to competitors in industry.

I must understand the following of a company through thorough research in order to be confident in my evaluation:

· The business model of this company: its strategy, its values (for investors and the company: pioneer, leader, sustainability).

· Their current activities (development, innovation, manufacturing)

· Their field and branches they are active in.

· Their partners (Suppliers, Associations, projects)

· Recent purchases of companies or assets and whether that was a valuable move in the right direction.

· Their key resources (Ex: Intellectual property, facilities)

· Their revenue streams (Sale of goods, intellectual property)

Compromising on my Principles and diverging in a countervailing quality will bring only harm. If the companies in the portfolio sway from these guidelines and there is not future prediction that this could change in foreseeable time, then I will do the following according to the situation: If there is Profit to be made because of a volatile high, I will sell these stocks and take the gains. If the stock is down, I will hold on to the shares and sell them on break even because it is not realistic that because of volatility the share price will see an increase. I will cut losses or take gains and redistribute in my portfolio or acquire a new stock in that market that performs and fits the requirements better.

My Portfolio will incorporate 10-13 high quality stocks.

The Markets I invest in are diverse and all meet the criterion of my companies:

· Essential businesses (Hardware stores, pharmacies, industries that can't easily, and short term be replaced)

· Tech industries (Engineering inventions : Drones, travel etc.)

· Healthcare innovation (Research and development in Medicaments, vaccines, treatments)

· Essential goods (Electrical supply companies etc.)

· Software (Companies that focus on large scale innovations for business solutions such as cloud computing (long term stability))

# 13 How do I find my setup stocks?

I research companies in Index funds of the top performers in the USA and then pick out the ones that meet my initial criteria and fit into the sectors of my portfolio.

# 14 When will I enter a trade?

I consider a trade when the research on my stock has been done and it meets all my criteria, and the future development has been assessed in favor. I will enter the trade when the Dividend stock has reached a point that is at least 60% lower than the fluctuation highs of this stock in a time of 3 Months.

# 15 After Trading

I will document in my trading journal the entry and exit point of my trade, as well as my duration and one key lesson learnt. When a stock is sold, I will then review my trade journal and compare it to my trade plan and draw conclusions whether I deviated from my strategy or if my strategy Is not refined enough. After a trade I remind myself that the important thing is, that the trade was executed in accordance to the trading plan and not the profitable outcome of that trade. After Trading a loss or gain I evaluate my state of mind to ensure that I am calm, relaxed and ready to enter the market again with an unemotional and professional attitude ensuring I act in accordance of my trade Plan.

These questions can be reflected upon:

· Did I do everything right; was the trade well planned and executed?

# 16 Discipline

The test to this comes when the stocks are down, not when they are up.

If I break one of my commandments in this trade plan I will not trade for the following week and focus on my reasons why there was a breach in discipline._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD DD THANKS TO GME=GG You respectable people forget that AMD is posting their earnings report on the 26th which is 4 days away and that every single Gamestop ran out of PS5's and Xboxes to sell and guess how many of those PS5's and Xboxes have AMD based Cpus and Gpus (hint: all of them do buddy).

After weeks of internal U.S. government deliberation, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent—the Chinese internet giants also known as the “BAT”—will remain available to American investors. The companies are symbols of China’s economic modernity and growth but are also accused of having links to the Chinese military and state surveillance efforts. 

On Jan. 7, reports surfaced that Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent might be included on the Trump administration’s growing list of entities off-limits to American investment. A week later, the companies were officially spared. 

Recent reporting suggests that the Treasury Department’s concerns over investor sentiment and economic ripple effects outweighed the State Department’s and Pentagon’s worries about Chinese civil-military “fusion.” While American entities owned only a tiny fraction of most of the companies banned so far, U.S.-based investors own one-third of Alibaba and 12 percent of Tencent. U.S. investors have poured $1.4 trillion into those two companies alone. The companies’ exclusion from the list may demarcate the upper bound of domestic dislocation that the Trump administration was willing to weather to exclude Chinese entities from U.S. markets. 

The considered action against Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent stemmed from the executive order Trump signed on Nov. 13, 2020, prohibiting American investment in a group of Chinese companies alleged to have inappropriate ties to the Chinese military. Compliance with the order has been confused, in part because of the vague criteria and subsequent Treasury Department memoranda. (Bill Bishop, author of the China-watchers’ newsletter Sinocism, described the administration’s last few weeks of China policy as “a driverless clown car careening into a ditch.”) The effects of the administration’s decision-making process were on display in the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE’s) attempt to comply with Treasury guidance. On Dec. 31, the NYSE announced that it would delist Chinese telecom companies’ American depositary receipts (ADRs), one mechanism by which U.S. investors can easily own foreign stocks. The NYSE reversed itself and then, a day later, reversed once more: The exchange finally halted trading of China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom on Jan. 11, and U.S. banks delisted their derivatives. 

Since November, the list has grown to include some companies without direct military ties but with varying degrees of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) affiliation. Xiaomi, the world’s third-largest mobile phone manufacturer, is among the latest additions to the list of entities from which Americans are required to divest. Xiaomi’s ties to the Chinese military are less well documented than other banned firms’. 

A recently drafted executive order would have expanded the criteria to any company under the “control and influence” of the CCP. Given China’s state capitalist system, that would be a rather long list. The order was not signed prior to the expiration of Trump’s term.

On Jan. 9, Beijing issued new guidance to Chinese firms, prohibiting them from complying with foreign sanctions that are “unjustified.” President Biden’s team will have to decide whether to reverse, maintain or expand the Trump administration’s exclusions of Chinese companies.

U.S. Declassifies Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific

In its last days, the Trump administration declassified its 2018 “Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific,” 21 years ahead of schedule. On Jan. 5, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien ordered the declassification of the 10-page document, which outlines goals, interests and “lines of effort” to serve American interests in the region. 

Publicly released on Jan. 12, the framework posited that top security threats include Beijing’s attempt to “dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics, and harness them in service of authoritarianism.” According to the framework, “Chinese dominance in these technologies would pose profound challenges to free societies.” (Left unstated is what such “dominance” entails.) Another technological threat noted in the strategy is “China’s proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations.” In response, the United States adopted the objective of “maintain[ing] American industry’s innovation edge vis-a-vis China.”

According to analysts of Sino-American relations, the U.S. framework was informed and driven in part by the China strategies of U.S. allies and partners, particularly Japan, Australia and India. One expert argues that while the document reveals the existence of a multifaceted U.S. strategy toward China, Trump’s actions often defied the strategy outlined in the document. Commentators view the declassification as an attempt to entrench Trump’s tough-on-China stance, making it more difficult for President Biden to shift course.

In a regular press conference on Jan. 15, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry called the declassification of the framework an attempt to “smear and contain China and undermine regional peace and stability.”

Chinese Tech Worker Deaths Spark Outcry on Working Conditions

The recent deaths of two employees of Pinduoduo, a Chinese e-commerce giant, sparked widespread public outcry against the cultures of overwork that exist in Chinese technology companies and start-ups. On Dec. 29, a Pinduoduo worker in her 20s collapsed while walking home with colleagues in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang. Pinduoduo later confirmed her death but did not disclose the cause. On Jan. 5, a Pinduoduo worker in Changsha, Hunan province, died by suicide after asking for time off from the company. And a former Alibaba employee self-immolated in protest over unpaid wages. The video of his self-injury has gone viral on Chinese social media in recent days. 

Another former Pinduoduo employee claims he was fired after posting a photo of a colleague being carried into an ambulance on Jan. 7. (Pinduoduo disputes the reason for the firing.) The photo and the employee’s associated claims of harsh work requirements went viral on Weibo, reigniting public criticism of the Chinese tech sector’s controversial “996” work culture. The term “996” refers to the tacit expectation that employees work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. The 996 office schedule has been endorsed by tech billionaires including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and JD.com chief Richard Liu, who view the practice as necessary for survival in a highly competitive industry. But the Chinese public, particularly younger generations, are critical of the culture of overwork. 

A hashtag about the Pinduoduo employees’ deaths drew more than 260 million views on Weibo. Chinese state media, rather than cracking down on public backlash against Pinduoduo, has allowed criticism to spread online. China’s state news agency, Xinhua, called for shorter work hours in the country’s tech sector in an editorial on Weibo. The CCP’s flagship newspaper, the People’s Daily, also condemned the excessive 996 overtime practices as unfair to employees.

The criticisms come at a time when China’s technology champions are already under fire for other business practices. Chinese regulators have launched an antitrust probe into one of its biggest e-commerce companies and have passed new financial regulations on firms involved in online lending. Some commentators think the recent employee deaths and associated public outcry give Beijing “timely and very visceral publicity which it can leverage to further its policy objectives.” China’s state-run CCTV published a commentary calling for authorities to increase regulatory oversight of Pinduoduo and other tech companies to protect workers’ rights. The Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau has pledged to open an investigation into Pinduoduo’s labor practices over the employee deaths.

After news of the first Pinduoduo employee’s death, the company’s stock fell by 6.1 percent._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ events like PLTR demo day I'm a entry level investor and am starting to get familiar with stock events.

I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention of a possible fraudulent finance youtuber. Just in case you are getting stock picks from him, do not trust his videos blindly. 

His claim is that he was a senior financial analyst in New York, working for one of the biggest asset managers. He supposedly worked in the financial industry for close to a decade. After which, he changed jobs to work as a professional consultant with one of the Big 4s. So far, I don't have any issues with his career path. This is all well and good, however, I started to research more on his background/credentials over various social media platforms, after I watched one of his "stock advice" videos which did not make much sense. 

Suspicion 1:

1. I went to look up all his social media platforms. Initially, I wanted to see if he had a linkedin profile, so I could see where he worked at previously. However there was nothing much about his former jobs, but many certificates relating to Youtube skills.
2. I chanced across his reddit and found that he has been trying his hand at becoming a youtube content creator as far as 2 years back. He started as a *youtube content creator guru*, where he posted many videos like "how to improve your sound and voice quality" or "how to make money from a small youtube channel without ads". The videos are all deleted from youtube, but you can still see the posts that he made on reddit if you scroll down. (refer to u/TomNash_Youtube)
3. I'm guessing that did not work out so well, so he created a second and third youtube account called GearlyReviews where he reviews electronics (he is still relatively active, last post was 2 months ago) and EuroBall where he only posted 2 videos (I assumed he gave up on this account after it did not gather much views).
4. I'm guessing those scenes did not gather much traction, so he moved on to doing videos on exposing fake gurus. That gave him a degree of success, and from there, I guess he started to creep his way into the youtube finance world, and taking on a new persona as a former financial analyst.

Conclusion: From his history of reddit posts, he seemed to be an average guy trying to break into the youtube scene. It's hard to explain what I mean, so I think it's best to read his reddit account and his historic posts. Some examples are posts like "What's a good click through rate" or "do you use your face in your thumbnails" etc. The fact that over two years, he went through so much effort to become a youtuber and even tested and jumped across various youtube scenes, suggests that he was trying to become a professional content creator and earn money through youtube. 

Suspicion 2:

1. His stock picks are basically videos on stocks that were already hyped up. In his videos, his projections on the industry are often very superficial or are just completely garbage. Basically, some of the stuff he mentions are definitely not what a former financial analyst would say. For example, his video on $CHEK, he mentioned of proprietary technology that would push the stock price up if it was approved and goes through mass adoption. But the problem is, this technology already exists and while I could go into greater details, the point is, he seems to be making very lazy research and uninformed projections. To the new guys on youtube, they wouldn't know better and would blindly follow his advice.

Overall conclusion: 

I think there are many things that are fishy about him. I don't believe he was ever a professional financial analyst because he definitely does not have the knowledge I would expect of one. Apart from that, his life seems to revolve around youtube only. If he was a retired analyst, I would expect that there would still be some trace of that in his social media, whether it is a casual mention in his videos like "back in the firms, we used to do this" or some posts on finance subreddits/twitter/facebook or some photos of him in his firms etc. Another big red flag is that he used to sell courses on his facebook even though he claims to never have done so. If you guys want to verify what I'm talking about, just have a search on google and find his reddit/facebook etc. 

Why am I spending so much effort doing this? I don't like frauds and I believe they should be exposed. They are making money off people who don't know better and they should not be enjoying the success that they have by being dishonest. For those who follow Tom Nash, I recommend for all to take his advice with a grain of salt. **Remember, in a bull market, everyone is a genius.** You will not realize his advice is garbage until it's too late. Thanks all. Invest safely._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do semiconductor stocks follow Intel? First I want to say I'm a semiconductor permabull and this is 80% rant 20% question. 

Intel has shown time and time again that they won't get their heads out of the sand and admit defeat with their inferior node. Even with a new CEO, the same old mentality still persists with the company. Their atrocious guidance caused not only their stock, but the rest of the stocks in the semiconductor space to fall. I understand this is only temporary and the other semi stocks will go right back up. However, what bugs me is how this still happens even though it's obvious for over a year now that it's a problem internal to Intel and not an industry wide problem. I remember back in 2017/18 Intel's disastrous earnings always caused AMD to fall. Luckily it changed last year. 

I understand some investors see Intel as a money printing machine, but had they follow AMD for a past few years, they'd learn that most of the revenue were from deals Intel made way back when they forced AMD out of the space with monopolous policies. But that's besides the point. I'm curious what it would take for investors to stop associating Intel with successful semiconductor companies. Like IBM problems don't cause the rest of the tech industry to fall anymore does it? When will this happen in the semiconductor space? 

I have no position in Intel, but I'm long on countless other semiconductors stocks with my top five positions in AMD, NVDA, TSM, MU, and ASML. 

Sidenote: we're in the semiconductor supercycle so semiconductor stocks should vastly outperform general tech stocks this year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Serious Question/Discussion - Personal ( Any advice would be greatly appreciated) Why do I keep losing all my money?

I understand that I make bad trades but for some reason ever since I started I haven't made a single big winning trade.

I currently hold 20 shares of MT(ArcelorMittal), 10 share of PCG(Pacific Gas and Electric Company) and 60 shares of FTRCQ(Frontier Communications). I'm 15 and have been learning about investing for over 1 and a half years. I've constantly been using leverage on Trading212 in hopes of amplifying my profits but I keep losing double, triple or even quadruple more than I would've without leverage. I have to be honest, 80% of the trades I closed in the past would've been heavily in profit including tsla, xrp, jmia, cfii, tars, lazr if I had the balls to keep them till now.

I bought 4 shares @ $16. Currently, the option is $11.71. **I'm down -27%.**

The option became ITM earlier this week. My simpleton brain thought that this would mean that I at least break even.

I was thinking that it might be good to have a different way for this to end. Below are the goals that I had in mind for an amicable ending to this situation and a proposed framework to reach that goal.  This should convert GME from an easy short term bet to a good long term investment.

# Goals

* Enhance GME’s financial stability
* Provide capital for execution of strategic growth plan
* Provide an ownership structure supportive of the growth plan
* Ensure no retail investor is a bag holder
   * i.e. Some that made $1000/share and some that missed the squeeze and only made have $100/share post squeeze
* Stabilize volatility in the stock
* Distribute the short squeeze spoils to shareholders more tax efficiently than a short term capital gains windfall
* Offer the bears a (painful but acceptable) exit strategy
   * We cannot kill them or beat them within an inch of their life or they will never agree. This is kind of like a reverse bankruptcy or setting them up on a payment plan

# Mechanism

Have a shareholder vote at the 2021 Gamestop Annual Meeting (June 2021), to offer the following capital raise and exit for bears.

* Shorts pay Gamestop $420.69 for every Class A share that is shorted to create the missing shares and settle any outstanding short interest
   * Gamestop fulfills any phantom shares to investors who have been sold a phantom share by a short.
   * Gamestop retires any phantom shares that were held by a short to minimize the expansion of Class A shares
* Gamestop creates a Class C with no voting rights (similar to Alphabet or Zillow Group)
   * This will ensure supportive RC has a lot of room to maneuver on strategic execution
   * This will make it easier to do subsequent equity raises for growth
* Gamestop uses the $420.69/share to create a fund for a special dividend for Class A shareholders
   * Special dividend will be paid out $21 quarterly over 5 years
   * The first dividend will actually take the form of 1 share of Class C stock for each share of class A  

      * GME keeps this as a \~1.4-1.5 Billion cash from an equity raise which will stabilize the company’s financials
   * 19 payments of $21 to each Class A shareholder will then proceed
   * If the bears cannot afford this upfront, they can be put on a payment plan
   * Bears can contain their losses at \~30 Billion and move on
* Bears have 60 days to accept these terms or else the price for the offer goes up by $10/share/month

Background: SAP acquired Qualtrics last year for around $8 billion. Qualtrics is the top SAS player in experience management solution and is the go-to software of most of the Fortune 500 companies.

Qualtrics (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP) is planning to sell around 10% of its shares through IPO at a range of $22 and $26/share. This would value the company at $13 billion. Giving the ridiculous multiples we have seen for SAS IPO's (AirBnb, Snowflake, C3) recently, it's safe to assume that even Qualtrics might get listed over its IPO price point.

Since SAP will still hold over 80% of its stocks, will there be an increase in SAP stock price on the day of Qualtrics IPO? Technically it should since SAP's value will increase in proportion to the market value of Qualtrics.

The founder of Qualtrics is buying shares over $120 million on its IPO, which might indicate strong insider confidence._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your thoughts on Chamath Palihapitiya? Chamath talks a big talk, and he's fantastic to listen to. But how do his past investments stack up? Apart from being an early exec at facebook, what companies has he made successful or fail?

Looks like he's doing great with Virgin Galactic, but I've read that both Branson and him sell their shares to fund other ventures. I am curious if investing in his companies is a good idea at all , considering how opinionated he is on certain subjects.

I know a lot of us probably take an askance view at WSB and meme stocks, especially with all of the speculation on options and making / losing a lot of money in a very short period of time. I'm curious though, if all of this YOLO-ing has a hidden, very significant downside: Taxes you pay on profits, even if you lose your shirt a few days or weeks later.

In many cases, I realize this would likely be a wash, since assuming the gains and losses happen in the same taxable year, you'd just report net gains or losses on your 1040. But, what if you were to have a lucky windfall near the end of December, but then lose that money in January? Would you still be on the hook for the on-paper gains you had in the previous tax year?

Let's say you made $100,000 on a good option trade on December 31, but then lost $95,000 of that on January 2. Would you still be on the hook for paying income and state tax on that $100,000, (likely around $15K to $25K) even though you now only have $5K left, as that strikes me as being \*extremely\* stressful? I realize you could offset that loss in future tax years, but for the year you're filing, does the IRS expect you to come up with that tax money?

I realize this is all in addition to the actual stress of losing the money in the first place - which is why I'm happy with my very sensible, regular investments into my boring old Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can you tell if you committed a free ride violation Hello,

I had the amount needed to cover in a checking account tied to my investing account, and shares that were already settled as well. Now I can still buy and trade stocks and put alot more money in my account to try and settle the issue but on GME, even though I just bought 5 shares to see what would happen, it displays "Days Value Change -67.84% @ -$650.93.

Company XYZ is now trading on expiration day at $60, with current call option premium at $12

I understand I have 2 options to exit:

Option 1: EXERCISE

With this, I would buy the 1000 shares at the $40 strike price, therefore owning 1000 shares at a cost basis of 45.78 (40+5.78) per share (45780 total cost). I could then turn around and sell the shares immediately at the current trading price for 14.22 (60-45.78) per share profit (14220 total cost).

Link: https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/

From the summary:

> The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble. Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000

> These great bubbles are where fortunes are made and lost – and where investors truly prove their mettle. For positioning a portfolio to avoid the worst pain of a major bubble breaking is likely the most difficult part. Every career incentive in the industry and every fault of individual human psychology will work toward sucking investors in.

> But this bubble will burst in due time, no matter how hard the Fed tries to support it, with consequent damaging effects on the economy and on portfolios. Make no mistake – for the majority of investors today, this could very well be the most important event of your investing lives.

I keep reading that it would be wise to get out of the bond market all together since interest rates are very low and bond yields will follow. When do we expect this to happen? I am looking at my bond funds and it appears they performed well in 2020 overall. Most of the funds I own hold bonds with 5-8 and 8+ year maturities, but it looks like the short term bond funds are also trending favourably.

Also, did the reason to own bonds and the risk profile of bonds change with the events of March/April? Part of the reason to own bonds is that they don't correlate with equities and yet in March bonds fell alongside equities in a panic to safety. I know this is not a normal occurrence but we have to assume that this type of action will happen again and since it didn't happen previously the path forward is somewhat in question._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do people say things like TQQQ are better for short term investing and QQQ are better for long term?

BYD Co. , a Chinese car maker backed by Warren Buffett, raised $3.9 billion from a stock sale, joining peers in capitalizing on investors’ bullishness about new-energy vehicles.

The deal marks BYD’s biggest equity financing since it listed in Hong Kong in 2002. The company, whose stock also trades in Shenzhen, makes electric cars, batteries, plug-in hybrids and fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.

Investor enthusiasm about green cars and breakthroughs in battery technology have sent the company’s stock soaring, making it more attractive for BYD to raise new funds. BYD stock in Hong Kong has more than quintupled in a year, giving it a market capitalization of $91 billion. That is roughly in line with NIO Inc., a newer Chinese rival, and compares to an $806 billion market cap for Tesla Inc., according to FactSet.

Other electric-car makers have also tapped equity markets for funds as they race to secure a bigger slice of the growing sector. Chinese competitor Xpeng Inc. in December raised $2.5 billion from a follow-on offering of American depositary receipts, while NIO has raised more than $4.5 billion in December and January by selling ADRs and convertible bonds.

A unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has held a stake in BYD since 2008.

According to this blog post: [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/) AWS is creating a fork of Elasticsearch.

Elastic was originally fully open source but changed the terms of their licensing to stop companies like Amazon from freely using their code to provide the same paid service that Elastic provides.

In 2019, AWS created a fully open source version of elasticsearch but it wasn't a fork (meaning that code contributions went to both the AWS version and the Elastic version of the source code) When that happened, the stock dropped 20%.

Because of the paucity of investment options in the Canadian marketplace, a lot of Canadians buy stuff like ARKK or VGT or what have you (obvously in USD) and then deal with the foreign withholding taxes on the dividends that they produce.

I was wondering how that works in reverse though. For instance, let's say as an American resident you wanted targeted exposure to the Canadian markets, so you bought [XIC.TO](https://XIC.TO), or you wanted to buy a Canadian company directly like Nortel (hehe).

**It's interesting to note that $NUMI (Numinus Wellness Inc) has 3x the share allocation vs. $MMED (MINDMED INC) within the index.**

**My Take:**

The weightings of the Solactive index is interesting. Within the index, $NUMI (Numinus Wellness Inc) has 3x the share allocation vs. $MMED (MINDMED INC). $NUMI being the Canadian leader in the psychedelic space. $MMED being the lead player in the market with a $1.50B Market Cap vs. $NUMI at $250M. At 6x the market cap, I expect significant upside potential for $NUMI with the launch of the ETF. 

Overall I am very bullish on this ETF. The index is up 12.70% since Monday.

First of all, this is all **SPECULATION**, so feel free to downvote.

You will probably write it off as **"FUD"** or **conspiracy** or trolling. You will also probably label me as a "tinfoil OCD paranoid", which isn't far from the truth... OR you might cheer on and say it's all true and Tether is a huge scam and Bitcoin will fall to 0.

I'm not trying to be black or white and take one side, but to see the nuances, which there are plenty.

Since I have stake in Bitcoin it is my interest to see what are possible weak points. So naturally, Tether drama attracts my attention and I try to figure out is it legit or not.

Today, on 22th of January, Unchained Podcast did an interview with Gregory Pepin, deputy CEO of Deltec Bank and Trust (Tether's bank).

You can watch the interview here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ3nQ8-KY28

Everyone can analyze what he said and people will do that and speculate about it. So I analyzed **HOW** he said it, to give another perspective.

**Some things I mentioned in the way Gregory Pepin responded to questions:**


Overall he is doing over-complicated over-explaining which is what usually a guilty suspect does. This leads to believe that if Tether WAS fully backed he would be more convinced in his answers: "Yes, we checked and verified that Tether is 100% backed by USD".

He is also using "whataboutisms", when host Laura Shin says USDT is deregulated, then he instantly jumps to "What about USDC". He also seems to have a rather nervous body language and focuses a lot on misdirection to leer away from any uncomfortable questions.

**4:58**, pay attention to how he is answering. When he claims Tether is backed his eyes are darting all over, he can't keep his gaze fixed. His hands are folded and he is assuming a defensive position, his whole tone is condescending, this indicates that he feels threatened. If he had nothing to hide, he would not have this body language.

**19:00** "We KIND OF verified and we continued to verify that they are PRETTY MUCH following that what everybody is expecting them to follow": pay attention to wording. He is being vague and assuming defensive body language. He isn't definite in the answer.

**23:00** When asked if he is worried about NY Attorney General investigators office, he doesn't answer directly, exhibits very nervous body language: eyes darting, shifting in seat, stress laugh at end (people laugh to comfort themselves). IMO, he is scared.

**24:24** When asked about Deltec Bank's Bitcoin holdings: lip biting, nervous smile, shifting in seat, more nervous body language. Then answers without maintaining fixed gaze (eyes darting) indicating he might not be truthful. Then when he starts talking about other investment firms holding Bitcoin as a normal asset in portfolio, his eyes are fixed and his tone is more relaxed, showing that he is confident in what he is saying (more truth). "They have our own truth and we have ours **I GUESS**". These vague terms are used as a copout insurance. Like saying: "I think you should do X, **but IDK**", so you don't take responsibility for what you said if something goes wrong.

**26:06** now here I think he is ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH. He seems way more confident about statements made of Bitfinex NOT buying BTC from Deltec. Notice how he is keeping gaze more fixed and is very confident in his statements. Also says that Bitfinex is not shareholder of Deltec. I believe he is saying the truth here from how confidently he presents it. It is a nice comparison to his nervous behavior in other parts of interview.

**26:44** asked if Deltec was purchasing BTC for clients he isn't confident in his answer. Again, rocking in chair, darting gaze, vague wording, not a confident "Yes, that's right!". He says: "Exactly, in the portfolio management that the client..." and then distracts to irrelevant information. Then proceeds to touch chin as stress reducer (people do this often when they feel they are lying).

Do these things prove he is lying? **No.**

Do I personally think he is lying? **Yes.**

Do I think Tether is fully backed? **No.**

Will I take any actions regarding my BTC position? **No**, because even if Tether is an unbacked scam, it might go on for years until it gets busted and Bitcoin historically has recovered from everything, even MtGox bust.

Can I be wrong about all of this? **Definitely.**

Am I a complete idiot paranoid armchair psychologist? **It's a possibility**

However, do you think this is irrelevant when it comes to whole Tether drama?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinion from those invested in renewables/lithium/Tesla Would like to get the opinions of reddiots that have invested in solar/wind/Tesla/lithium.

No problem.

————————-
I’ve never seen anything like this. Earnings were expected today 1/21 at 4 pm EST. Stock shot up several dollars about 15 minutes BEFORE the earnings release because they were leaked and actually posted on the company’s website. The company admitted this during the reporting and said someone took a presentation slide, so they decided to post the whole thing. 

The market however was open when this happened and I’m guessing it cost a lot of folks billions because others bought due to seeing information that was not supposed to be public. 

Is this not something SEC should investigate? What if there was insider trading and they “leaked” a slide to cover it up?

I've seen a lot of people asking what the best 5G stocks are, and mostly it's related to the implementation of 5G itself.

For example, will we see further growth in Roku or Trade Desk because of an increased reliance on streaming now that it would be even more efficient than cable?

Should we be investing in self driving cars because of the groundwork 5G would lay for that technology?

I still believe there is huge room for growth._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Big 5 Sporting Goods (NASDAQ: BGFV) For anyone looking for a new idea to add to their portfolio -

Big 5 Sporting Goods (**BGFV)** is a sporting goods retailer in the western U.S. with 431 stores as of the end of 3Q2020 (\~50% in California but has presence in Washington, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah as well). BGFV’s average store size is 11K square feet, so think of these as smaller scale versions of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores (35-45K square feet per store) but larger than a Hibbett Sports store (5.6K square feet average size). Despite BGFV’s relatively small market cap (\~$260M), this is a very real business with very real earnings that is - I believe - significantly undervalued.

1. BGFV has been a huge beneficiary of the stay-at-home lifestyle following the initial lockdown measures. Same-store sales declined 11% in 1Q2020 and 4% in 2Q2020 (partial lockdown period) but jumped to a +15% increase in 3Q2020 as people staying at home purchased “hardgoods” (pretty much anything that’s not apparel or footwear), which represent \~50% of BGFV’s sales. Breaking down the 15% increase in sales in 3Q2020 – hardgood sales grew by 38% while footwear sales declined 19% and apparel sales decline 8%. BGFV posted preliminary 4Q2020 earnings last week which showed same store sales growth of +11% for the quarter. Management typically talks about how the next quarter is trending during the earnings call, so we should be able to learn more about January / February in the Q4 call as well.

Obviously the COVID benefit won’t last forever, but there still seems to be a \~4-6+ month tail until there’s widespread vaccinations in the US. Even still, a portion of former gymgoers might prefer to work out from home instead, avoiding crowds and touching equipment that’s been used by others and not always sanitized between each use. (As a side note, BGFV is a seller of guns and ammo, which means they like benefitted there as well with the last few months of unrest in the US...)

2. BGFV’s balance sheet is in the best position its ever been dating to at least 2002 (per financial statements). 3Q2020 marks the first time that BGFV operated without debt (though, to be fair, the last several years have only utilized a revolver with very cheap interest rates primarily to fund working capital). Said differently, liquidity (measured as cash + net working capital – debt) of $170M is the best it’s ever been since at least 2002. This compares to $126M at the end of 2019 and $97M at the end of 2018. Cash on the balance sheet at the end of 3Q2020 was $56M (press release from last week mentioned in increase to $65M as of the end of December) compared to the $5-8M cash BGFV typically operates with - more on this below.

3. VALUATION. This is the main reason to buy for me. As of close today, BGFV’s market capitalization sits at $262M. Netting out the ton of cash sitting on the balance sheet, enterprise value is only $197M. This compares to sales for the 12 months ending December 2020 of $1,041M, implying a 0.19x enterprise value / sales multiple. This is *very* low. The same multiple is 0.42x for Dick’s and 0.55x for Hibbett. I'm personally not a fan of sales multiples, however BGFV’s enterprise value / EBITDA multiple is also extremely low at 2.9x (will go down - BGFV didn’t post an income statement for FY2020 yet, but the strong Q4 revenue growth noted in the press release last week highlights that EBITDA will definitely be higher than the $7M for Q4 of last year) – also *very* low and effectively implies that BGFV is near bankruptcy (which it clearly isn’t, with no debt and $55M+ of excess cash on the balance sheet). EV / EBITDA multiples for Dick’s is 4.4x and for Hibbett is 7.0x. All three of the businesses had the same hits to earnings in Q1 + Q2 and same benefits in Q3 + Q4. Given the negative earnings impact from COVID in Q1 + Q2, the next two quarters should be fairly easy comp periods, meaning these bottom barrel multiples will compress even further on nearly guaranteed earnings growth.

4. At this point, it’s unclear what management plans on doing with the excess cash. I’m expecting a mix of (1) keeping an above average cash balance to the extent COVID continues on and (2) investments in improving the website / e-commerce platform (looks like it hasn’t had a major revamp since the early 2010s, though the home page is clearly pushing home fitness and winter / outdoor gear). Historically, management has had a focus on returning capital to shareholders through primarily dividends (had some buybacks in the past). Ideally management will be willing to repurchase a block of shares in the market or issue a special dividend, but can’t guarantee any of that. I’m hoping this is addressed during the Q4 earnings call.

My price target here is $30-45, with 1Q2021 and 2Q2021 results determining where I’d actually sell (as well as management’s plan for the shit ton of cash they have). Will try to answer any questions that come up, and appreciate any feedback on the idea!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Most overvalued companies and why? Hello investors of reddit.

I know in today’s market we are seeing companies breaking their all time price records day in and day out, companies being traded at p/e and p/b ratios that would give Benjamin graham and warren Buffett heart attacks. But I will still ask our community.

Which companies do you think are the most overvalued and why? Please take into consideration future growth as well as financial metrics._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is it nearly impossible to make a profit swing trading Forex? Let me preface everything with this: I understand that active trading is not a reliable investment vehicle and making a living off of it is nearly impossible. I have a comfortable full time job that I enjoy and am financially stable with consistent investments in more traditional places.

I've done some studying up (and will continue to do so). So here's my confusion as to why making a profit is so difficult: If I take only reasonable positions and set reasonable stop-losses with a favorable risk-reward ratio, then I'd only need to be right like 1/3 of the time to at least break even, no? But even if the markets are 100% random and you can only randomly pick your positions, wouldn't you expect to be right about half the time in the long run? And if I adopt a strategy that makes it so I'm only right, say, 10% of the time, can't I just invert my strategy? It seems to me that, if you're able to identify a pattern in the market in such a way that you are consistently right or wrong more than 50% of the time, then you have what you need to make a profit. And even if you are only right 50% of the time, you'd still make a profit because of the risk-reward math. So as long as you don't get wiped out so quickly that you are unable to stabilize over the long term, you should almost always profit. But that can't be right. Can someone explain what is wrong with this line of thinking?

With that said, I have a couple thousand dollars that I had originally saved for some personal expenses that will no longer be necessary. While I could just stick them back into savings or an index fund for reliable returns, it is money that I was originally perfectly ok with spending so it's also money that I'm not terribly scared to lose though obviously I'd prefer not to. I'm not looking to get rich quick, or make a living or anything like that. The market is just interesting to me and, based on my previous (possibly flawed) line of thinking, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard to make like $50 a month. So that's really my big question. The sentiment in this sub on active trading is pretty much "don't do it you'll lose everything". But if you get educated and make conservative, mathematically favorable trades, is it really that impossible to just pick a couple small winning positions a month and make some beer money?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the term for free cash that may be used to place new orders? In my account with Interactive Brokers ("IBKR"), I have several open/active BUY orders with a certain amount of funds committed to each order. So, what piece of my account information tells me the amount that is _free_ or the amount I can use to place new orders?

I tried to place an order that totalled less than the "Cash Available", which was rejected. I therefore gather that part of this "Cash Available" amount is committed to the open BUY orders. So, how can I find out the amount that is _free_ and uncommitted?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help me understand short squeeze This may be a dumb question so forgive me, but why would a short seller liquidate their position by buying shares instead of just hedging by buying a call?

It seems like the most effective way of covering/hedging a position without impacting the market in an undesirable direction.

If every short seller were to cover/hedge their positions by buying a call, would a short squeeze still occur? The option prices would go up but the underlying stock wouldn’t move unless some option seller covered their position with stock. 

What am I missing? Thanks in advance

I have a number of stocks that I consider long term holds in my portfolio and really never considered a strategy for using stop losses to protect gains since I plan to hold long term. With the drop we saw with covid earlier this year I started thinking about this to preserve capital on a significant market swing.

For example, if you look at Apple, today it is trading again at or near all-time highs. It is of course a great stock and amazing investment. But if you look at the dip that we road from the 80's to the 50's as the country close many of us just road it out.

If you would recommend a strategy, for example using a trailing stop loss, what would it look like in this example against current highs and why?

The 10-year bond at that time? Roughly 5%. Today the S&P earnings yield is ~2.6%. The 10-year bond? 1.1%. We are nowhere near as overvalued as we were in 1999. While not being as overvalued as we were in 1999 is really not a hard bar to pass, I do think it is worth mentioning as the "gravity" of both situations are entirely different. 

So are we in a bubble as a whole market? Not really. Sure, we are overpriced by roughly 15-20%, (based on how I assess it) but if your outlook is beyond 10 years, it is very smart to continue to buy. And if the market dips? Buy your favorite companies at better prices.

I'll close on this: if one could correctly time the market, they'd be a trillionaire.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in nearly three weeks, as the popular cryptocurrency was hit with a double whammy that jolted faith in its user base.

First, Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden's nominee for treasury secretary, suggested during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday that lawmakers "curtail" the use of Bitcoin because of its use in illicit activities.

And second, a debunked report from BitMEX Research on Wednesday suggested that a critical flaw called "double spend" had occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain.
