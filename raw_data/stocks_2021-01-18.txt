I have a hard time believing it won’t recover but I also don’t know what I’m doing really. I know lots of people think that theatres are a thing of the past, and that Netflix and all other streaming services are taking over. I personally really enjoy going to the movies and having that experience from time to time. I know a lot of other people do too, so I have a hard time believing they will ever be truly eliminated. Not to mention the fact that box office is still a significant indicator of a movies success, and theatres can still provide unique qualities like 3D that not everyone has access to at home. Clearly I am still confident in the theatre industry as a whole.

A ton of high budget anticipated movies are scheduled to come out in 2021. Many of which were set to release in 2020 but got delayed. I understand that they could be delayed again depending on the pandemic and vaccine situation, but let’s assume that they release as scheduled. Should that not mean AMC will recover significantly, especially if theatres can reach full capacity again?

While other theatre stocks have recovered partially already, AMC has continued to drop. I don’t know if this is because something is fundamentally wrong with their business that has nothing to do with the pandemic, but that would make sense. I know there is serious talks of them going bankrupt. I honestly don’t understand how that would effect the stock because I am still a new investor. I’m sure it could be significant though. I still don’t see AMC disappearing forever though, and if it could recover to even close to what it was in September that would make it a good investment. Especially if the price continues to dip. So please can someone explain to me if I’m wrong, why?

**MY FAVORITE: ATNX, BTG, FSLR, KPTI, VRSN, WDAY, YEXT**

&#x200B;

AKTS - Very similar set up to AEYE. Just retesting the 50EMA line, support, and channel up line. Indicators are fair, but Stoch is low. Good setup, not great.

[https://tos.mx/q6XhiSu](https://tos.mx/q6XhiSu)

&#x200B;

ATNX - Fantastic channel play. Headed up from ground 0, which I love. Indicators are fair, but that makes sense with it running up. This is the first pullback of a run up.

[https://tos.mx/OiaYI6w](https://tos.mx/OiaYI6w)

&#x200B;

AXU  - Great channel play, but we are not at not at perfect value. I want to see it get a tad bit lower before we really buy in. But indicators look good for a reversal eventually.

[https://tos.mx/167d4xB](https://tos.mx/167d4xB)

&#x200B;

BTG - Fantastic setup here. Stock is about to start consolidating, and then take off eventually. Indicators look great, it just needs to show life.

[https://tos.mx/UXO4TzJ](https://tos.mx/UXO4TzJ)

&#x200B;

C - Like AEYE and AKTS, a little overbought. Retesting 50EMA and channel support. Indicators are low, but is this consistent; no. So lets see if it can do it one more time.

[https://tos.mx/WYgvQhE](https://tos.mx/WYgvQhE)

&#x200B;

CP   - Great run up, but earnings are coming. 50EMA bounce, over support. Great setup, but this is not sustainable; and earnings are coming soon. RSI is only fair.

[https://tos.mx/uEg8Z92](https://tos.mx/uEg8Z92)

&#x200B;

EDU  - Fantastic run up and channel up play. It would be perfect, if it were down to $166. It is still at a good value, but it isn't perfect yet. Indicators are just fair.

[https://tos.mx/mggIMnW](https://tos.mx/mggIMnW)

&#x200B;

FIVN - Good channel up again. 50EMA bounce, again the support is far away so it is more risk. It is a good setup, but not sustainable. Will we get one more push, hopefully. 

[https://tos.mx/W5u0Tjt](https://tos.mx/W5u0Tjt)

&#x200B;

FSLR - Fantastic channel up, everything is there. Channel Support, Support, 200EMA line, and Indicators are perfect. This is a 10/10 play if it shows life Tuesday.

[https://tos.mx/SfBZSJs](https://tos.mx/SfBZSJs)

[https://tos.mx/hM0oRc3](https://tos.mx/hM0oRc3)

&#x200B;

MSON - Good channel but not at best value, but a good setup. I want it to be close to $11. But it did gap down, so that gap will want to be filled eventually.

[https://tos.mx/VU5I2mS](https://tos.mx/VU5I2mS)

MTNB - Great ascending triangle but overbought. The stop lose makes it a lot of risk, and it is already overbought. Good setup, but it is still a bit risky.

[https://tos.mx/osnVCmI](https://tos.mx/osnVCmI)

&#x200B;

SDC  - Great channel up again, but I want it closer to $10.50 right now. It is looking strong and has room to run, but it just needs a tad more value. All indicators show a reversal.

[https://tos.mx/YDVwTtZ](https://tos.mx/YDVwTtZ)

&#x200B;

TTMI - Channel up off the 50EMA line, but it is now sustainable. Let's see if it keeps showing some life from here. Indicators say it should reverse but it is so overbought.

[https://tos.mx/U4KDccM](https://tos.mx/U4KDccM)

VEEV - Great channel, but once again not at my perfect area of value. I want $257. Indicators look pretty great, and a reversal is coming, may be here but I wish it was lower.

[https://tos.mx/62B3O6k](https://tos.mx/62B3O6k)

&#x200B;

VMW  - Great area of value, but is it going to reverse here or drop more? Over reaction from a new CEO, so I think it has great life but not the best price or reward.

[https://tos.mx/hN02c3D](https://tos.mx/hN02c3D)

I recently started to look into investing as a way to grow my wealth and get some passive income going. I was on the Business Insider website and noticed they had a section called Commodities. In this section they have lists containing things such as cotton, soybeans, corn, silver, and even cocoa 😍

I was immediately interested in investing in cocoa since I love chocolate and so do many other people but I have not been able to find a way to do this. I have read that the prices of cocoa can be very volatile and if you look at the 1 or 3 year charts on Business Insider: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/cocoa-price](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/cocoa-price) you can see this for yourself.

With all the things I have been reading about stocks I have learned that one of the best and least time consuming things you can do is to invest in some good companies and then just check back every so often while keeping with news related to them. This way you don't have to think about your investments everyday.

However that would not provide me with passive income in the way I am thinking unless they were to pay substantial amounts of dividends.

So this is where cocoa comes in. It is volatile and I believe that with enough research about demand and season patterns I would be able to trade cocoa on a weekly basis and consistently cash out some money at the end of every week or month. It appears to swing about 20% regularly and this makes for a good trade.

Now I have to admit I am somewhat influenced by a guy who tried investing in gourd but he failed since he bought high and realized he would have to sell low. I think he did not know what he was doing and this is why he failed. I however honestly believe I can research the cocoa industry and production environments enough to be able to successfully and profitably trade cocoa.

But again, I do not know where to begin and what an initial investment would look like. If anyone has any insight into trading commodities I would be really grateful since I have only been learning about stocks for the past week or so.

Thank you in advance!

\----

Edit: I have looked into cocoa investing some more and I have found a couple way to do this. ETFs and futures. There is also a way to directly trade cocoa with leverage in the Canadian market however this would require setting up an account with another broker, and of course using leverage which I am not interested in.

The ETF I found is **iPath Bloomberg Cocoa Subindex Total Return(SM) ETN (NIB).** This seems to track the Jones-UBS Cocoa Subindex Total ReturnService Mark and its returns match returns from unleveraged futures contracts on cocoa.

As for the futures contracts themselves, I think you can find these by searching for **CC=F** on Yahoo Finance: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CC=F?p=CC=F&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CC=F?p=CC=F&.tsrc=fin-srch).

So with the new information I have found, it seems the simplest way would be to trade the ETF. I am still looking on how to trade the cocoa futures directly so if you can help me with that, I would be very grateful!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Living off dividends outside The US Hey all.

I am completely new to the world of investing and stock trading and had the spontaneous notion to document my initial experiences with it so that perhaps more matured enthusiasts / professionals could share their thoughts or at the very least excel air from their nose in a mild for of laughter at my innocent inexperience.   


I am interested to see if my experiences are relatable. Not sure if this is much fun for anybody else to read but at the very least it will be a good process for me to reflect on my past month and access what my next steps should be.  


In this journal I am going to note **what Ive learned** so far, **what investments/ trades I have made**, and **what I want to learn next**.  


# What I learned this month

* **How to actually make a trade** \- I set myself up on the Revolut app as it was recommended to me by a friend. I'm sure there are better systems out there but for a beginner I think it suits me just fine. 
* **That the markets are only open Monday to Friday for a fixed number of hours!** \- this one seems obvious but I was very surprised to discover this.
* **The different types of trader / trading styles** \- scalpers, patterned day traders, swing traders, long-term investors.
* **Patterned day traders must have $25,000+ in their account.**
* **Candlesticks** \- what they are and how they work.. a very basic understanding. Not too familiar with spotting patterns yet.
* The importance of **keeping emotion out of the equation** when making a decision on a trade. Especially short-term trades.
* **Investing in what you believe in** \- when making long term investments yes it is important to do some research into the company you plan to invest in however if it is something you plan to hold for 10-20 years your best bet is to go with what you believe is a good solid company that will succeed in the future.  


# What still confuses me

* **Call Options** \- For the life of me, even with research I cant wrap my head around what call options are and how they work. Like, what is actually happening there...

# 

# What Investments/ Trades I have made so far

Ok so I may have told a minor lie - I actually made my first investments 6 months ago when my friend told me about the Revolut app and his great successes with bitcoin trading. However it wasn't until this month that I decided to buckle down and get stuck into it properly.   


My initial investments were for just 1 share each in Fiverr and DocuSign. I chose these without any research and simply asked myself which companies do I have a good feeling about in the next 5 years. Since my investment, Fiver is up 134% and DocuSign is up 26%. This is partly what caused me to gives this more attention and urged me to delve deeper.  


This month I bought 20 shares in **$NIO** and 2 shares in **$TSLA**. I then stumbled across r/wallstreetbets and like most rookie idiots I jumped on the FOMO bandwagon. Although I do believe I haven't blindly invested anywhere and everywhere. I still did my research and chose wisely. Which resulted in my purchase of 6 **$PLTR** shares, 8 **$GME** shares, and 23 **$BB** shares. regardless of the hype these all seem like they should do well this year at least.  


# What I want to learn more about next

* WTF is a call option??
* Which style of trading suits me best - I want to experiment a little and test out different approaches
* I want to learn more about day trading e.g. risk management, patterns, strategies etc.

I'm looking for resources that discuss portfolio diversification, specifically, are there proven diversification strategies or principles, and at what "scale" diversification should be applied. For example, any business can be classified within a nested hierarchy of sectors; a silver mining company is silver/precious metals/all metals/commodities. At what scale here would one want to be diversified, given you think a variety of metals has growth potential? Is "silver" too focused and "all metals" too broad? If precious metals is a reasonable scale, how many stocks are too many to have in your portfolio, given one could have junior explorers, mid level developers, and major producers, some with dividends some without, distributed across the globe?

I think by now everyone recognizes the EV market in China is more lucrative than any other country given the TAM size and CCP’s aggressive push on transition to EV. Obviously, the EV space in China is getting crowded and not everyone will emerge as a winner. From my perspective, I think a lot of investors are missing the key competitive advantage in the future EV race when evaluating an EV player. The most important differentiation from one EV to another isn’t its design, hardware (performance, range, safety, etc.) or even price, it’s software and in other words, tech and autonomous driving development. Whoever comes out ahead in autonomous driving will emerge as leaders in the EV space. Personally, I think Xpeng will come out on top based on its huge focus on software development and promising execution thus far:
 
Xpeng markets its EVs as “smart” EVs from the get go and mainly focuses on the tech components and, most importantly, autonomous driving development. Among all Chinese EV competitors, Xpeng was the first to decide to utilize Nvidia’s platform to advance autonomous driving. Others like Li and Nio followed suit later on. Xpeng has also been constantly upgrading its autonomous driving software and its latest NGP (version 3.0) has been starting to receive more recognitions in China. 

Xpeng is heavily backed by institutional investors and CCP. 5 state-owned banks just handed Xpeng a $2 billion line of credit without Xpeng having to potentially give up equity. CCP will not let Xpeng fail. 

Within a short period of time, Xpeng will be already rolling out 3 mass market EVs including a new sedan by Q3 to Q4 this year. We all know the mass market is ultimately where most of the money comes from (Tesla did not take off until Model 3 release). Xpeng’s rapid rollout of mass market EVs is very impressive but could also result in capacity risk. However, Xpeng is already in the process of manufacturing its second plant in Guangzhou which will be operational by Q3 this year, bringing the total annual capacity to min. 200k+. Xpeng is also planning to expand manufacturing by most likely building a third plant in the near future via the new LOC from state owned banks. As a result,  Xpeng will be able to scale quickly, much quicker than Nio, and handle the demand spike without delay issues.  

Xpeng has demonstrated to have great execution thus far. It achieved 10k deliveries milestones and positive GPM faster than any other Chinese EV competitor. Both Nio and Xpeng are backed by CCP but, unlike Nio, Xpeng never had liquidity issue and did not utilize government funding for bailout. 

If one worries about Xpeng’s potential legal problems due to allegations by Tesla against Xpeng’s employee. You shouldn’t. The investigation went on for 2 years with zero legal credibility. It has been a war of words going nowhere. See link below for the timeline of the allegations.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/455900/xpeng-responds-elon-musk-tweet/amp/

In conclusion, I’m bullish on Xpeng and overall Chinese EV market. I think Xpeng ($34.1mil market cap) is a cheap buy compared to Nio ($87.7mil market cap) right now and later on people might regret putting all the eggs in Nio’s basket._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is actually happening behind a candlestick pattern?

At the same time, I’m not sure if Apple (a $1tn+ company) will try to go after this industry. I believe Jamf has a good set of competitive advantages that will ward off competition and Apple.

What is mobile device management and enterprise mobility management? These terms are about securing the information and data on employees’ corporate or personal devices. If I’m using a corporate device, my employer is most likely using some software to make sure no information gets hacked into or stolen.

In the simplest terms, Jamf helps to protect its customers’ information and manage devices remotely. Jamf focuses on Apple devices. That’s their specialty. Other companies offer similar services but focus on providing that one service across Windows and Apple devices whereas Jamf focuses on providing many services to only Apple devices.

**Business Overview**

Founded in 2002 by Zach Halmstad, Christopher Thon, and Chip Pearson, Jamf provides mobile device management software to its customers. The current CEO, Dean Hager, took over in 2015 and replaced Halmstad and Pearson. Vista Equity Partners acquired a majority of Jamf’s shares in December 2017 and still holds a majority stake today.

Jamf helps its customers manage Apple devices, products, or other Apple-related software/hardware. Employers that manage these resources want employees to have a secure Apple device that can be tracked and managed remotely.

At the end of Q3 (September 2020), Jamf had more than 43,000 customers with more than 18.6 million Apple devices. Jamf relies on a typical SaaS model to collect revenue. Jamf has customers ranging from Apple itself to 7 of the top 10 Fortune 500 technology companies, 24 of the 25 most valuable brands, and the 10 largest U.S. banks.

**Products**

Many of Jamf’s products match the same services as other public tech companies. For example, Crowdstrike provides Endpoint Protection, but Jamf Protect provides these same services but specific to Apple devices. Jamf continues to add new product offerings and expand into different industries.

Jamf has 5 main products, [Jamf Connect](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-connect/), [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-pro/), [Jamf Now](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/), [Jamf School](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-school/), and [Jamf Protect](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-protect/). The image in the article (can't fit the article into this post) provides a good comparison between Jamf’s offerings for the Apple vertical and the horizontal providers. I won’t be going into detail on these specific horizontal use cases. Jamf’s bread and butter is Jamf Pro, which accounted for 78% of total revenue in 2019.

Why would customers choose Jamf over Crowdstrike, Okta, or other horizontal providers? Jamf provides solutions specific to Apple devices rather than trying to solve problems for both Apple and Windows devices. For example, Apple devices have different security risks and weaknesses than Windows laptops so a horizontal solution such as Crowdstrike may not be the best solution for a company looking to manage a fleet of Apple devices. These solutions are managed remotely.

**Total Addressable Market**

Management states the global total addressable market for Apple Enterprise Management is $10.3 billion. Different independent research firms believe that this industry will also grow to $23.4 billion by 2024.

Although I like to gauge the TAM from different sources, anyone can google this information and find it out. There is no “edge” in investing like this. The way I’d think about this is what percentage of enterprise customers and their employees will have Apple devices that may need to be managed through Jamf. For example, will employees have an iPhone dedicated only to work? What about a laptop or a desktop computer? Throw in an iPad? Now, what’s the realistic average number of Apple devices for employees multiplied by the average cost per device to get an estimate of the TAM. Where else can Jamf expand? Into schools? Check. But what’s next. I’m not sure but I bet there’s some room for growth out there.

Secondly, although the number of Apple devices in businesses may be small today, what will this look like in the future? Will more companies be giving their employees an option between Apple and Windows? Jamf’s management team believes so. Are more people fans of Apple or Windows devices?

So although you may initially say that Windows will always be the main OS, a Jamf chart says otherwise ([Link - Q3 Investor Presentation](https://ir.jamf.com/static-files/5f5bbdf0-e77c-4172-bef6-bc289162e9f5) on page 6). If you’re in finance, you may never use an Apple device simply due to your reliance on Excel and other finance shortcuts, but other industries may not have this reliance on Windows computers.

**Competitive Advantages**

I believe Jamf has a number of competitive advantages.

* **Jamf Nation**
   * [Jamf Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/) is the largest online community of Apple IT administrators in the world. There are more than 100,000+ members. If a customer has a question, they can visit Jamf Nation and search to find an answer or ask the question themselves. This is basically a subreddit specific to Apple IT administrators looking for answers.
   * The scale of this community gives Jamf a competitive advantage because when competitors’ customers have questions, they won’t have such a large community of people that can help them answer questions.
* **Jamf Marketplace**
   * [Jamf Marketplace](https://www.jamf.com/community/marketplace/) allows customers to integrate with other tools and extend the reach of Jamf’s platform. As Jamf grows in size and develops relationships with more companies and grows the list of integrations, smaller companies will be unable to match the number of integrations that Jamf Marketplace offers.
* **Economies of Scale**
   * Jamf was founded in 2002 and since then has focused on providing a suite of solutions specific to Apple devices. No other company has come close, including Apple. As the leading company providing solutions for companies with Apple devices, Jamf has developed products built on its focus on Apple. This expertise of Apple spans the suite of products and gives Jamf a competitive advantage through economies of scale. Competitors are unable to replicate Jamf’s offerings in a timely manner. Jamf sells software. Software is a “build once, sell twice” type of product, meaning it gives Jamf incremental margin for each customer and Apple device it captures.
   * As Jamf grows in size, it will build products faster than smaller companies. Jamf will bundle different products into one offering to competitors at a lower price which will keep competition away. For example, wrapping together Jamf Connect, Jamf Pro, and Jamf Now for a hypothetical $20 per Apple device meanwhile a smaller company can only offer the equivalent of Jamf Pro for $15 per Apple device. This obviously makes Jamf’s proposition more appealing. Although costs aren’t everything, Jamf does benefit from its size giving it a possible advantage in the quality column.

**Financials**

Another tech company with strong growth. Let’s check out the numbers.

**2019:**

* Total revenue = $204 million
* Subscription revenue = $159 million
* Subscription revenue growth = 59%
* Subscription gross profit margin = 80%
* GAAP EBIT margin = -10%
* Annual recurring revenue = $209 million
* Dollar-based net retention rate = 118%

**2018:**

* Total revenue = $147 million
* Subscription revenue = $100 million
* Subscription gross profit margin = 76%
* GAAP EBIT margin = -20%
* Annual recurring revenue = $142 million
* Dollar-based net retention rate = 117%

Jamf doesn’t give financial numbers before December 2018. The most attractive part of Jamf is the subscription revenue that grew more than 59% from 2018 to 2019. This comes with high gross margins and depending on your outlook is likely to continue growing for some time.

Jamf has yet to release its 2020 annual earnings, but it expects total revenue of $263 million for the year ended December 2020.

**What’s Interesting**

* **Undervalued relative to other high growth tech companies?**
   * Jamf has a market cap of \~$3.9 billion at the time of writing this. Considering Jamf expects total revenue of $263 million and assuming it grows \~30% to $340 million. $3.9 billion / $340 million = 11.5x P/S multiple. Although valuation isn’t this easy (I wish it was) this seems rather cheap relative to other tech companies.
   * This shouldn’t be a basis for your investment though, but what makes Jamf relatively undervalued to its peers?
* **Riding Apple’s tailcoats.**
   * Apple is one of if not the strongest brand in the world. Everyone knows Apple. Jamf is helping businesses manage Apple devices safely, securely, and remotely. Jamf can ride Apple’s tailcoats and become a much larger company.
   * As businesses bring Apple devices into the work environment, Jamf will stand to benefit as the leading company that helps to manage these devices.

**Future Questions**

* **Do more enterprise customers offer employees the choice of Apple devices?**
   * As someone in finance, I rely on a Windows computer mostly for excel and other shortcuts, but are other industries as reliant on Windows? Oftentimes I prefer using an Apple device for the sleekness and the connection with other Apple products like Airpods, my iPhone, and much more, but can Apple extend beyond consumer products into enterprise products? I’m sure they have to some degree, but how common are Apple devices in the workplace and will they become more common/less common/or the same frequency?
* **What about Apple?**
   * The biggest risk to Jamf is arguably their relationship/competition with Apple. Apple has similar in-house products that are competitors to Jamf, but Apple hasn’t seen much success with this. Apple relies on Jamf for its own employees.
   * Does Apple try to compete with Jamf more head-on and build out the offerings to become more competitive? I’m not sure, but this is a small market relative to the size of Apple, and not sure if it’s worth Apple going after. Apple has its hands in a number of different industries like health and fitness, music and podcasts, and now Apple chips.

**Conclusion**

Jamf looks to be a great company that may benefit from Apple’s success. It will be interesting to see where Jamf is in 3+ years. I think this will be a successful company and given its small size ($3.9 billion), I can see this company being a multi-bagger one day.

There are still some key questions that need to be answered and my goal is only to provide you with a shallow dive that touches on the basic background of Jamf and any key questions that you may need to have in mind when doing your own research._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon to open two new hubs in Italy this year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-italy-hubs/amazon-to-open-two-new-hubs-in-italy-this-year-idUSKBN29N0QV

Hi folks, I need a proven stock app. And can anyone give some advice for a beginner in the world of stocks, I know something about stocks but I have never bought.

I also wonder if there is anyone who invests in the long run, is it worth it?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ADRs and China I've seen a few posts about ADRs recently talking about how all chinese stocks are based in the Cayman Islands and no one's really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements - As a disclaimer, before I go on, I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN, AAPL and a few other small AI companies.

While many of you may be technically correct about ADRs, it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China's foreign policy is being conducted right now - I'm not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I've noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power.

**Lets define what soft and hard power are**: I've taken these definitions from wikipedia, because they're concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced (damn teachers!)

Soft power: In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). In other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction - Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power

Hard Power: Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power

**Why is this important?:**

While China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet, there are more economically reliable countries (US) and countries with more functional military might (Russia and US) - I say functional here because military might isn't just man power and number of soldiers.

China uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy, through the use of censorship, coercion of officials, imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth. ([https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/))

However, they've also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors ([https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse)) - Now China doesn't want that to happen and to ensure it doesn't, it's followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership. However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that's where soft power comes in.

Throughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world's leading super power. Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia-pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu (16% vs 22%) ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal)). While this gives it more economic power, it also gives china great headlines!

This isn't the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power - For a long time, China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world ([https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:\~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy).), pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year - so to not only improve their citizens lives (though how much of the main motivation that is I'm very skeptical) but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two, China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives, so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world.

Let's be clear though, the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument.

**How Soft power relates to ADRs and Stocks?**

For China to successfully follow through with their plans (leveraging soft power into economic might - the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: I know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. So how does this relate the ADRs:

If China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. Every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs. I know I wouldn't be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy

Disinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock - The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies - and while I'm sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up Deng Xiaoping's China reform and opening-up policy).

And to address comments that I'm sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - I'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea. The chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.

Of course if anyone thinks I'm wrong, please let me know - I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I've gone into it because of Jack Ma's Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.

**TLDR: China would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn't honor their ADR agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval - I could be wrong though**

Edit: Hong Kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument, but I would say that to a certain extent, Banks knew HK would be bought under the CCP and still think they can make money there - also Hong Kong massively damaged Chinese Soft power and if there had been a better president I think the effect would have been huge but there wasn't and the markets are over it - if ADRs aren't honoured, then Banks and hedge funds would lose money and I think that that's their bottom line and a red line for them - I could be wrong though_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Almost guaranteed FDA approval for AUP on Jan 22 With all the hype surrounding medical-related stocks, I decided to look at the coming FDA approval dates. The FDA will decide the approval of a drug created by AUPH called Voclosporin on January 22nd (This Friday), a drug that only has one other competitor in the market now.

\- Voclospoin has a near-guaranteed chance of being approved with its stage three trials performed over a year ago basically meeting the FDA approval requirements.

\- Once FDA approval arrives, estimates of AUPH revenues generated from this drug will be $1.5B to $3B a year

\- The company has great financials including over $400M in cash

\- Insiders of AUPH have huge holdings in AUPH stock, with the chairman George M. Milne buying 20,000 shares (over a quarter of a million) of AUPH in December, which increases his stake to more than half a million. 

I believe the stock will go up to around $23 once FDA approval arrives. This prediction is based on what happened back in 2019 when stage 3 clinical trials were released and the stock went to $21. All analysts currently have a "Buy Rating" on the stock and the average PT is well over $20, with many saying it can be $30.

I’ve just completed my first year in the market but I admittedly made learning about taxes a non priority. I completely understand the long vs short rates, the brackets and some other things. I do however have two questions that I was hoping some of you may be able to help answer. Btw, I use TDA. 

1. The bulk of my strategy is under 1 year positions with few over 1 year.  The question I have, which may be dumb, is do I pay those actual taxes when I sell my positions or do I pay the Feds a bulk amount at the end of the year or at some cadenced time frame?

2. Does the cost basis on TDA help with this?  It doesn’t seem the cost basis doesn’t account for taxes but I could be wrong.  

Thanks all_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the consequence of investing in stock with extraordinarily high P/E I know there are bad and good reasons for P/E to be high.  The main good reason is future potential.  However, if P/E exceeds even the wildest, utopian future for a stock and it'll never even achieve a fraction of its current valuation, what is the outcome?

There are certain stocks that I've either sold or avoided because I can't justify the price despite the tempting growth.

One of those being Shopify (SHOP).  I'm a big fan and the current environment would certainly testify to its continued success.  Moreover, most analysts online still recommend it.

However, it's P/E will \*never\* be obtained.  It's over 4 times higher than Amazon and I sure as hell would always choose Amazon over Shopify (though I love Shopify).

I'll also add that Shopify has tons of cash and a great CEO.

So, I guess my question is--if all things are perfect for Shopify--will the P/E still eventually hammer the share down by a large amount?

Let's say there's a large correction in the market of 30%, would SHOP go down 30% (essentially on par with other stocks, including Amazon) or would it suffer a worse fate due to its incredible valuation?

There have been multiple threads posted to Reddit recently touting the potential that the Uranium industry has over the next few years. Specifically, /u/3stmotivation has done a terrific job with his(?) due diligence regarding the industry. If you had bought in to any of his recommendations back in June after reading his thread in /r/Undervalued here: [The undervalued case for uranium companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undervalued/comments/gz833b/the_undervalued_case_for_uranium_companies/), then you likely would've been up 27% on the large cap Cameco(CCJ), 128% on Denison(DNN), and 155% on Energy Fuels(UUUU). He is not the only one expecting Uranium to make huge gains, however, but I would like to use his work as a case study so that we can get an idea of what to expect for the industry. Just as a note, I decided to largely leave fundamentals of the companies and technical analysis out of this post. I can provide info about how I feel about them as well, but decided to put them on hold for now.

**What is the purpose of this post?**

Simple. When I read these posts about the Uranium industry having the potential to explode in the near future, I *rarely* came across reasons as to why it *wouldn't* skyrocket. Before buying in, I decided to dive deeper into reactive core to see what I could come up with.

**The current situation, summed up:**

If you haven't read through Uranium investment material, I'll sum it up now. The lack of supply does not meet the current and 10 year expected demand. Because of this, the biggest producers are buying from the spot market because it's cheaper to do that than to re-open their facilities for new production. It's predicted that when spot prices hit $50+, these companies can get back to work and make great earnings while doing so. 

I'd like to be clear here... This is not untrue. Contracts will likely be renewed over the next couple years, starting now, driving prices up. 

**Uranium voices say we'll have a repeat of sky high prices during '07 and/or '11.**

Remember Fukushima? The Japanese Nuclear disaster in 2011 that shut down many facilities, driving Uranium supply up and prices back down? An important piece to the puzzle of investing in a company is public perception and there is no difference when it comes to commodities. For this exercise however, I frankly don't care what the public's perception is. The *reality* is that Nuclear power is safer and reduces carbon more effectively than every other way we produce power. Nuclear power is only getting **safer** because of these kinds of disasters. Regulations are incredibly strict when it comes to Nuclear power because of the implications, bringing my first point into focus...

**Uranium *can't* be competitive.**

Industries that are forced to comply with significant safety standards set by government regulations cannot adapt quickly to a changing economy. With that said, the companies that have survived this sector are well suited to withstand the regulations they're forced to deal with. But mooning? That's out of the equation.

**Renewable Energy is the future/can't power the entire grid.**

Renewable energy can't power the entire grid and it's not our only future. The reality is that our future is made up of Renewables, Nuclear, Fossil Fuels, and a healthy balance of other energy sources. Why is this the case? Many reasons. Fossil fuels will run out and harm the environment, renewables aren't as productive or reliable and take up a lot of space at the same time, and Nuclear is damn expensive and takes forever to get running. Let's look at this last point...

**Nuclear is expensive and takes *forever* to get running.**

It costs *billions* of dollars to get a new Nuclear facility up and running. Natural gas takes a fraction of the cost. Nuclear, while turning a profit at a better rate and with less carbon output than Natural Gas, also takes *at least a half decade* to even be built. Out pacing a Natural Gas facility's profitability doesn't begin until nearly a decade *after* a Nuclear facility is built. And that's *without* further technological improvements of Natural Gas facilities bringing costs down further. Who exactly has 10-15 years and billions of dollars to spend on an endeavor that will likely need heavily regulated maintenance and repairs shortly after profitability outpaces its competitors? 

**Not politicians, that's for sure.**  

The billion dollar price tag for Nuclear can only be covered by 1 purse, the political purse. Let me ask you this, how many high level representatives can you name that have been in positions of power for 15 years? The way you advance in politics is by winning and you have a short time frame to do that. Investing yourself in legislation that pumps up Nuclear energy, against horrible public perception, will not net you the quick wins needed to continue moving up the ladder. No one wants a part of this like they do Renewables or even Natural Gas.

**So is Uranium actually worth investing in?**

The short answer? It *could* be, but only for the intermediate term. 3STmotivation specifically mentions a horizon over the next few years and how important it is to keep an eye on spot prices and the industry when we get a few years down the road. Based on what I've learned during my research, this is not a long term play until *significant* improvements are made for Nuclear.

**What about for the intermediate term?**

During the bull run from mid 2010 to the beginning of 2011, CCJ, DNN, and UUUU shot up about 65%, 150%, and nearly 500% respectively. Unfortunately, over the following 6 month time frame, they lost basically all of those gains and have been in decline for the 10 years since. Fukushima played its part with reassuring the public that Nuclear was dangerous and may have been a catalyst for this meltdown, but the continual decline in value is evident. These are huge gains, no doubt, but be understanding of the industry as a whole and how the market reacts before buying in.

**Final thoughts:**

I ultimately decided ***not*** to buy into Uranium. I think the industry is Undervalued for a reason, ie. valued appropriately. My investment strategy does not include investing or trading commodities so it was easier to pass on this, but that is not to say money cannot be made here. I simply don't believe this to be a long term play and the short/intermediate term is too volatile, difficult to fully grasp, and risky for most investors. 3STmotivation provided great analysis of the industry and the companies that are probably best equipped to benefit from the upcoming catalysts, so I thank him for encouraging my research.

EDIT: There is an overwhelming amount of "advice" about investing in this company, which is fine, but the point of this thread is to gather user experience to determine what the sentiment is of boots on the ground. Part of my due diligence about this company is finding out how the users like it, not hearing the same regurgitated $1000 in 1 year garbage, or "it's a sure thing".

I would urge anyone with experience using it to be critical, as I think the comments going against everyones confirmation bias are likely the most important.

EDIT EDIT: It's really unfortunate that people are downvoting critical comments of the software, as those are exactly the types of comments this thread is meant to be embracing. Before you downvote, try and wrap your head around the context of the thread. I would also say, that downvoting things that oppose your confirmation bias is VERY revealing about the state of this sub and others - anyone should see that as alarming.

EDIT EDIT EDIT: It's interesting to note that those two comments have a significant number of upvotes since I have referenced them. It's hard to reconcile the overwhelming positivity in this thread with the echoed sentiment on those comments. Something just doesn't add up to me. It tells me that more people entering this thread are of the opinion that the software isn't all it is cracked up to be, but the comments here don't match.

A user (u/eqpofr) had asked in a comment sure to get buried:

"Can commenters state in what context they used the software, and what their main tasks were, in addition to whether they liked the software or not? Context matters a lot and it's lacking in the discourse I'm seeing here"

But, the current market scenario could be bullish/bearish. Honestly the obvious answer would be on a long term any value stock would make returns irrespective of when you invest. But as a retail investor it's practically scary to add lumpsums to buy stocks in bulk. I'm trying to find and arrive at a factor or a multiplier that decides how much to invest that week/month based on market conditions.`eg: say 'A' is the factor,"this week amount to be invested" = A X (planned lumpsum remaining for the month).`The factor 'A' should fluctuate based on the market conditions.

Ok..i dont know if this is a tax question or stock question so forgive me if i am in the wrong forum...but here is the story:

I am, right now, in the process of filling out my 2020 taxes and I am filling out the 8949 form.

I have owned 500 shares of Apple stock since 2014.

When the market crashed in March 2020 due to global covid shut down i day traded apple stock twice (with margin for the first time in my life) in the month. I bought 1,000 shares one day and the next day i sold the 1000 shares....a few weeks later i did the same thing...in and out with 1,000 shares, using margin...never touching my original 500 shares ive had since 2014.

Those two day trades just made me a couple of grand...nothing major..just a few bucks which was the intent..i am NOT A day trader...i just jumped on a quick chance to make a quick buck.

So today Im looking at my 1099 form from brokerage firm to fill out the 8949 form for taxes and under short term buy/sell i see the two apple transactions: a buy/sell of  500 shares of apple and two weeks later a buy/sell of 1,000 shares of apple.

Then in my long term buy/sell i see 500 shares of apple buy/sell with the same sell date as the short term trasnaction....and a $69,000 gain!!!! 

I dont ever remember having $69,000 cash in my td account..ever!!!!

It seems one of the 1000 shares of apple fell under a short term gain but the other 1000 shares of apple was split between a short term gain and a long term gain.....

How can that happen?!??? Granted i always had the 500 shares from 2014 i never touched.

So now i have to pay taxes on $69,000 which i dont even know where the 69k is at?!?!?

When i look at my March 2020 broker statement, it shows both 1000 shares of apple transactions as margin buys and sells...and i dont see either transaction showing a $69,000 gain.

I am confused AF!!!...im looking at my brokerage account online and looking for the paper trail, so to speak, and i have yet to see anytime i had $69,000 in my cash account.

Im gonna get DRILLED on taxes now. Im freaking the F out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on RLX and PLTK?

Dear Investor,

Jeff Bezos stunned investors when he revealed that one emerging technology is the key to Amazon’s future success…

In fact, Bezos argues that “it’s hard to overstate the impact” of this “powerful trend.”

The CEO of ARK Investments, a fund with over $10 billion under management, took Bezos statement one step further: “We think [it] could approach $17 trillion in market cap — which would be 35 Amazons.”

WHAT in the world could be worth 35 Amazons?

The answer is a radical breakthrough that Wired says is “the rocket fuel of the AI boom.”

And they’re not alone in seeing it that way…

A Shark Tank billionaire says AI will create the world’s first trillionaire

Elon Musk is contributing to a $1 billion investment in this technology

Even super investor Warren Buffett says that it's "enormously disruptive" and will have a "hugely beneficial social effect”

When so many successful people are all saying the same thing, it usually pays to listen.

Which is why this giant leap forward has Bay Street insiders seeing dollar signs.

And if you’re a Canadian investor, I haven’t even told you the best part…

Because there's one remarkable Canadian company that's absolutely dominating this booming market.

This TSX-listed company is only about 1% the size of Amazon, yet they’ve already begun introducing this ground-breaking technology to the market.

So with everything I’m hearing coming out of Silicon Valley and Bay Street…

I don’t feel like I’m very far out on a limb with this “bold” prediction:

Five years from now, you’ll probably wish you’d bought this TSX stock.

And the good news is that you can find out all about this company and this incredible technology today.

Because we’ve laid out the full story on this “powerful trend” in an exclusive report.

And you are going to want to see this free report before you invest $1 on any tech company.

Because inside you’ll discover why some mega-rich investors are racing to cash-in on this tech trend.

And how one tiny TSX stock could be your best bet to profit from this incredible tech revolution…

But if you want to get in on this opportunity, I encourage you to act quickly.

Because the story of the coming boom is already starting to leak out, and this trend looks ready to take off.

Whenever I see data for percent ownership of a publicly traded company, I've noticed that the percent insider and percent institution ownership doesn't add up to 100%. Is the other percent owned by just retail investors?

For example, UBER's stock says that 1.96% is owned by insiders and 74.88% is owned by institutions. This adds up to 76.84%. Does this mean the other 23.16% is owned by retail investors or is there another group I'm missing?

Hi, Reddit. This is my first time posting here. So recently I saved some money that I can afford to invest, but I'm a newbie in all this so was thinking to ask for advice here.

After some time reading about investing I got the conclusion that Catherine Wood\`s ETF\`s are one of the best. Compared to the traditional S&P 500 and vanguard ETF\`s which normally vary around 7-15 % return for the past couple of years Catherine ETF\`s returns are 300%.

In addition, her investing covers all new and upcoming fields like genome editing and autonomous tech. So I was considering investing in her, rather than the traditional funds. Here is her website  [ARK Invest | We Believe Innovation Is Key to Growth (ark-invest.com)](https://ark-invest.com/)

My question is what do you think would be the correct action? I was thinking of allocating all the +- $2000 in most of her ETF\`s so that I have a portion of everything. Eventually contributing more now and then when I have some cash left.

I have some individual stock like NIO, Plug, General Motors and American Airlines, but I have doubts for long term individual stock investing.  I really wanna make the right choice.

Also, what are better platforms for her ETF\`s and potentially any others? My account is being reviewed in Interactive Brokers, but I sense it\`s more professional-oriented and I am sorta pleb in this field. I have revolut investing, but there are only individual stock there.

(Canadian) Hey guys, turning 30 this year and finally realized I should start putting my savings to use. :P So last week I downloaded wealthsimple and opened 3 accounts: the default personal, a tfsa, and an rrsp and I expect my funds to be deposited around Tuesday. I’ve been doing some reading and watching videos while I wait and what I plan to do is:

Personal account: start out small, investing in med-long hold stocks just to see how it goes. Starting with about 2k, thinking split between NIO, AAPL, AMD, SUNW, and maybe a couple other more stable growth companies. I’m not looking forward to learning how to deal with stocks on my taxes and probably paying taxes for the first time in my life but it’s a necessary chore.

TFSA: from my understanding, to not be taxed (the purpose of the account) these have to be Canadian, so I plan on pumping the full 6k into Canadian EFTs, probably half ZQQ, and either VFV or VCN for the rest.

RRSP: I plan on putting only American EFTs here since it sounds like you don’t pay any taxes on American stocks if it’s through an RRSP. I don’t make much money so I can only contribute about 5k a year which I plan to go about 3k ARKK, and the remaining 2k on another EFT, I haven’t quite decided yet.

I was quite surprised to read that you can’t just dump 20k into an RRSP if you have it, just because you are on a lower income, but I guess it makes sense to prevent people from going ham and losing all their money? So I guess I just have to be patient with this and the TFSA.

So from my understanding: personal account is for stocks you might not hold onto long, TFSA is for long hold stocks but will still be taxed if not Canadian, and RRSP is for any market and won’t be taxed until traded but you can’t easily access.

Would greatly appreciate any critique on whether I’m making a big mistake with any of this or it sounds relatively safe? Or makes sense even? Thank you!

Edit: thank you so much to everyone who clarified things for me, I now realize a TFSA is the way to go for pretty much everything since the limit is much higher than I thought and the tax on dividends doesn’t sound too bad. I’ll have to take the L in my RRSP since I’ve already deposited the money but it’s still an investment so can’t complain too much! :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market Website for Betting money?

(I can't post the charts in* r/stocks*) But I have them if you would like to take a look.* 

*The markets ended down last week and Monday is MLK. Here is what I will be watching for on Monday, and when the markets open on Tuesday.* 

&#x200B;

**Stocks**

**$PLTR -** Last week I bought a couple of $30 March calls and it looks like this one is setting up for a big upwards push. I'd recommend getting into some calls around a $25 underlying value. This one can easily be in the money, but it is one of the more volatile ones. 

**$AMD**  is setting up for a run to $100 just like I wrote about last week. Currently my $100 April call is down, however I am considering rolling it or buying more this week. Let's see how it plays out. We still have plenty of time, one good spike on the underlying could put us in the profit. 

**$ICLN** I will be watching to buy more LEAPS. I'm not concerned with any short term price dips. 

**$LI & $XPEV** These are both Chinese EV manufacturers that have huge momentum in China. The cars are very nice and I believe these are both undervalued. Currently, I have a $40 March $LI call that is down a little bit. Both of these I expect to have a big upward move the next time the EV market does, which is all the time recently. I'll be watching this one more carefully, but I don't expect them to fall much more. 

**$SOLO** is an interesting Canadian EV manufacturer. I put this in the same category as the above two. Wait for a pull back further before getting in if you already have other EV stocks. It's always best to keep diversifying. 

**$TRXC** is a medical device and instruments company that has made a robotic system and SurgiBot system that can perform surgeries while controlling multiple arms and a camera simultaneously. This is most likely where the future of surgery is headed and getting in on these companies now will have big upside. This one is cheap, $2 at time of writing, so I am thinking of just buying the underlying or some LEAPS. I'd be cautious and go small on this one. 

**$PRNT** Wait for a pull back to buy commons of LEAPS. 

**$BA** Airliners are not going anywhere. Let's take a look at the chart. I'm a buyer at $190/$185/$180. I don't believe that the new admin will shut everything down again, so this is still a covid discount stock. 

**$THCX** Decriminalization is imminent and a vote is near. Legalization is a possibility in this administration although I don't think it would come anytime soon. I will be waiting to buy LEAPS, commons, or start selling covered puts. Preferably I would wait until this gap is filled to buy it; I am not brave enough to buy puts for this yet, however it is an option. RSI looks like its tipping over, and MACD is showing overbought. Keeping a close watch on this one. 

Keep watching **$QQQ, $SMH** and **$SPY** for potential opportunities to get in and out. The markets are near or at all time highs now and has been trending steeply up for a long period of time. **Don't be surprised if there is a pull back soon.**   Take a look at the triple Q chart below:  

I would not at all be surprised if this pulled back to the $300 support level. By no means do I expect a huge crash, but since the pandemic crash in March there has ben two clear pull backs. Luckily, both have bounced on support. Do not fear fellow traders, this is a good thing and just means we will be buying more if that happens. My take is to go small right now; in and out. Play it safe. Even sometimes sitting on the sidelines is better than getting injured.

 *Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed and found this helpful!!*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Call Contracts Correct me if I’m wrong I would always buy calls/puts but a friend recently explained it in much more detail and said to make money while holding shares. So technically speaking let’s say Fuel-Cell is at $16 rn and I have 100 shares. If I’m going to hold this long term. I should be constantly selling call contracts making money from premiums but also making sure the let’s say “$23 price target for feb 19th” doesn’t actually reach so I can collect premiums while also believing the share value will continue to rise long term and keeping my shares. So it’s finding a sweet spot where I make money from shares rising and premium but the shares not going beyond the call price where I have to sale. And even if it hits $23 I’m making a $700 profit from the sold shares plus the $128 premium I received. Only way to lose in this scenario is holding the shares through the aloted time of contract and the shares drop like crazy. But realistically money can be recovered by doing many more call options sells.

I think there’s a 100% chance you guys are about to laugh at my stupidity, but...

I messed up and bought a call on something that I’m pretty much believing is going to tank. I’m down $200, with potentially $90 left to go, which I have reason to believe I’m going to hit on Tuesday. Could I potentially buy a put and cut my loses? Or is that just going to double my loss?

Feel free to roast me, thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AAPL and DSNY Seems these two are sinking. But I highly doubt they will keep sinking ? what are you guys predicting ? I have been riding this train for 3 months and haven’t made any gains...

TWS has a demo account but TS does not. I have two questions about TS stock chart. 

1) real time premarket data in charts start from 4am, or later? TWS starts from 4am. I know TS only allows trades after 8am. I am just wondering if premarket data in chart also starts late.

2) when premarket data is displayed along with regular trading hour data,  60 min candle is aligned with 9am or 9:30am? TWS has hourly candle aligned with 9am not market opening time. I honestly don't like it. I am just wondering if TS does the same thing.

If anyone can answer me these two questions, I would be really appreciated!

Then reinvest that $4000 into another stock, and sell it which gives me a profit of $500, bringing my total to $4500, do I have to pay taxes on that $500 gain even if I'm still in the red on my total investments by $500?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Yet another reddit stock screener  got bored today so wrote a very simple bot that scans most of the investing sub reddits, finds the most talked about **Recently** and tries to predict the sentiment as well as the price target for the next working day. It doesn't do some crazy AI stuff like some other bots that have been posted here.

**What's the point of this?**

I'm quite busy during the week so I don't have time to sit down for hours and go through posts, find interesting tickers, analyse general sentiment, do DD, so with the help of this bot, I can cut down a few hours worth of work every day. I can just do some DD on the list of stocks that it spits out.

**Future expansions?**

Well as of now, all it does is show me the stocks that are most talked about, as I collect data everyday, I plan to filter out symbols that are mentioned frequently and only watch for stocks that are gaining traction recently. Adding to that, do some technical analysis on it and look for Bullish/Bearish/Breakout patterns, I could also do some DD like researching the CEO, analysing google search results, Glassdoor reviews, analysing the financials. There's a lot stuff that I can potentially automate which could count as DD.

Since some of the stocks on the list are banned on r/stocks, I've not included the table here. I'll leave a comment down below which shows the output. FYI, it filters out WSB popular stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is DIV a good choice for holding right now? I’ve got most of my portfolio in ETFs but heard good things about DIV.

Fairly new to stock trading so I just wanted to know if anyone could forward me onto some good websites to learn for myself or even list some great tips onto how start of with stock trading.

Buy low & sell high right!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where could I check my calculations for the fundamental analysis? Hello, im rather new to stocks and recently I tried calculating some metrics for the fundamental analysis, such as the P/E ratio or the Return On Equity. But, because im also very new to reading these balance sheets or financial statements, im not so sure whether I picked the right numbers and wanted to ask if there is such thing as a place where you could ,,discuss" your results or just see if you did it correctly? 

Another question: How important is using data out of the same quarter? Maybe thats a dumb question, but for this one I used most financial data from the Q3 2020 report, while stuff like the market cap were from like today. Is that a big problem and if it is, would the perfect time for an fundamental analysis be right after the reports release?

I hope you can help me out!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO & PLUG Yo newbie here, are NIO and PLUG good stocks to invest in considering the dip? How do ya’ll think these stocks will do in the next year or two?

Figured if I'm going to spend so much time doing due diligence on stocks, why am I not transferring that information over somewhere else where I can save others the time. This weekend I finally dived into a stock I've been interested in for months: iRobot

The first thing I always look at on a stock, before I even know much about who they are and what they do is their fundamentals. If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense. Here are the key things I personally care most about and how iRobot stacks up:

Financials:

* Total Current Assets > Total Current Liabilities : YES

>Not only is TCA>TCL, TCA is bigger than Total Liabilities, by 226 million. I take that into consideration when figuring out what my target market cap will be later.

* 5yr avg Net Inc / Grs Inc : 14.33%

>The magic number is usually 20%+ for me, but 10-20% can work too if its among the top of its competitors in that field. Some fields are harder to get 20% than others.

* 5yr Rev Gain Avg YOY : 17.27%

>What I HAVE to see here is a positive number. How high it is will factor into how much I feel the target share price should be later when I calculate it. 1-10% is fine. Anything 10% or higher is great. Should be really high if its a super young fast growing company like a NET, NIO, etc. For an established 10 yr + old company like iRobot to be 17.27% is impressive.

* 5yr Net Inc Gain Avg YOY : 20.36%

>Beautiful. Much like the rev gain, we need a positive number and 10+ is great. If a company has net income gain faster than rev gain like this means its probably from organic growth and/or efficiency too.

* Profit Margin 5 yr Avg : 6.86% / TTM : 7%

>Its optimal to see 10% or higher, however this is another category that can vary very much by what business the company operates in. So what I need to look further into is whether 7% is as good as their competitors.

* Shares Outstaning Trend: Up a tad from 10-5 yrs ago, then back down a tad now, so “flat”.

>You want to see this number go down over time as its increasing the value of each individual share. Selling more shares in and of itself isn’t necessarily a no-go, but if they are selling shares they better be showing mind-blowing growth and be at a reasonably price for me to want to buy.

* Free Cash Flows Past 5 yrs: 18/105/53/40/95 (mil)

>FCF can vary quite a bit year to year for a variety of reasons so I like to just look at them over a long stretch of 5 or 10 years and make sure that the overall theme is that its increasing, even if it has a down year here or there. Doubling in 5 yr is impressive, going up 500% in 5 yrs is incredible.

* PE : TTM = 16.5, FWD = 25.3 ($89.21 / 0.93 Bil Mkt Cap)

>PE is last because its least important. Really by this point I know kinda if the company is quick growing and thus deserves a like 20+ PE or not. It really is just helping me see if this is a good time to buy from a value standpoint if I've liked what I've seen so far. A 16.5 trailing PE for a company with the stats we've seen so far is very attractive. Good growth, excellent balance sheet, great cash flow growth, love what I see, need to dive in.

Questions:

>Ok, so overall I love what I see and am considering them a potential buy and worthy of doing more due diligence. What questions do I want to answer about iRobot:

1. Is 14.33% Net Inc/ Grs Inc average for its competitors?
2. Is 7% Prof Mgn avg for its competitors?
3. What are all products and services they have?
4. Growth Plans?
5. Do they have a “moat”?

Answers:

1. Anker = 14.57% / Roborock = 42.4% / Ecovac = 18.9% / iRobot = 14.33%

>So its proven difficult to really name another company as a true peer in this industry. Other American companies who make robot household items don’t really do solely that, so I may not find apples to apples comparisons for the numbers. I decided on Anker Innovations Ltd, Ecovacs and Roborock, all are Chinese companies so I don’t really know if I trust their numbers (especially Roborocks seem too good to be true).

2. Anker = 9.76% / Roborock = 26.48% / Ecovac = 4.49% / iRobot = 7%

>So iRobot seems to be right on par with Anker and Ecovac, while all three are getting blown away by Roborock. It seems pretty much implausible for Roborock to be almost three times more efficient at its business than its biggest competitors, I don’t know that I trust their financials. I’m inclined to basically call this a wash overall and say iRobot is on par with competitors in its sector. I won't call this a plus in the iRobot column, but I won't call it a negative either. Also of note, their TTM Profit margin is up to 9%, so there’s progress.

3. 

>Robot Vacuums (Roomba), Robot Mop (Braava), Tutoring Robot (Root) which teaches coding and is not a revenue source, more of a outreach and PR tool so not too important. They also have a lawn mowing robot (Terra) about to launch in Germany and then US later.

4. 

>The industry itself still has huge room for revenue growth as it hasn’t fully caught on yet, but the slow growing trend has accelerated with COVID. Their penetration rate as a whole among all vacuum sales is 10%, with 20% of all vacuum sales being robotic (so around half of all robovacs sold are Roombas). They seem to have good brand name loyalty and are developing word of mouth. The aforementioned Terra hopes to launch in 2021 according to latest earnings call. While they wouldn’t explicitly state it, the color in the earnings call hinted a few times that they will also be moving into more of a services side of income in addition to profiting off the products. If I had to guess probably will be their “Genius Platform” that creates a network in the home that their products share, learning where each furniture is, doing jobs at owner’s ideal times, being more specific like “clean around kitchen table” instead of just “clean kitchen”.

5. 

>While I would call them the leader in their field, they would come up shy of something I would call a moat. They already have a handful of competitors. They make the best robovac and mop from a quality standpoint and definitely seem to be the best in the automated and AI side of vacs, but I see it as a field where they will be steadily working just to hold the leading market share, not massively grow it.

Headwinds:

>Supply chain issues have plagued several companies in 2020 with COVID, but iRobot in earnings calls claims they have managed to navigate those surprisingly well and their financials showed that to be true. Their major issue is the 20% China-USA tariff hamstringing them from having more net income and cash flow. To avoid that tariff they had planned to spend 2020 moving a lot of production from China to Malaysia, but of course COVID has dramatically slowed that progress and it's now their goal in 2021. Over time, other mid and large companies may add robovacs to their products and increase competition for market share.

Tailwinds:

>Steadily increasing penetration rates into the overall households market, increasing brand recognition, a successful move to Malaysia would help financials a lot, COVID got many people more interested in robovacs after spending so much time in the home.

Market Sentiment vs My Sentiment:

>At one point this stock and some other robotics/automated stocks were a fad and IRBT had a run up. Since then sexier trends have come like EVs, solar, MJ, etc and left IRBT stock a bit by the wayside. Some growth investors may have moved off it onto other plays as iRobot’s revs slowed a touch from their early days. I chalk the stock’s volatility up to people moving off the fad onto the next one.  
>  
>To me it now seems like a sleeper stock, who has strong growth and quality, selling products that I see steady penetration rates upcoming in. Once their production is moved they will be bringing in 20% more money on most of production by avoiding the China - US tariff. That will improve profit margin and net income, the two financials that weren’t meeting my targets. These great financials are going mostly under the radar right now, but once that factory is done and the extra money shows up on a couple earnings I expect word will spread and the stock will eventually see a run. Its a merge of a company in a field of the future, while being at a good price from a value perspective.

Am I Buying Now?

>What I see here is a company that isn't a homerun value play (right now @$89, would be at -$85) nor a homerun growth play, but good at both and good enough financials where I feel comfortable holding them in my portfolio. The factory move helps them avoid their only major headwind. If it weren’t for its slightly volatile stock performance over the last few years, I would be gung ho to jump right in now and target a 15% gain or so when it gets attention. With stocks like this I want to try to use that volatility to my advantage. Its a good enough price right now to start a small entry position of 1 % of the portfolio or so, then if volatility kicks in I would love to DCA down and keep adding to the position with every 2 or 3% drop in its price. Once the market catches on and it gets close to overvalued territory I would gladly sell and take profit. I see it a good stock for the next few years, but one that in the long run most likely will have too many competitors if all things stayed equal. I currently value them around $95 going off their revenue YOY growth, net inc YOY growth, FCF growth and good potential in the next year or two if the Malaysia move pans out.
