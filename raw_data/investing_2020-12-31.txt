 Moving money out of LendingClub and into XYZ broker Because LendingClub no longer allows investors to purchase notes, I need to move my Roth IRA (available balance, I've still got active notes) out to a broker. My preferred choice would be WeBull. I called LC and they've given me my STRATA number.

However, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it. WeBull app (transfer account page) doesn't list Lendingclub nor does the input of the DTC number (my STRATA number?) do anything.

Anyone been through this scenario? My Roth at LC is sitting there doing nothing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2020 Stock Market Thesis Today a funny thought came to mind.

I remember a year or two ago I watched a TED Talk on an individual who monitored penny stock pump and dump emails.

He noticed how they had a very observable effect on price.

He showed how the first ones were black and white text.  Then when people got use to that they would switch to color and vibrancy and how it would have the same effect as the black and white did when they were new.

Then with spam folders how they had to switch up structure and such.

What I started to realize is that with venues like WSB and the Crypto headlines we have created a new style of the Pump and Dump in an almost indirect way.

I think what will be most interesting about this is because this development has a feedback loop and takes place on the general market versus just penny stocks or pink sheet trades it gives more validity to what individuals perceive.

How this will all turn out?  I am not sure but I think in 2021 we will see a conclusion and it will be very interesting Lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is the market underestimating the outcome of the Georgia elections next week? I’m surprised to see volatility trading low this week. The market seems to have priced in a Republican led congress, however, the 2 Georgia runoffs next week can drastically change things. In the event the Democrats win Georgia, we may see more volatility. 

Betting markets are signaling some confidence in the Republican Party’s prospects, while polls indicate a slight advantage for Democrats.


https://www.marketwatch.com/story/betting-markets_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst? A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of "Tesla is not a car company" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. "Buy the dip" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV battery parts. Repost from r/pennystocks that's worth taking a look at.  Best hidden undervalued (Penny) Stock to buy now? And will this be a game-changer in the lithium mining world? Lake Resources NL (ASX:LKE, OTC: LLKKF)

[https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/934968/lake-resources-high-purity--clean--lithium-carbonate-to-be-used-for-first-lithium-ion-battery-test-cells-at-novonix-934968.html](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/934968/lake-resources-high-purity--clean--lithium-carbonate-to-be-used-for-first-lithium-ion-battery-test-cells-at-novonix-934968.html)

**<<Long post alert>>**

Summarized, why I think this stock has so much potential is (in short) because the technology they use will be a game-changer in the lithium mining world. It will **reduce the time** from brine extraction **from months/years to few hours!** It is **sustainable**, **low costs efficient**. It is backed by **Bill gates** and somewhere in a video I'm not sure, but I also heard the name **Jeff Bezos**. They own many lakes to operate in it.

Their current milestone is waiting for the sample results they send to their partner Novonix (NVNXF). They will be given a PR soon about it.

Before I want to get into the company details, let me show you the current state/background of the lithium mining world. I collected some articles below. (sources at the end below)

*Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene.* *Lithium production from clay sources* *is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.*

*Lithium is a metal commonly used in batteries like the rechargeable ones found in laptops, cellphones, and electric cars as well as in ceramics and glass. It is the lightest metal on Earth and is soft enough to be cut with a knife when in its elemental form.*

*Demand has soared in recent years as carmakers move toward electric vehicles, as* *many countries including the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Canada* *announce a phase-out of combustion-engine cars. In fact,* *five times more lithium than is mined currently is going to be necessary to meet global climate targets by 2050*\*, according to the World Bank.\*

*But there’s one big problem. Obtaining lithium by conventional means takes its own environmental toll, or rather three: carbon emissions, water and land.*

*Lithium is currently sourced mainly from hard rock mines, such as those in Australia, or underground brine reservoirs below the surface of dried lake beds, mostly in Chile and Argentina. Hard rock mining – where the mineral is extracted from open pit mines and then roasted using fossil fuels – leaves scars in the landscape, requires a large amount of water and releases 15 tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of lithium, according to an analysis by the raw materials experts Minviro for the lithium and geothermal energy firm Vulcan Energy Resources. The other conventional option, extracting lithium from underground reservoirs, relies on even more water to extract the lithium – and it takes place in typically very water-scarce parts of the world, leading to indigenous communities questioning their sustainability.*

*Extracting lithium from geothermal waters – found not just in Cornwall, but Germany and the US as well – has a tiny environmental footprint in comparison, including very low carbon emissions.*

*Geothermal brine is a hot, concentrated saline solution that has circulated through very hot rocks and become enriched with elements such as lithium, boron and potassium. In other words, the energy-intensive process of extracting lithium from solid rock is powered by naturally occurring geothermal energy. The brine in the Cornish mines has concentrations of up to 260 milligrams per litre, flowing at a rate of between 40-60 litres (8.1 to 13.7 gallons) per second. That works out as about enough lithium for a typical smartphone battery (2-3g) passing through the production process every few seconds, according to Cornish Lithium’s estimates.*

*The demand for lithium with a lower environmental footprint appears to be gaining ground. There are signs car manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are starting to think about the environmental and social impact of their electric vehicle supply chain, says Alex Keynes, clean vehicles manager at Brussels-based campaign organisation Transport and Environment. Using lithium that is already in circulation – from recycled batteries and electronics – is preferable to mining more, says Keynes. “Given the enormous demand we’re likely to see over the coming years, \[it\] is going to mean we need some extraction, and recovering lithium from geothermal brine looks very promising,” says Keynes.*

*The speed of lithium extraction from brine deposits could be significantly increased using a technique recently developed by an international team of scientists.*

*The new filtration technique mimics the capabilities of living cells and has been tailored specifically to filter lithium ions in an “ultra-fast, one-directional and highly-selective manner”.*

*According to the researchers, the technology — which remains in an early stage — could one day reduce lithium-from-brine extraction times from several months to just a matter of hours*\*.\*

*They have said they are hopeful the technique will be able to provide “a clear roadmap for resource recovery”, as well as for other uses such as “low-energy water purification” — noting the particular* *benefit of greater lithium availability to “enabling electric vehicles and grid integration of renewable energy sources*\*”.\*

*It is the* *latest in a series of lithium extraction technology breakthroughs*\*, as researchers around the world seek ways to make access to this increasingly-important mineral easier and more cost-effective.\*

**The company**

Lake Resources NL (ASX:LKE, OTC: LLKKF) is a clean lithium developer utilising direct extraction technology for production ofsustainable, high purity lithium from its flagship Kachi Project within the Lithium Trianglein Argentina among other projects covering 200,00 ha. This direct extraction method delivers a solution for two rising demands of electric vehicle batteries –high purity battery materials to avoid performance issues, and more sustainable, responsibly sourced materials.

1 Clean-Tech: Efficient, disruptive, cost-competitive technology using well-known water treatment re-engineered for lithium (not mining). Technology partner, Lilac Solutions Inc,supported by **Bill Gates** led Breakthrough Energy fund and MIT’s The Engine fund.

2 High Purity: 99.97% purity lithium carbonate samples never previously delivered at scale in a cost competitive manner for a premium price(refer ASX announcement 9 January2020 and 20 October 2020)

3 Sustainable /ESG: Far smaller environmental footprint than conventional methods, that returns virtually all water (brine) to its source without changing its chemistry, avoiding “water politics”in arid environmentsfor a better outcome for local communities.

4 Prime Location, Large Projects: Flagship Kachi project in prime location among low cost producers with a large lease holding (70,000 ha) and expandable resource (4.4 Mt LCE) of which only 20% is used for 25 years production at 25,500tpa(JORC Resource: Indicated1.0Mt, Inferred 3.4Mt, refer ASX announcement 27 November 2018). Pre-feasibility study by tier 1 engineering firm shows large, long-life low-cost operation(refer ASX announcement 28April2020)

An innovativedirect extraction technique,based on a well-used ion exchange water treatment method, has been tested for over 18 months in partnership with Lilac Solutions, with a pilot plant module in California operating on Kachi brines and has shown 80-90% recoveries. Battery qualitylithium carbonate(99.97% purity)has been produced from Kachi brine samples with very low impurities (refer ASX announcement 20 October 2020). The first samples of high purity (99.97%purity) battery quality lithium carbonate is beingtestedin a NMC622 battery by Novonix. Hazen will produce further samples fordownstream supply chain participants and off-takers.

This method of producing high purity lithium can revolutionise and disrupt the battery materials supply industry as it’s scalable, low cost, and delivers a consistent product quality.

Hello investors, hope you all had great holidays!

It's been awhile since I last posted one due to a project at my full-time job. I've made it my new year's resolution to continue improving this forum to be more informative and helpful for everyone so please feel free to leave any feedbacks!

As we enter the new year, I believe it is important to keep things in a broader perspective. That means we need to keep a bigger picture of where we are now and where we are heading, per the Mosaic theory as I mentioned previously in #2 of this post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing\_philosophy\_plz\_read\_this/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

As Howard Marks states in his book "Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side", if we can understand where we are in the broader market cycle, we can position ourselves in better odds to win.

After all, our goal is to invest for the best risk/reward scenarios, whether it means buying stocks, purchase a house, shorting treasuries, or doing a combination of different things. As long as we take care of the downside, the upside will take care of itself.

That is why it is critical to understand what's going on around us right now.

Below are some headlines and graphs that will put things into perspective.

Corporate profits improving

📷

Negative correlation between debt amounts and corporate yield, either corporate yield has to go up (which means corporate spread widening, or a correction/recession) or the amount of debt has to come down. I believe that it is more likely that the corporate spread will go up as it is much likely for companies to face distress than for them to reduce the amount of leverage in a short period of time.

Please note this post about how I argued it's more likely for the corporate spread to widen than to narrow.

Rising amount of companies with covenant-lite loans. Higher amount of CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), which are similar to the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) seen in 2008. For now, it seems to me that they're bundling a bunch of cov-lite and distressed loans into tranches and selling them to raise money. Don't focus on this too much if you are not familiar with the security but keep this in mind for later.

Not surprisingly, energy, cyclicals, and transportations are all struggling compared to the strengths in the tech sector.

Higher leverage globally and in US

Stocks close record high

Based on the preceding information, it is pretty clear to see that we have the following list of observations.

1. More debt, including both IG and HY, are being issued across all sectors, all countries, and all types of institutions, even at the individual levels.
2. Corporate spreads are compressed, for that matter all rates including munis, ABS, CLOs, loans, and short-term rates (don't get hung up on any unfamiliar names or security types, as the point is that we are seeing both record amounts of leverage when the yields are at the lowest point. Normally, they go the opposite directions).
3. Risk assets (stocks, real estate, loans, bitcoin?) are trending up.
4. Economic conditions are improving as indicated by rising corporate profits.

This is all happening when COVID cases and deaths are surging to record highs and a lot of the countries have imposed restrictions.

If you were asked in April when the US was just going into a lockdown phase where we would be in late 2020, would you have guessed all of it? Specifically the point about surging COVID cases and deaths in conjunction with a record-high stock market and tight corporate spreads? Personally, I am amazed at all of these as they mostly defy the traditional econ 101 or finance 101 schools of thought. Remember all those PhD economists, market forecasters, and investors arguing for the worst stock market, crazy levels of inflation, and rising bond yields? They all got it wrong. How?

This leads me to the topic for today's post.

While the markets have surprised everyone, the list of observations isn't actually all that surprising considering the magnitude of the monetary and fiscal policies.

We have seen an unprecedented (probably the most used word in 2020) amount of actions from both the Fed and the gov't.

Source: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-11/56746-MBR.pdf

Just these two graphs show the extent of the stimulus provided to the country.

Most of you are probably familiar with the story up until this point, as they have been mentioned numerous times in news articles.

The next part is where I think it will get a bit interesting.

**My personal opinion on stocks is that we will see a broader market rally for the long term (2-5 years) with a few corrections in between.**

It is the Fed that usually causes a recession or a depression even.

📷

If you look closely, most, if not all, recessions were just after when the Fed raised rates. Obviously controlling the rates is not the only maneuver that the Fed pulled over the years but it does indicate the Fed's willingness to turn hawkish (raising rates and tightening monetary policy).

Remember 2018 Christmas market meltdown? That was also caused by the Fed being too hawkish than the market could handle. JPowell immediately changed his stance based on the market reaction and turned dovish instead.

But why would Fed try to kill the economy with tighter monetary policy? It's because of the fear of inflation. Inflation can get out of hand in no time and their role is to prevent that from happening.

The point I'm trying to make is that all we need to focus on at the moment is the Fed action and the government policy in order to see where the market is heading for the next 2-5 years. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that their policies are so significant and so powerful that they are almost single-handedly driving the economic recovery and the markets.

We don't need to worry about the Fed turning hawkish as the Fed has explicitly promised us we won't get any balance sheet contraction or rate hikes for the next 2-3 years until we have beaten the inflation target on average.

We also don't need to worry about the government reducing its deficit as they have also promised to spend for the country, and worry about the deficits later.

To summarize, we've got a few forces in action.

1. Favorable Fed and government policies -> Positive to the risk-assets
2. Signs of excess: EV bubble, bitcoin, risk assets rally, margin investing record highs, market sentiment at the highest, put to call volume ratio at the lowest, and so on. -> Negative to the risk-assets
3. Vaccine coming up -> Positive to the risk-assets

My personal feeling is that we will certainly see a few quick, out-of-nowhere corrections in the risk markets (stock markets) in the short-term due to the signs of excess I have observed. But the monetary and fiscal policies are too powerful to fight against.

Therefore, I have positioned myself for shares in stocks, as opposed to call options or bull spreads (as they are too short-term), short treasuries, long gold, long cleantech, and a good amount of cash (20-30% cash). I will be observing the markets from the sidelines for a bit and decide when to pounce.

As always, please feel free to share your ideas or opinions.

I hope everyone has a great New Year's Eve and look forward to a great 2021!

Anyone know of a way to do so?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2021 Resolutions for the happy investor The end of the year is near, 
why the fuck are you on reddit? Good that I am here to share with you the tips to make 2021 your best year ever.
If you don't have time be sure to comment or bookmark it for next year.

So without further ado here they are:

1. **Waste less time.** 
Got Netflix? Cancel it. Facebook? Delete it. Twitter? Get rid of it. Instagram? Stop it. Reddit? Skip it.
 Apart from the negative influence a lot of these media have, it's often a horrible waste of time.
 Americans spend on average [1471 hours] (https://www.mandatory.com/living/1478185-social-media-wasting-time) a year watching tv.
 Malcolm Gladwell stated that it takes [10.000 hours or practice to become an expert at something](). Didn't read the book, but I gave my own twist to it: I combine it with the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and I come to the conlusion that it takes only 80 hours to get 50% of the expert level. So yeah, let's be conservative and let's say it takes 100 hours to be decent at something.
 Then, go ahead, get decent at something instead of watching television. Learn to code. Learn a new language. Study nutrition. Try to master an instrument. Make your own furniture. *This is investing in yourself.*
 Waste less time on politics as well. The chance you will change something is very small anyway. Clean your own room first.

2. If the thing you picked up at #1 is not a physical activity, pick up one. Go lift, run, go play squash. It's healthy for both body and mind. Chop trees. Fix your garden. Not only does this make your body release nice hormones and improve your physique, it also decreases the chance of getting Alzheimer's later in life.* This is investing in yourself.*

3. **Waste less money.** Boosting your savings rate with [15% means you can stop working 8(!) years earlier](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). So again, cancel that Netflix membership and skip that McDonalds meal for a nice homecooked one. This is investing in yourself.

4. Allocate some money to 'high-risk' investments. Buy Bitcoin, smart people do. Buy [Coinbase before the IPO](https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S25039356). We are in a bullmarket and the FED is printing like crazy. Cash is trash.
You are scared of a loss? The dollar lost 10% ytd versus the euro.... and versus bitcoin? More than 70% loss.

5. Make someone's day more often. Call your mother.

Basically says I should dollar cost average into a variety of Etfs.

My question is how much should I put into nio? I have heard very good things about it, I.e. Many are hailing it as the next tesla. I had about 5000 in it but took out a couple thousand today, as it was on a high.

I am worried about putting too much of my eggs in one basket (I currently have 9k to play with), but at the same time, I have a fear of missing out on major gains if it actually becomes a legit car company.

Let me know your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2021 Investment Strategy Hey, over time I have changed my portfolio from a diversified dividend stock portfolio (12-14 stocks) now switched to an ultra concentrated high growth portfolio.
Everyone is different and need to decide which strategy suits their risk tolerance the best.
As a young investor my goal is to maximise growth, having an ultra concentrated strategy has by fair been the better for growth for me by far this year. Diversification leads to average returns, it seems in this crazy market anyway

I hold only TSLA 45%, TTCF 25%, AMD 15%, NIO 5%,
5% cash

However TSLA has grown so much, surely will need to take some profit eventually. AMD has been more stable but all growth stocks seems to be majorly overvalued.

The general consensus is bullish for 2021, low interest rates, more QE potentially as the fed said they’re continue to use all tools within their means. Is anyone worried about next year? Or which signs are you looking out for in the market in case there’s a crash?
Potential hike in interest rates could be the catalyst for a crash?

I think Coca-Cola is a great company with a huge moat and worth the investment. But I don’t drink soda.   McDonald’s is a successful international business I don’t see going under, but I haven’t eaten fast food since I took a high school nutrition class over 10 years ago.

Why not make a pact where we all commit to buy small perpetually?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have become a living meme to all my investor friends because I keep missing out on every good investment opportunity since I started while they became richer and richer. If you don't want to become a loser like me listen to your gut and don't be afraid to take risks. I got friends that made a fortune on Bitcoin and others on tech stocks like Tesla, Microsoft and Apple.
I remember countless conversations we had, them telling me to invest(I remember clearly that at that time I could have bought around 200 bitcoins) and I just couldn't be bothered "gambling" my savings so I had them parked in a bank for a lousy 1.5% interest per year for over 12 years.

Back on January of this year I finally got some courage and decided to invest but chose to put my savings on a diversified ETF portfolio instead of picking single stocks, because I wanted to limit my risk.
In February my portfolio went down around 35% due to the Covid market crash and I got immense pressure from my wife to sell and save as much of our savings as possible before we lose everything. I panicked and caved in, more than half the amount was hers so I couldn't really refuse.

During the following months and for some bizare reason the markets not only recovered from the February-March losses, but they kept making record highs and made many investors rich during a pandemic that killed milions and crippled most countries economies. Not even sure how this was possible if you ask me.

Moral of the story: 
Don't be a fucking loser like me. Don't be scared to take financial risks because you will never make money if you don't. All my investor friends started with a lot less capital than me and ended up rich or well off.

Goodbye 2020, hello 2021.

Hello all!

As the year comes to a close we've seen some crazy-ness in the markets and historical gains. Are we in a bubble? Or are we entering a new era of retail investors and YOLO traders that are pushing markets to all time highs?  Is this sort of thing sustainable if and when things get "back to normal"? 

Where do you people think we are on this chart? Just a post for discussion and debate._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [US] Tax advantage of setting up legal entities for stock trading/investing TLDR; Is there any tax advantage of setting up any legal entities (LLC/S-Corp etc) for stock investing/ trading activity?

For retail investors who have a different primary source of income and invest in the stock market (or even trade frequently but do not qualify as traders per IRS guidelines) to derive some secondary income, is there any tax advantage of setting up a separate legal entity for all trading activities?

I know that answer is probably “it depends on your exact scenario and your financial goals” but I’m curious to know under what common scenarios does it make sense?

For example: many retail investors I know have a full time job. They buy/sell stocks may be once or twice a month. They probably trade some options every now and then. Would it make sense for them to setup any legal entity to get any tax advantage on their side income from trading activities?

PS Happy New Year everyone!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VSMAX's holdings not actually small cap? VSMAX is one of vanguard's small cap index index funds, yet when I looked up their holdings, I found that their largest holdings are ZBRA, ETSY, TER, and HUBS.

Those 4 companies are approx $20B companies, which puts them into Large cap, not small.  Based on various google search sources, my definition of small is <$2B.

The VSMAX prospectus references the MSCI Small Cap 1750 index, which has similar large cap companies for its top holdings.

Maybe a case could be built for Etsy, seeing how most sales there are from tiny startups in people's garages, although I would generally classify those businesses as micro or nano caps.  Even if that's the reason, then couldn't the same logic apply to Amazon or eBay (which I don't think anyone would consider as small caps either)?

Also, even if that's the reason, that logic doesn't really work for Teradyne either though.

I rented the starter property out for $2100 a month. I'm currently paying 4.06% interest as a "first home" mortgage. I want to refinance the starter property because rates are so much lower now. 

The starter property has gone up in value and is now worth about $350k. I have approximately 30% equity.

Can you refinance a rental property as a "second home?" I've read that you can't do this, but there are sites saying you CAN if you have at least 25% equity and your income can cover both properties.

I make about 175k/year (wife lost job because of covid). Mortgage on McMansion is about $2700/month.

Are you forgetting that past performance can't predict future performance?

Did you go over each of the balance sheets and conference calls for the top 10 holdings in these ETFs and agree that they are undervalued?

Or are you just putting your faith in Cathie, who has no control over market sentiment towards these stocks?

Even if you actually believe in Cathie's ability to consistently outperform the market, and you believe in active fund management - why stop there? There are many active fund managers who performed even better than ARKK, with a better track record to boot! Is it just the ETF package that suddenly makes it a better investment?

I remember everybody ridiculed ARKK in this subreddit in consensus when someone asked about whether ARK ETFs are a good investment (before they exploded). Don't you think it's a little bit too late after the fact to call it a long-term set-and-forget investment?

He's done really well with VTI and VGT over the past few years. I've been telling him about ARKK, ARKG and a few other high flyers and he's interested in moving a small percentage of his portfolio to them. He enjoys watching the market, researching, and keeping track of it all.

Beyond holding the ETF so they are considered long term gains, are there any other tax consequences to consider if he puts a small percentage of his investments into these fund?

Many years ago before ETF's were as popular, I remember having to consider tax consequences of various mutual funds.

I'm doubtful that theses guys have taken the time to do a lot of DD on these companies (maybe they have?).

As such, the core of an investment portfolio should contain a passive index ETF that tracks the entire market, such as the MSCI World (or regional alternative). However, momentum indexes such as the MSCI World Momentum often do better or only *very slightly* worse than their baseline counterparts, including through the last two major financial collapses.

Why would one not build their portfolio around a momentum ETF, given the potential for greater returns at very little added risk?

Will upvote._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ARCT completely misunderstood I honestly can't believe how 1 person's opinion can trigger a 50% drop in this company.

The drop was for the following reasons:

\- Not moving fast enough

\- Not enough antibodies

\- THE BIGGEST REASON: May not be a 1 shot solution

The facts:

\- Not moving fast enough:

They are literally on the timeline that they outlined 4 months ago in their past video.

\- Not enough Antibodies

The antibodies after 1 shot of Pfe/ biontech was essentially equivalent to the antibody response in ARCT's first shot.

THE MAIN DIFFERENCE:

ARCT's vaccine in 1 shot provided ample antibodies, but also a strong Tcell response. Much better than any other vaccine EVER created.

\- May not be a 1 shot solution:

If you watch this video and actually understand what they're saying. This is ON TRACK to be a 1 shot solution. If ARCT was creating a vaccine like PFE they would not be valued like this. The reason they are valued at what they are is because of the type of mRNA vaccine they creat that is self replicatin and inducing a strong T cell response. Over time it is already, and will continue to show, that this response is effective after 1 shot over time.

Why T Cell is more important than antibody: [https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/)

Who cares;

If you seriously think that the couple of vaccines available now are ample for what the demand is you are strongly mistaken. Vaccine demand is for a surplus of vaccines. A multitude of vaccines are needed b/c not all vaccines work for everyone.

ARCT has the lowest dosage for a vaccine, single shot (yes, still works), cheaper, EASIER TO PRODUCT, EASIER TO STORE, EASIER TO TRANSPORT. *ARCT*\-021 will be lyophilized, or *freeze*\-dried, so it's can be stored at regular refridgirator temperatures.

Every other vaccine requires expensive equipment to keep it the right temperature at FREEZER LEVELS, not REFRIDGIRATOR. This is a huge difference number 1, number 2 the size of the equipment carrying the vaccine makes a huge difference.

PFE has a vaccine that requires 2 doses, stored at freezing temperatures. This is heavier, more expensive, and requires double the shipment / person.

And for everyone waiting for ARK's approval. They haven't sold, last time it dropped they waited 2 days before buying so you have 1 day left. After that ARK buy goes through you've missed the boat.

Ok, so in the movie the Big Short by Adam McKay (based on real events of the 2007 crash) the hedge fund managed by Doctor Berry creates a Short position on the whole Mortgage Backed Securities market by “borrowing” stock shares from the banks who do the sketchy securities (specifically the Credit Default Swaps i believe) for a certain price every year... which means that if they are not right in a few years he loses all of his money due to that interest... my question is why didn’t he just do a whole bunch of long term Option Puts? Wouldn’t that be better because he could have less at risk with just the premium And not worry about losing all of his money from holding a Short Position? Or is there some special rule about Hedge funds that I don’t know that doesn’t allow him to have such large amounts of money in options?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Precious Metals ETF vs Gold ETF Hello;

We donated old clothes and toys to the vfw organization earlier this year. It's was about 8-10 boxes of clothes and toys. They gave a sheet of paper with spaces for the value of donated items that we can use for tax purposes. 

Is there a default value that goes on here? How do you ensure its not an unrealistic number? Is there a depreciation formula for clothes and toys? It's our first time doing this - we keep forgetting to include this in our taxes every year.

They have pre-built ETF Portfolios with a minimum $2.5k to start. There are several portfolios to choose from based on how much risk is involved (60/40 etc).

What makes me wonder is they list “10% cash” as a component on all of those portfolios, regardless of risk. 

Is it a strategy to leave cash in such an account? Why not invest all of it from the get go? 

Granted, depending on how much the underlying securities are worth at the account inception that initial $2.5k is not going to be fully used up simply because stocks vary in price. There's going to be a little bit of cash left over after that first batch of securities are purchased. 

So is E\*Trade basically saying that “10% cash” is going to be just leftover cash once the portfolio is created? 

Or am I missing something?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling loss-making stocks for taxes in 2021 Hi all,

I am trying to evaluate few Canadian telecommunication companies from the investment perspective. I am reading that one of the indicators that is advisable to evaluate is [Cash Conversion Cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/cashconversioncycle.asp) (CCC). One of the factors for the calculation of this indicator is COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), however no companies that I am evaluating (Telus, Rogers) list this in their Income Statements.

Buying in at $60 or less is a deal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My thoughts and Due Diligence on ABCL **Disclaimer:** This is my opinion – I would appreciate any feedback or comments so I can improve my due diligence in the future.

**TLDR**: I want to buy ABCL, but in my opinion ABCL is currently overvalued. I had 3 red flags.

1. A competitor (CERT) has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap
2. ABCL has a high valuation with a small amount of revenue
3. ABCL have less customers than Palantir and C3.ai (competitors) and make less money on average per partner

ABCL has a lot of future potential. I wouldn’t buy position until May 2021 when the lock-up periods expire unless the price goes below $30 / share (which would put it at about an $8B valuation) before then to at least get some skin in the game. 

While the company’s financial performance is good, it’s current market cap given it’s revenue when compared to it’s competitors does not justify the current retail share price. 

Bearish short-term, bullish long term.

&#x200B;

**Part 1 -** **Company Description**

*“AbCellera Biologics Inc. \[ABCL\] develops antibody discovery platform.* ***Its full-stack, AI-powered drug discovery platform*** *searches and analyzes the database of natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed as drugs.”* 

According to ABCL in their S-1 form, *“Over the last eight years, we have developed and assembled technologies that unlock the database of natural antibodies.* ***We are democratizing the industry by providing our partners of all sizes with access to our centralized operating system****.”* So essentially, they have this huge antibody database and an analytics platform to help get from point A to point B for their partners. 

ABCL makes money through partnership agreements with industry leaders who they help solve problems. Partnership agreements can result in revenue in 3 ways:

1. payments for technology access and performance of research
2. downstream payments in the form of clinical and commercial milestones and 
3. royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics

Arguably the biggest biotech / pharmaceutical partnership that has been disclosed is that with Eli Lilly and Company to co-develop their COVID-19 vacine. ABCL has partnerships with a handful of companies in the biotech / pharma industry (some of which are left undisclosed on the S-1).

ABCL also receives grants and non-profit funding. Some of these organizations are the Government of Canada ($175.6M over multiple years) , DARPA ($30.6M over 4 years) the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($4.8M over 2 years). 

&#x200B;

**Part 2 - Company Performance**

Liquidity is **improving.**

* Working capital is about $93.9M as of Sept. 30, 2020 according to the filed S-1 form. This is substantially better than the $4.8M reported on Dec. 31, 2019.
* Current ratio is 5.7 per September 30, 2020 data in S-1 form
* Receivable Turnovers improved over 2019 levels (even when 2020 grant money and milestone payments are removed from revenue to be conservative), but it is important to note that it is still at about it’s 2018 level.

Solvency is **improving.**

* Free cashflow has improved significantly
* Debt to total asset ratio was deteriorating between 2019 and the September 30th, 2020 reporting period. Accounts payable and deferred revenue grew but current portion of long-term debt was significantly reduced. I would expect this to improve with the cash raised from the IPO. 
* Times interest earned ratio  has improved over the 2019 reporting period but is still below 2018 levels . The improvement is largely seen from the reduction in interest expense that were carried from 2018 to 2019 and the increase in revenue for 2020.

Profitability is **improving**

* Revenue has grown this year. ABCL’s profit margin is improving. ABCL is currently growth oriented so I wouldn’t hold my breath on them becoming profitable soon.
* Basic EPS from S-1 form shows improvement for this year (so far) over 2019 and 2018.

So the company is performing well and has a great product, but why has the stock been dropping since IPO day?

&#x200B;

**Part 3 - Market Position**

This is where things get interesting. It’s hard to find a strictly apples-to-apples comparison for ABCL. They are in the biotech field but are more of a data science company (keeping in mind they sell their services and access to their AI-powered drug discovery platform). 

**Predictive versus Prescriptive Analytics** 

One company that performs a similar service to ABCL is Certara (CERT). CERT provides customers with simulation of virtual drug trials with virtual patients to predict how drugs behave in different people. Reading the 2 company descriptions, we can see a slight difference with their platforms. CERT appears to use a predictive analytics approach where ABCL uses a prescriptive analytics approach. 

CERT also rely on a larger customer bases where as ABCL has a small and arguably more focused client base. While both are providing a similar service, CERT has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap (**red flag #1**).

Having said all of the above, to dive deeper we need to compare ABCL against other prescriptive analytic companies. I’ve picked 2: Palantir (PLTR) and C3.ai (ticker is AI, but I’ll continue referring to them as C3.ai to avoid confusion). 

**ABCL, PLTR and C3.AI Revenue Per Customer**

At the time of writing this, here are some of the relevant metrics for ABCL, PLTR and C3.ai:

**Prices: (USD/share)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|34.97|34.97|25.30|145.32|

**Market Cap (Billion USD)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10.243|5.349|47.502|13.928|

**TTM Revenue (Thousands USD)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|29,449|232,746|999,940|164,725|

How does ABCL have such a high valuation with such a small amount of revenue (**red flag #2**)?  It seems strange that ABCL could be valued at about 20% of PLTR (or roughly the same value as C3.ai) when it only makes a fraction of the revenue. 

**Maybe it’s related to the number of partners they have (or at least have publicly disclosed)?**

While we can’t know exactly how many customers each company has, we can try to guess at the revenue per partnership (or at least by looking at the largest ones they’ve disclosed) – it’s a very rough estimate but we’re just trying to figure out orders of magnitude here. 

PLTR in their S-1 form disclosed that their platform is used by 125 customers. For their TTM revenue, that works out to about $8M per partner. 

Using the same idea for C3.ai who has publicly advertised 26 partnerships, their revenue is about $6.3M per partner.

ABCL has 26 customers, but with such low revenue, they only make about $1.1M per partner. So, **ABCL have less customers than PLTR and C3.ai, and make less money on average per partner (red flag #3).** Again, this is just to approximate about how much they’re making per partnership. It’s not an exact number but it gives us an idea if the price is out to lunch or not (which I think it is).

**So why is the share price so high then?**

I think this is a case of supply and demand. The IPO was hyped up and there’s still less than 30% float. Lock-up period per S-1 form is 180 days, so don’t expect any big insiders to sell anytime soon.

The $17.50 price tag wasn’t for us, just Peter Thiel and the bunch.

**Peter Thiel you say?**

Yes, Peter Thiel. The same one at PLTR. Peter Thiel had a position of about 8.5M shares before the IPO and picked up another 3M on IPO day. He also sits on the Board of Directors for ABCL (since October 2020). 

In the S-1 form, ABCL outlined their desire for growth. They have new facilities under development and are scheduled to take occupancy in 2021. **From September 2019 to September 2020, ABCL has grew their workforce by 82%, moving from 98 to 174 full time employees**. Since September 30, 2020 there have been 50 different job postings advertised on ABCL’s website. They are looking at some serious growth. 

What really gets my excited about Peter Thiel on the Board of Directors is that there are a lot of similarities to how ABCL forms it’s partnerships for access to it’s platform to PLTR. Who do you call when you have a problem that you can’t solve but have lots of data? There really is not a better person to have on the Board of Directors for ABCL, especially after having such a big influx of cash to get to the next level as a company. 

&#x200B;

**Part 4 - Final Thoughts**

I think there's a lot to be exited about with ABCL. It's a young and innovative company. With it's low revenue levels and high stock price, it's hard to justify picking up stock at it's current valuation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UAL 21 Jan 22 90 Calls Hey Guys,

I picked up some UAL calls at the peak a few weeks back and am curious if I should take the L or hold steady. I paid a premium for these boys at 3.40 and the current value is 1.97. This is way under my stop loss point, and it seems uncertain if the stock will rebound enough to turn this into a profitable trade. Sure there's time on my side, but the stocks already slipped 10% and I'm down 40% on my position.
