 Why I’m bullish on CuriosityStream (CURI) CuriosityStream (CURI) is a streaming provider of fact-based entertainment content (including television shows, documentaries, and short clips). It is run by the founder of Discovery and was recently taken public. The material is reminiscent of when Discovery hosted quality content in the 90s / early 2000s.

Their streaming product does not include any external media and thus they are not subject to the high costs of acquiring licenses for additional content.

CURI has partnered with Amazon Prime and Apple TV to add CURi as a paid channel, seamlessly attracting millions of new viewers.

They have shown YoY revenue growth of 90%, and although advertising spend seems high recently I expect this to continue to grow. While Disney+ is great for children, parents are going to want more educational content.

At the end of 2020, CURI had over 13M users. With a price point of only $12/yr., I don't see this slowing down anytime soon as they continue to get their name out to the public.

I recently opened a small position in CURI last week at $17 and plan to continue adding on the dips.

Not a lot of traction on /r/stocks so hope the folks here find this interesting._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TTCF as a investment for your portfolio The Tattooed Chef is a plant based company that sells frozen foods in retailers like Costco, Walmart and Sams club. The US frozen food market is worth about 55 billion and the Tattoed Chef is trying to disrupt the market with quality foods that are plant based. A big part of this change is coming through the Millennial generation and Genration Z . The average millennial and Gen Z cannot cook, so what do they do take out and frozen foods. But with more of a focus on vegan and plant based foods. This is where the Tattooed Chef comes out to shine. The average man spends 290 $ at the grocery store and for women it is 323 $. How large is the Millennial and Z generation in a America you ask? 133 million Americans large and if they spend per say 20 dollars each for frozen foods that are plant based based. That is around 2,6 billion usd of revenue for the TTCF.

What does the Tattooed Chef have that the Very Good Food Company and Beyond Meat BYND doesn't ? The ability to have innovative products with a potential of 62 SKUs in 2021 and they are targeting around 200 SKUs. They are vertically integrated meaning that they own all forms of manufacturing and idea sharing. They can go from idea in to market in 3 days. They have all types of frozen foods in their products such as Single Serve Bowls, Smoothie Bowls , Vegetable Blends , Meat alternatives and Plant powered Pizzas. They have also launched a European commerce site as it will draw in new customers fromm all over the US.

They currently have 200k space of manufacturing room. They doubled in 2020 and will double in 2021 in manufacturing room. They are ramping up production as they are on target to reach 62 different SKUs. They have a plant in Italy and a plant in California the Italy plant will especially be good for European expansion in 2024. Their Certifications are on another level they have all of the organic seals of approval from the USDA.

Their Revenue increased 87% year o year from 2019 to 2020. It went from 58.1 Mil to 108.9 Million in 2020. Their gross profit also increased 70% from 9.9 Million to 16.8 Million in 2020. The adjusted EBITDA went up from 4.7% with a percentage of sales of 8.1%. It went up to 10.6% of total sales of 9.7%. They have not launched their Ad council yet but it should again help with total sales. Their predicted revenue of 2021 is 222 million which is almost a 100 percent raise of revenue. In 2022 their revenue should be 300 million with a Gross margin of 25 - 30 %. In 2023 it should be 500 million of revenue with as total margin of 30 to 35 %. In 2026 is the killer year with a predicted revenue of 1 billion with total margins of 35% plus. The adjusted EBITDA should be 20 % as of 2026 and in 2021 it should be in the main teens.

As of Q3 of 2020 their total assets were 66,718 million with 56,550 million of total liabilities.They recently exercised a warrant for 230 million worth of cash and it puts them at 296,718 million usd.

One of the most important thing about Tiscali is the fiber and the 5G technologies. Thanks to an early development of FTTH technology, and being Tiscali the first company to have adopted and pushed for this technology, today Tiscali's strategic position in the Italian market is fundamental, thanks also to its partnerships with OpenFiber and FiberCop who will be in charge of building all the FTTH infrastructure in Italy, abandoning the now obsolete FTTC and ADSL technology which was instead pushed by the competitor TIM (Telecom Italia).  
As for 5G, Tiscali, like other operators, has made an appeal that will have the verdict in March, to have new frequencies and fair competition that allows it to obtain concrete results also from this point of view, aiming to acquire new customers also smartphone side.

I typically have done short term trading (though not enough for trader tax status) but I'm going to create a more balanced long term portfolio that I'll rebalance based on thresholds.  I suppose it makes sense to keep some of every asset class in the IRA so I have something to sell tax free to rebalance.  i was also wondering if it would make sense to get my fixed income exposure in treasuries as futures in my IRA.  I suppose it definitely makes sense to keep futures trading in the IRA assuming I stay profitable of course. Can you guys comment on these ideas and clue me in to anything else I should be aware of?

Up vote_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ROCH: PureCycle the Overlooked Green Play DD **Summary** 

* Polypropylene (“PP”) plastic has a $98 billion global market spread across a wide range of industries and products of which <1% of that market is derived from recycled material.
* PureCycle is a technology leader in recycling PP, it possesses a patented and proven purification process that produces nearly virgin-quality resin from plastics. 
* Strong pushes from both consumers and regulatory bodies to move towards the use of recycled plastic make for a great opportunity in an untapped market. 
* Despite strong market demand, PureCycle is the only player in the game with both the technology and cost competitiveness to supply recycled PP. As a result, it has already been approached with overwhelming interest from corporations.
* To play their parts in the drive for “Going Green” many corporations are targeting high rates of recycled content in PP products for the future.  PureCycle’s global commercial partners to date include L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Total, and BMW, as well as several high-quality investors.
* There is a tremendous risk/reward opportunity at current prices, with revenue and EBITDA achieving hyper growth as plants come online with attractive economics, margins, and high ROIC. Assuming 30x EBITDA, TP YE’25 is $237 with shares trading at $19.00 today.

**The Play**

There is an increasingly big push from both environmentally-conscious consumers and governmental regulation to solve the building global plastic problem. As the Democrats assume power in Washington a push for environmental policy is expected, and single use plastic being banned in several states is just one example of the regulation to be expected for the future.  Most investors are focused on green energy and consumer technology, while waste management and recyclables go overlooked.  PureCycle is a revolutionary technology company focused on transforming waste PP into virgin-like resin. The same story that is driving enthusiasm for Enphase, Sunrun, and Tesla can be applied and seen for PureCycle Technologies. This is a massive global market for its taking, as no other companies or technologies can efficiently address PP recycling at scale. PureCycle holds the exclusive license to its patented solvent-based purification recycling technology, with the ability to commercialize it and bring recycled PP to market. With a disruptive technology, strong moat around the process, and tremendous demand given the consumer and regulatory environment, this creates an extremely exciting opportunity.

**The SPAC Deal**

PureCycle has struck a deal with ROTH CH Acquisition I that is expected to be finalized by the end of Q1 2021.  PureCycle is to be acquired by ROTH CH Acquisition I with $76.5 million in trust.  The deal is valuing the post-merger company at a $1.2 pro forma market capitalization and a $826 million Enterprise Value.  The Enterprise Value is from the 118.3 million shares of ROCH capital sold at $10 plus the $310 million in debt that PureCycle raised by selling municipal bonds and $60 million in convertible notes minus the $667 million in cash that PureCycle will receive from the selling the shares.  PureCycle plans on using the cash to finish Plant 1 and begin construction in Europe on Plant 2. 

**The Market**

PP is used across a wide range of industries, including consumer packaged goods, electronics, automotive, building and construction, and agriculture.  At the moment you see virgin PP in plastic containers, potato chip bags, razors, as well as food grade applications.  The recycled PP at the moment can only be used for dark plastic applications such as trash cans, rugs, and plastic furniture due to the greying color and unpleasant odors that still remain. 

The annual global demand of PP is roughly 173 billion pounds selling at approximately $0.57 a pound landing the total addressable market at \~$98 billion.  The PP market has grown at an average of 4% a year for the past 5 years and is expected to continue to climb at similar rates in the coming years.  As of 2020, due to polypropylene being extremely difficult to recycle, less than 1% (.8%) of all purchased PP is recycled.  The demand potential for high quality recyclable PP, technology moat, and large time and cost barrier to entry positions PureCycle in a very strong place to start to meet the demand and create a recycle loop that the market is desiring.  

An increasing number of companies are now setting sustainability mandates to act as a key differentiator. L’Oreal is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025, moving to 100% by 2030, while Procter & Gamble is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2030. In a $98bn market, broad sustainability goals targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025 represents a $49bn opportunity in the next five years. The demand side of this equation can be satisfied by PureCycle’s world-first recycling process, as it produces high quality resin without compromising appearance, purity or performance. PureCycle’s product quality has been tested and validated by Procter & Gamble, large contractual customers, and third-party engineering specialists. PureCycle is the only player able to capitalize on this tremendous demand opportunity and has already pre-sold 4x their existing capacity – all without a sales force. This technology can close the recycling loop for PP and be delivered in a cost-effective way.

**Proprietary Technology with Tremendous Pricing Upside**

PureCycle developed a physical separation process that utilizes a specialized solvent based purification process. All unit operations are well-known and commercially available at scales much larger than required by PureCycle and involves process operating conditions comparable to current polyolefin production conditions. This includes standard equipment like a Scheibel Extraction Column, a Decanter, Settler and Solid Extraction, candle filters, adsorption filters. This is important because it means the equipment is readily available and at the size that would be needed to scale the operations. The unique aspect here is what goes into the process, the filters/solvent used, temperature and pressure maintenance etc. This process also only consumes 1/7th the energy and is more cost efficient than producing virgin polypropylene. PureCycle can essentially recycle anything that has high PP content and create virgin quality resin. 

The attractive pricing upside is easily found in the market, with rates of virgin PP selling at \~$0.57 / lb and recycled PP costing between $1.00 to $2.00 / lb.  With regulation and consumer demand driving businesses to buy recycled PP and PureCycle having a much higher quality product produced at a lower cost to other recycled PP, it is safe to say there is a lot of pricing upside potential.  

**Unit Economi**

Plant 1, which is being built now in Ironton, OH, will be PureCycle’s least efficient plant with modeled price / lb of $0.90 and EBITDA / lb of $0.45. Plant 2 will be a more efficient plant with improved unit economics of $0.55 / lb. The forecasted business is to include 5 plant clusters, that are much more efficient, with 825m pounds a year in capacity.  The clusters give competitive advantage by leveraging the same infrastructure and reduced capex. 

PureCycle’s model was structured around a municipal bond that they raised, negotiated at 14 cents a pound for feedstock. However, owners of plastic waste are generally charged cost to get rid of it, which gives PureCycle a great opportunity to leverage the system to capture pricing at a much cheaper price point. 

The FCF and EBTIDA margin they are able to generate is extremely attractive at 58% and 56% even at the $1.00 price / lb. PureCycle’s growth strategy targets over $800 million in revenue with EBITDA margins in excess of 50% by 2024. 

The current business plan has PureCycle building \~ 1 billion in capacity over the coming 3-4 years and at $1 a pound results in $1b of revenue. At a 50% EBTIDA margin, PureCycle will do 500m in EBTIDA. All of this results in extremely attractive top line math, unit economics into margin profile, and return on invested capital. Additionally, the funding on these facilities can get 80% debt for the project level capex.  


**Competition?**

Other approaches to plastic recycling have existed in the market for decades, but they are limited in application, not cost competitive, and have failed to gain any meaningful traction as a result. Chemical recycling does not yield contaminant-free resin – limiting its potential food grade applications – and also has high energy costs. Mechanical recycling only works in limited use cases – not with any discolored feedstock, as the output becomes gray – and the product generally smells and looks unprofessional with melt flow index issues. PureCycle owns the only process that can take any feedstock and produce resin at a comparable virgin quality to virgin plastic -- usable for food-grade consumption.  PureCycle also has a solid margin profile, as they are able to produce the product at 1/7th the energy cost of virgin.

**The Bears Case**

Some investors are worried about the fact that Procter and Gamble are the true owners of the patents that created the technology and PureCycle is only leasing them. The concern is that for some reason P&G licensed out the technology to other players.  P&G decided to invest and develop the technology to solve a problem that they had with desiring to make their packaging from recyclable products.  They decided that they did not have the commercial ability to bring it to market and made more sense to find a 3rd party to scale the business and PureCycle was chosen.  The lead scientists and people from P&G are still working with PureCycle in more of a partnership than simply licensing the technology out.  P&G is still very heavily invested and desires to see the success and scaling of PureCycle for its own benefits and goals and has agreed to be on the line to personally protect the patents for PureCycle as part of the deal.  The current deal with PureCycle is an agreement to perpetuity, which should ease any hesitations by investors. No one else will be licensing this process/technology for the duration of the patents and Purecycle has developed a lot of their own patents as part of the commercialization efforts.

Another case against the buy is the fact that it is a SPAC deal between Roth and PureCycle and there is increased risk.  This is in fact true, but the reality is the deal has already been announced and is simply waiting for the SEC to sign off.  To date the SEC has not stopped an announced merger from closing for regulatory reasons and there is no reason to believe this deal should be any different.  Roth is excited about the partnership as they view the business as a slam dunk opportunity. 

**Guaranteed Revenue and LOI’s**

Major global commercial customers including L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Ravago and Total have already signed agreements committing to purchasing hundreds of millions of pounds a year.  These contracts have already guaranteed 4 years of maximum output from PureCycle’s Plant 1. Many other major retailers have written LOI’s and are potential to fund and drive the growth of other facilities and plants.  PureCycle has a deal with Nestle who has a goal and company commitment to seeing that 100% of its packaging is 100% recycled by 2025.  I believe that for investors, PureCycle having deals with blue chip companies for long durations significantly de-risks any danger to revenue projections.  

**Forecasting Valuation**

From a valuation perspective, by looking at the landscape, environmental services companies, waste managers of the world trade at \~10x – 18x EBITDA. This includes players like Advanced Disposal, Republic Services, Waste Management. The process technology players such as Albemarle, Amyris, Trex, Rogers Corporation get a larger premium, trading at a \~20x – 25x EBITDA. For the players with high growth, high margin potential and in ESG, the multiple starts to jump up quite significantly to \~30x+ EBITDA, companies such as Enphase, Solaredge, Array, Plug Power, Ballard Power etc. 

Although there are no direct comps to PureCycle as the technology is one of a kind, I looked at Danimer Scientific (DNMR) who also recently completed a SPAC deal.  Both companies have been formed from P&G developed patents to address the plastic problem that the environment faces.  Danimer did purchase the patents outright but have owned them for close to 10 years and are still working to get the business going.  Based on side-by-side comparisons of both companies self-projected business you can clearly see that PureCycle is trading at a significant discount. 

**Conclusion**

PureCycle, with high value add and a unique offering, high margins, high expected growth, a proprietary process, large addressable market, and ESG is trading at an extremely attractive price point at 3.8x EBITDA. There is significant potential for rapid multiple expansion as their development plan is successfully executed. 

This is a hyper growth story in revenue/EBITDA as plants come online with attractive economics. Financial projections show \~60% gross margin on the products and a \~30% ROIC for future plants at scale. The return profile here is extremely lucrative even with the pre-revenue valuation. Assuming 30x EBITDA, TP here is $237 by YE’25 with shares are trading at $19 today._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $POWW ammo company with uptrend potential.

Based on the price action of CCIV, the original Lucid investors could see how hot their brand is, maybe it really could be a major Tesla competitor, if not a killer.

The original CCIV market capitalization was 1.5B billion at $10 per share. Assuming the original Lucid investor think the company have a optimistic estimate of 30 billion dollars as initial market capitalization (you can try different numbers to come up with a different final market capitalization estimate), which means there will need to be a lot of PIPE investment at $10 dollars a share, even with the original share holder keeping a large percentage (say 70%) of the company.

In this scenario, at the conclusion of the merger, the CCIV share holder would hold about 5% of Lucid Motor.  With the CCIV current stock price, Lucid Motor market capitalization could reach about 100 Billion.

Ok, so Wells Fargo (WFC) was hit hard by the pandemic and unlike most other banks, WFC has underperformed in recent years. Not only did the pandemic hit them hard but fed regulations due to their fake accounts scandal really limited growth. They were primarily focused on commercial lending. Their investment banking was just a very small percentage of their operations. So when the pandemic hit, it hit WFC really hard. 

So the reasons I like WFC:

1. As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC. 
2. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal.
3. They are expanding their investment arm.
4. They have lots of money in reserve for buybacks which could see the stock price climb.
5. Also, they were one of the few big banks that cut their dividends. I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. 
6. They are cutting expenses.

Hello everyone, 1st time poster. Appreciate your thoughts on EYEN from your guy's experience. Currently heavily invested in this stock when I picked it up for about 2 bucks a share a while back. Holding for long term. Appreciate your guy's thoughts on how to financially think about these kinds of companies what to watch out for interns of losses before coming to market, acceptable debt loads, etc. 

**My Background:** 

I am a 6+ year researcher/physician and currently a emergency medicine doc who enjoys picking biomedical stocks by reading the actual scientific literature behind the companies. I have been personally published in some of the top journals in the country. Some biomedical companies I can tell right off the bat it is based on a "weak" premise or the upside of a new therapy is too small to change clinical practice. One company I have been following closely is EYEN, an ophthalmology company originally the brain child of a Harvard School of Medicine Professor.

Things I like about EYEN: 

**Micro-applicator Patent:** They hold great patents for a macrodosing applicator for ophthalmology drop applications. This is a huge deal as its first in the industry to offer such as patent. As a physician the ability to micro dose things like steroids to the eye for extremely common problems like glaucoma is fantastic. Currently we rely on dropper bottles that have a predisposition to cause systemic circulation of drugs you do not want systemically spread. Interestingly in the clinical trials they showed easy use of the applicator from 6 year olds all the way up to >80 year olds. 

**Repurposing Old Drugs + Micro-applicator:** this is the major reason I am very bullish on EYEN. They have shown success in repurposing old drugs for improving farsighted vision. These are old drugs that have been around forever. They essentially contract the muscles controlling pupillary constriction to improve vision. They're clinical trials are fantastic and very promising. The biological mechanism is sound and the drug is safe making it seem to me as a physician a no brainer. Millions could chuck out their contact lenses/ glasses for a micro dosed pharmaceutical option._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ While the next Bear Market be different? __Facts__

* There will be another significant market downturn.  It could be tomorrow or 10+ years ... but it will happen.
* Fed is committed to keeping rates low for next year or two.

__Question__: What happens if the next downturn occurs during the upcoming year(s) of low rates?

__Context__:  After almost every market down-turn since the 1980s, the Fed lowered rates ... see the link.  However, this time rates will be bound at 0 and the Fed will have little ability to stimulate (assuming fed doesn't go negative).  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRLTLT01USM156N

__My Thoughts (from America POV)__:
If a crash occurs during the low rate period, it could be the catalyst that breaks America's relative outperformance compared to the rest of the world.  The Fed's inability to stimulate and the current sky-high valuation could imply a decade of stagnant US equities.  I think that emerging markets would likely do very well in this environment.

I'm not saying that this will happen, just curious what the implication would be if it did happen.  I do think there's a chance we escape this fate.  For example, COVID shutdown end, euphoria, fiscal policy and savings propel massive customer spending, Fed increases rates to curb inflation and rates climb before the next crash.

__What do you think?__

*  If a crash happens during a low rate environment, what will the bear market look like?  Will it be different?
*  If the bear market is different during a low rate environment, what investment strategy do you think would succeed?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are Sportsbooks Gambling Companies Overvalued Now DAE think that all of these sportsbook companies are getting overvalued? Here are the numbers.

In mature markets like Pennsylvania, Indiana, and West Virginia, the per capital annual betting handle is $500-$600. Using that figure across the entire US, that would make the sports betting annual handle $200B, if sports betting was legal in every state. With a 6% average industry hold, that makes the potential annual revenue in this space $12B.

DraftKings - should have a 25% market share in sports gambling. That equates to annual revenue of $3B. If they have a 33% net margin on their business, that would equate to $1B EBITDA. Assuming their fantasy business is worth $4B, that means the sportsbook part of the business is being valued at 20x EBIDTA for a best case national gambling roll out, which is years and years away.

Penn National/Barstool Sports - should have a 10% market share in sports gambling. This equates to annual revenue of $1.2B. They will have a higher net margin because of Barstool, so let's say 45%, which equates to an EBITDA of $540M. Assuming their brick and mortar casino business is worth $5B, that means the sportsbook business is being valued at 28x EBIDTA for a best case national gambling roll out, which is years and years away.

Rise Interactive/BetRivers - should have a 7% market share in sports gambling. This equates to annual revenue of $840M. With an estimated net margin of 30%, that equates to an EBITDA of $250M, which means the company is being valued at 17x EBITDA for a best case national gambling roll out, which is years and years away._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $EVAX - Evaxion Biotech (new IPO, AI vaccines/cancer research) DD tl;dr: feels like this might go ballistic - lots of support and timing is right.

That’s it. Now do your own DD. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

My position: 50 @ 9.65_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sony -- value and tech (SNE) Just wanted to make a quick post about the Sony ADR.

It trades at a multiple of around 13-14, is a large cap, has brand recognition, and is likely to continue to be successful in all its endeavors. It is my biggest gainer percentage wise since last year, which I would not have predicted. Around 45% since I bought at 80 and it's not even a "meme stock."

13-14 p/e is quite low for a successful company, much less a tech stock. I have beaten down REITs trading at a higher p/ffo multiple. Its long term chart looks a little scary but it was a victim of the dot com/tech bust. At the current multiple it looks like one of the safer technology stocks to hold compared to megacaps trading at 40 or 200.

Revenue is expected to be over 80 billion as of March 2021, which is an increase over prior years. Profit margins are at 27% which is quite good. Yield is minimal but it has experienced a 5 year CAGR of 42%, so if dividend growth is your thing, Sony hits the spot. Video gaming is expected to grow for years, prices have increased, and the hobby is now very well established rather than fringe or simply for juveniles. Of course Sony works within other realms of consumer electronics so they're diverse enough, although Playstation is of course the main draw here. 

Even at these relative highs you might enjoy an entry point for a pretty strong company!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Automakers going all-in on EVs Busy week for the auto industry, especially legacy companies. With Ford announcing $29B investment in EV/AV and GM also announcing $27B investment in EV/AV and with a goal to exclusively offer EVs by 2035, old-timer automakers will try to go through complex EV strategic turnarounds in the next years. Challenge, especially in the next years, will be to transition their complex manufacturing process of ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles to EVs or efficiently manage two separate ones. Curious to see how investors/markets will value these companies going forward. The Tesla story and stock momentum phenomenon have changed how we value companies. And of course, there is a lot of hype on anything that's green; market seems to be rewarding innovation.

Side note: near-term sales outlook might be complicated because of chip shortages which is causing production delays.

This is not financial advice, and for the sake of experiment I am trying to keep this entire post *totally empty* of any form of opinion or explicit narrative about how I or anyone else should react to this information. 

You should be aware of the risk of errors in the data. You should be aware of the risks of an *implicit* narrative or bias for example in the choice of data or time points considered or the way the data is presented. This post is just a list of the information that I myself think about most often in relation to estimating the value of one particular company, and not a recommendation that you should use the same set of information or think about it in the same way. 

Shell / RDS 

1. Shell / RDS is an international oil & energy supermajor with similarities to companies like Exxon, Chevron, Total and BP. Shell generally derives profits from finding, extracting, processing and trading oil & gas and derived products of oil & gas and by providing related services. The market prices for oil & gas are an important factor affecting a) the level of profitability of the company in the short term and b) the share price in the longer term. e.g. https://www.shell.com/about-us/major-projects.html

2. The current prices of oil & gas are as follows. https://oilprice.com  (11:30 EST, 5th Feb 2021). You can also use yahoo finance tickers CL=F, BZ=F, NG=F. **WTI oil: $57.1 Brent oil: $59.6. Gas: $3.0**.

3. A recent year with very similar average prices over the year, compared to the market price levels today and over the last few weeks, is 2017. 2017 average industry prices: **WTI oil: $51. Brent oil: $54. Gas: $3.0**. Source: See table "Oil and gas average industry prices" at: https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2019/strategic-report/strategy-business-and-market-overview/market-overview.php

4. The share price of RDS B-shares at the end of that year, on 1st January 2018. **RDS-B: $71.93 USD**. https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDS-B?p=RDS-B&.tsrc=fin-srch

5. The share price today. **RDS-B: $35.21 USD**    (11:30 EST, 5th Feb 2021)

6. An incomplete list of other factors worth reading about:

- Energy demand is currently a bit down vs. past years, but is expected to return to ordinary levels by 2022. Data here: https://www.iea.org/topics/covid-19

- Interest rates are lower than other times in history. This affects the discounted value of the  stream of cashflow from assets and the cost of debt to companies. Data here: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate

- Extraction/processing costs are likely to be lower and / or  trending lower. https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-costs-exclusive-idUKKCN26C0GO

- The way that Shell uses cashflow has significantly changed, with a 66% reduction of the dividend, increase in debt repayment and perhaps a change to buybacks.

- Shell has recently announced significant accounting writedowns which re-evaluate the value of major assets in light of new projections of future oil & gas prices.

- Many other factors and risks can affect share prices and company profitability. For example, consider the Deepwater Horizon spill which affected BP's profitability for 10 years and still has an effect today.

- Investing in individual shares is generally more volatile / carries higher risk of total loss than investing in entire sectors or market indexes. 

- There is no reason to believe the oil & gas prices today or in recent weeks will be representative of the average price over the coming year(s). 

- Political actions may affect the global energy industry in unpredictable ways. Wars, laws, permits, regulation, taxes etc. 

- This is not advice. I do not recommend or suggest you take any action. These are just some interesting facts that I myself find helpful to think about.  

If anyone notes a factual error or opinion in any of the above, please let me know.

If anyone has other interesting industry/company facts (not opinions!) they want to add for consideration, please post them up below.

I hold a long position in Shell and it may bias the way I gather or present data. 

Lastly, I am not a finance professional, I am just a random ordinary person. You should think carefully about the people and places that you develop ideas / gather facts or information from._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Container Ship Boom: Update - Rates Surging Higher  **BUY: NMCI (Navios Containers) NMM (Navios Partners) DAC (Danaos Corp)**

I posted here on [Monday morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9unrf/containership_boom_ongoing/) on these stocks, but news is quickly improving even further, so it merits yet another update. Since last Friday, my top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 27%:

· DAC: +24%

· NMCI: +25%

· NMM: +27%

As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance NMCI trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. "Diam hands" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!

The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like NMCI (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.

This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing DAC has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and a guy I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...

I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.

**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector, but most specifically DAC, NMCI, and NMM. NMM will likely be acquiring NMCI via a merger at 0.39 ratio in the next few weeks.

**Questions/Pushback:**

1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon?

The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.

2) Is this like "tankers?" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks!?

Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.

3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon?

Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.

4) I like NMCI, but my understanding is NMM is buying them, how to choose?

In my \*personal opinion,\* the best thing is to buy whatever is cheaper. So I take NMM and multiply by 0.39 and buy the cheaper one. As I'm writing this, NMCI is much cheaper than NMM by about 3-5%. Why? I believe it's mostly because people can buy NMM and sell $17.50 or $20.00 (or higher) covered calls against it for a premium. NMCI doesn't have a liquid options market. This is a temporary spread and I believe it will close within 3-6 weeks when the merger is (likely) completed.

5) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!

I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips (DRYS) was one example of a horribly managed firm.

6) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market?

The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.

***Disclosure:*** I’m long nearly every name in the space- ATCO CPLP DAC MPCC (Oslo) NMCI NMM ZIM. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. "Diam hands" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I just sold CMRE this morning and rolled it into ZIM).

I have about 10% of my wealth in $NMCI/$NMM. Average basis in NMCI is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.

I'm about 10K into ETFs (IWM, SPY, DVY) and starting to become very sensitive to the idea of a market crash (childish, I know). I have no plans to pull out (very childish), but I want to be on top of any and all scenarios where there is a massive buying opportunity. I've decided to hold an additional 15% worth my portolio in cash. This cash strictly for investing, not personal. The hope really, is that I never deploy that capital and the rest of my account keeps going up. 

How does everyone else deal with bears, buying opportunities and cash?

Note: Almost all investment forums suggest investing 100% of your portfolio into equities unless you're getting near your retirement/exit.

EDIT: **Take Aways from the Comments**

1. Take some profits out of high returning ETFs (i’ll do about 10% of my gains) and leave them in cash for a good buying opportunity.

2: Open a margin account with your broker so you can do a quick cash injection if there is a good buying opportunity. (Assess comfort level)

3. Selling covered puts (Sounds like an amazing option but ill need to do a little more research)

Thanks all!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upcoming IPOs Roblox and Coinbase. I'm **very** interested in the Roblox IPO but it seems their plans to launch Direct Listing has halted because of SEC scrutiny on how their income works.

Am I correct in assuming there has been no word on a planned date as of yet? 

Also, it seems they were valued at something crazy like 30 billion. That was surprising and a little deflating as $45ish a share is pretty pocket heavy for a poor schlub like me. However I see great potential as this platform has continued to increase it's user base every year. My daughter plays it frequently and she loves it and I'm a gamer myself although I don't play Roblox. I can see this IPO being increasing a lot, but I fear the valuation is way too high to see any meaningful increase in a year or two. Does anyone have any opinions on Roblox?

I'd  like to talk about the Telos Corporation, ticker TLS. It IPO'd back in  November and I'm curious about what others think of it as a long term  play.

# Basics:

Telos  is a cybersecurity company focused almost entirely in the government  technology sector. They've been around for decades, but only just went  public in the last year. At the time of this writing, they are trading  at a P/E of 148.48 and EPS of -$0.1229. They currently hover around a  $2B market cap.

Some of their clients include the FBI, State Department, FedEx, Raytheon, Verizon, and Citi.

Some of their partners include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Palo Alto networks.

# Products/Services:

Like  I said earlier, Telos operates in the cybersecurity space. Their  largest/most popular product seems to be their "Xacta" platform, which  is an automated tool to check an organization's compliance to national  cybersecurity standards. Additionally, Xacta works as a continuous risk  assessment suite that can detect and remediate gaps within an  organization's security infrastructure.

In additon to Xacta, they offer Telos Ghost. According to their website, Ghost is

>a  robust, scalable, secure communications network-as-a-service that  privatizes the public internet to hide network resources and masks the  identity  and location of personnel to ensure total protection as they  conduct their operations. These same capabilities can also hide servers,  applications, and  unified mobile communications to ensure completely  private voice, text,  video, and chat over any device.

Telos also offers myriad services from consulting to pen testing.

# Financials:

I'll  be up front, I am horrible with understanding financials of a company.  I'll just report here what I see on the Schwab research page for TLS.

For  the fourth quarter 2020, analysts estimate TLS will generate revenues  of $44.5M, a decrease of 4.31% over the prior year fourth quarter  results. Their annualized growth rate over the last four years is 4.5%.  In terms of debt, it looks like they are solidly in the red and have  been for some time with total equity decreasing from -$125M in 2015 to  -$141M in 2019.

93.7% of last year’s sales came from U.S. federal government contracts.

Leadership

Telos  is lead by CEO and Board Chairman John Wood. It looks like he's been  with the company for almost 30 years, and been CEO since 1994. It seems  that much of the management for Telos has been with the company for  quite some time.

Interestingly, Keith Alexander (former 4-star general and director of the NSA) was added to the advisory board last May.

# Personal Opinion

I  was lucky enough to get in on Telos at below $20 and have enjoyed the  massive runup in the last couple of months. I'm not sure how much steam  it has left in it, but I do consider it to have some growth left. After  the SolarWinds disaster, the government will likely increase its posture  in terms of cybersecurity and Telos seems poised to answer the call.  Additionally, with former government officials advising the board, it  seems likely that connections exist to get Telos into the hands of the  government organizations that need it most. The biggest turn offs for me  are its large debt and the fact that the company has been around  forever and only recently went public. This was probably just a means to  raise funds. I might take profits soon and let the rest ride.

I  am not a financial advisor or analyst and really have no idea what I'm  doing. Invest at your own risk and always do your own due diligence.

I'm curious to hear anybody else's thoughts.

I have been looking at companies that focus on women's health. I believe that they can have a big year, or multiple years, under Joe Biden's presidency. I came across DARE the other day and would like to hear what you have to say.

**DARE**

February 6th, 2020, DARE Bioscience was announced as the leader in women's health innovation. Having successfully accomplished positive topline results from DARE-BVFREE, a Phase 3 Trial of DARE-BV1 in Patients Diagnosed with genital bacterias. Currently, Dare is waiting for approval from the FDA for their primary drug, which is looking positive.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Simplify ETF (SPD) - S&P exposure with downside protection I personally really like their idea here - the ETF invests 98% into the S&P500, then invests 2% each year into SPX put options (they continually invest put options that are way out of the money, expiring in the next year).  This reduces the annual return each year by 2% when compared to the S&P - but can provide a great deal of protection when the market drops.  

They have back-tested their model against 08/09 and also the drop in early 2020, and claim that losses during these periods would have been reduced by over 50% (i.e. if the S&P was down 50%, SPD would only be down 25%).  Not actual numbers, just ballpark for illustrative purposes. 

I personally think there is a high likelihood of a 30% drop sometime in the next 3-5 years.  Even if SPD doesn't provide as much downside protection as they claim, I think its a good move for someone looking for general S&P exposure but with reduced risk for large drops.  Thoughts?

Hey Everyone. Hope you're all having a great day :)

I just wanted to get some thoughts on Walmart,  their share price has been up and down (mainly down since mid December) given everything that is going on; the lawsuit about the potential role in the opioid crisis, the tweet about Josh Hawley, 

However more recently, Walmart sold a majority share in ASDA (UK supermarket & retailer) for $6.8bn. Walmart are also awaiting the delivery of COVID vaccines as well as some other US pharmacies and retailers. Due to this, I have a suspicion that their share price will recover to what it was before the shenanigans of December last year, and then continue to grow.

Let me know your thoughts, I'm still learning and growing as a trader and investor so please feel free to critique my short DD here.

Cheers,

Henry

There is conflicting information on their website, as one commenter pointed out, it says a range between 3-3.5%. 

&#x200B;

It's actually only the spread on foreign currency, which changes every day and it depends on how much you're converting. For example, its about 1% for $30,000-44,000. On top of this, the $9.99 commission is charged in the currency of the equity you are purchasing (e.g. $10 USD for buying a US security).

Solution:

This part is based on TD Web Broker, but should work for other banks. Good new is, you can get around this by transferring you funds to a US RSP or TFSA account, which won't trigger penalties, as they are more or less than same account, only separated in your brokerage web page for visual clarity. You have two options for transfer: either go to Accounts and select 'Cash Transfers and Foreign Exchange' if its sitting in cash or 'Securities Transfer' if you have it tied up in US stocks. You can also call their Web Broker line, like I did, if the button isn't working. TD said it would take one business day for RSP and two days for TFSA to transfer. If you call and have them do it 'back of house, (e.g. calling) you need to remove any pending orders, possibly also stop losses, or they may not start the transfer, as they will wait until orders are settled. In which case, it may be safer just to sell and transfer when you have the cash.

&#x200B;

Once it's in the proper account (US TFSA) you will no longer be penalized for currency conversion, until you take the money out in CAD or purchase CAD stocks (or any non-USD listed security). Only cost should be the $9.99 US commission on each trade, which is lowered after you hit a higher threshold of trades, per quarter.

&#x200B;

Hope that helps.

What are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Semiconductor shortage in auto industry - investing opps in semiconductor companies Big news lately in this space. I work in corporate for a major automaker and it has been big news during our global town halls. 

It seems like the semiconductor companies are focused more on other industries, like gaming, phones, etc. rather than the auto companies, which is why there's a shortage in this area. I've been trying to find which semiconductor companies are leading for the automotive sector. Are there any that you guys might have your eye on, which could ramp up production in the auto sector or sell for a higher price point to automakers due to the shortage?

Competition is fierce but investors are eager to invest early in the future unicorn. In 2020, just over 100 biotech IPOs were recorded, nearly double form 2019 and raising nearly nearly US$20 billion! Most of these will stumble over technological limitations and FDA approvals (or lack thereof), and others will simply fail, but some will become multibillion revenue machines. 

The ability of assessing the true investment potential of biotech companies increasingly requires specific technical knowledge. This can represent a serious limitation when valuating any of those companies, especially for smaller investments who do not have an army of expert consultants they can rely on. 

How do you assess the value of such companies? What are your key metrics that will convince or deter you from investing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Magnachip MX Expected to Beat Q4 Guidance: Undervalued at 7x EV/EVITDA & Supplies to 5G OLED Phones / Margin Upside  After a 40% rally - Magnachip is now 7x EV/ EBITDA and still extremely cheap for this fast growing semiconductor company focused on 5G and OLED smartphones.

Magnachip Semiconductor NYSE:MX - 33% global market share in OLED display drivers or DDICs (allows OLED screens to function), behind Samsung which is #1 (66% mkt share)

* Cash on balance sheet $540MM as of Sep 2020
* Mkt cap of $650MM and debt of $308MM

**OLED is Booming**

MX is the largest independent supplier of OLED DDICs which power the display screens, and focused on high frame rate phones. It’s tied to the hip of Samsung and LG and a big winner in the OLED space especially with 5G and will most likely beat their Q4 guidance. OLED and chip manufacturers are fully sold out as per guidance from several semiconductor companies.

For each phone with OLED, there is 1 DDIC. For a rollable or foldable OLED screen, there are more than 1 DDIC chip on average. MX is also getting into laptop, TV, and auto OLED screens which all use more than 1 chip (given larger size).

**Q4 2020 Guidance Beat**

Magnachip Semiconductor Q4 '20 revenue/profits are likely to surprise, here’s why: in their most recent analyst presentation, they said their Q4 guidance put out in Q3 was based on LOWER manufacturing capacity from their foundry partners. That allocation went up.

From the analyst call: "Our Q4 revenue guidance range was based on allocation from foundry partners for OLED as well as internal Fab 3 ramp-up. We were able to secure greater supply than we originally expected."

In addition, there is likely strong forward guidance given improved margins below...

**Supply Crunch and Potential Acquirer?**

Synaptics, a $3.7bln market cap company that dominates the adjacent semiconductor touch chips for OLED screens (called TDDI, used in all AAPL phones) in their earnings call on Feb 4 said there is a supply crunch in OLED DDICs and a potential for "a tactical opportunity":

"Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed..\[On\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity."

Synaptics acquired an OLED DDIC company in the past (8-9 years ago) and did not make much out of it, focusing on the touch aspect versus the IC chip. However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for MX.

**Conclusion**

For a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -> drastically undervalued at \~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...

Recommendation: Shares are more attractive given the options are somewhat thinly traded._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Great News for Exxon Mobil Investors The activists are still at it and the financial press is reporting what the activists want them to report. See this article: [*Wall Street turns positive on Exxon after a brutal year. But some experts warn it could get much worse*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/exxon-mobil-wall-street-positive-on-oil-giant-but-analysts-warn-of-long-term-risks.html). These "experts" are all environmentalists with a political axe to grind! These sentiments may continue to depress the value of the stock for a longer period of time, giving investors more time to accelerate the compounding machine by reinvesting dividends. 

Before continuing, I encourage you to read [this](https://www.joshuakennon.com/lets-talk-about-investing-in-oil-stocks-and-the-oil-majors/) explainer about investing in the oil majors. The key point to understand is that oil investors are "paid to absorb volatility over multi-year periods". This is not a stock you buy with a 5 year time horizon, you're buying this for the next 25 to 50 years. We're in the middle of a painful downturn. **Now** is the time to be buying large blocks of Big Oil and to be reinvesting those dividends back into the firms. A book worth reading that can help you to understand this better is [*The Future for Investors: Why the Tried and the True Triumph Over the Bold and the New* by Jeremy Siegel](https://www.amazon.com/Future-Investors-Tried-True-Triumph/dp/140008198X). Companies that pay high dividends and whose stock prices are depressed for political reasons (like, for instance, tobacco over the past 50 years or Big Oil today) have historically had better returns than the hot technology companies whose future success was already priced in. Dr. Siegel also recommends looking for companies with low capital expenditures (that's not oil) and wide moats, consumer staples in particular are good investments. Think Coca Cola and Nestle. It's seriously a great book to read and to keep on your bookshelf for future reference. 

See Exxon Mobil's [2040 Outlook](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-innovation/Outlook-for-Energy/Outlook-for-Energy-A-perspective-to-2040) for a more sober look at the future of XOM and the energy industry in general. The 58 page PDF document that you can find on that page goes through expected trends in energy. They expect sharp increases in purchasing power out emerging economies, especially in Asia and especially in China. They also expect oil and natural gas demand to continue to increase. In a lower carbon economy nuclear is the best large scale source of energy but that's a hard sell. The next best thing is natural gas. 

Where are we right now? China is [still](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coal/chinas-new-coal-power-plant-capacity-in-2020-more-than-three-times-rest-of-worlds-study-idUSKBN2A308U) bringing more coal power plants online. Expect that to change over the years. They are already trying to [shift](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/natural-gas-prices-in-asia-may-have-peaked-after-recent-highs-eurasia.html) to a large degree to natural gas, as will the western world. We'll simply have no choice. 

Again, I encourage you all to carefully examine XOM's 2040 Energy Outlook. There's too much in there for me to just copy and paste it into a post. Exxon knows the energy industry inside and out. This document is comprehensive. Even if they're off by a large degree, natural gas and oil will *still* be in high demand. You can expect Western governments to continue to restrict production of fossil fuels, OPEC members whose economies are so highly dependent on energy will need high enough energy prices to continue for a while, and Russia will also need high energy prices. Expect China to increase production in the South China Sea and wherever else they can, but not too much that the price is kept down too much. They'll need it for their own consumption anyways over the coming decades.

I currently own 2,475 shares of XOM, split between different tax-advantaged accounts, all purchased in 2020 and mostly at a cost basis of under $35/share. I will continue to reinvest dividends of XOM at least as long as the yield is over 6% and likely until it's under 5%. My current focus is on accumulating shares of Altria and Philip Morris, but I expect XOM to be among the firms that will get some of my new cash this year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airlines stock post covid Hello,

I was up about 40% for the year of 2019, it was awesome, it was the first full year of working as an engineer and I have put in a bit of money into my investments. It felt REALLY good to see the growth it has done. Theeeeeen came the covid drop. I sold halfway down the drop, my entire brokerage portfolio and Roth IRA for about a 50% gains loss of my ENTIRE time investing. I did this because I believed that it will drop even more, which it did for a some days, but then it went back up, and back up, and back up, and kept going back up. I kept telling myself that it was a dead cat bounce and the market will drop even further than before and it never did. I tried to time the market and got rekt. I didnt even get back into investing late last year so I lost out on a good bit of money if I had just kept everything in.

**Lesson:** Timing the market is hard. It is SO much easier to just keep everything in and put MORE money into your positions on red days.

**What I am doing now to not repeat the same mistake:** I got back into the game late last year and I will not touch my investments ever again. I have also set aside a 4-ish month emergency fund that I will never touch. I believe part of the reason why I sold during the covid drop was also because I didnt have an emergency fund set aside and I got emotional with my investments. Now even my portfolio drops 50% in 1 day I still have 4 months of living expenses if I lost my job so I would still be carrying out my day to day living normally

**23andme is a consumer DNA-testing company. They were founded in 2006 and seems to have a huge market share for d2c DNA testing.**

Going into the future, I believe that many people will definitely have their DNA sequenced. This is not a fad or a gimmick. Sure, some people might buy a DNA test for novelty purposes to find out their ancestry, but by sequencing your DNA, you would be able to identify a HUGE array of potential health issues. Wanna have a kid? You'd want to know what potential diseases you may pass on. Cancer risk? You can find your risk factor early and keep tabs on it. I am almost certain that doctors will soon recommend this as a standard health practice.

Now on to the quick financials: the merger deal puts the company at a $3.5bn valuation and they'd end up with **$900m in cash.**

**That's a cash ratio of just over 3:1. If that isn't insane value, you tell me what is.**

* They'd also be able to use your gene data for specific diseases to develop drugs to treat them. H U G E
* Predictive abilities will improve as their dataset grows. Eg. they have a tool that tells you whether you would get severe symptoms in the event that you do catch COVID-19. This tech will improve and become a necessity to a modern healthcare plan
* Usually IPOs are first offered to institutional investors, by the time it hits the market, normal retail investors like you and me end up paying the highest prices for the shares. But with a SPAC like $VGAC, we're getting in on the ground level.
* &#x200B;

**I can see this doubling or tripling in value in the near future just based off of how cheap the prices are right now.**

Other biotech stocks typically trade at 30-40 PE ratio. If we use that multiple on their $220M current revenue, the company would be worth between $6.6bn - $8.8bn....

Biovaxys has developed a simple, low-cost procedure for manufacturing its Covid-19 vaccine – BVX0320.  The recombinant S1 subunit of the spike protein is incubated with dinitrobenzene sulfonate for 18 hours, and then the excess hapten is washed out. Hapten modification of the protein is demonstrated by standard methods. The DNP-modified S1 subunit is aliquoted and frozen in a standard freezer until use.

BVX-0320 has been found to be highly immunogenic in a murine model. Graded doses of vaccine (10ug, 3ug, 1ug, or 0.3ug) were mixed with QS21 adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. Two doses were administered – priming dose followed 4 weeks later by a boosting dose.  High titers of antibody to the unmodified S1 subunit, measured by ELISA, were detected in all mice given the 3ug and 10ug doses; median titers were 1:9,430 and 1:4,800 in the 3ug and 10ug groups, respectively. Perhaps more importantly, significant activation of T cells, both CD4 and CD8, was observed.  No significant toxicity was observed in the mice, even at the highest dose.

The Biovaxys haptenization strategy constitutes a platform technology in that it is adaptable to almost any virus-derived protein.  A significant mutation in the spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 could render ineffective all of the vaccines currently in clinical development.  Biovaxys has the capacity to rapidly respond to the development of a mutation, simply by substituting the mutated for the original protein.  Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that currently available recombinant viral protein vaccines could be improved by haptenization.

* The EU carbon market is a tiny market ready for disruption.
* Prices rose in 2020 despite a fall in emissions because the carbon market is in a deficit, but remains well below its fair price.
* Fundamentals are in place for a bull-run (rising demand as economies re-open, govt capping supply, EU drive to cut emissions further).
* Technicals suggest now is the time to buy, with a significant breakout on volume expansion, and no overhead supply.
* The KRBN ETF is the best way to go long carbon.

# EU carbon market is tiny market, ready for disruption

The EU carbon market works on a 'cap and trade' principle. A 'cap' is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases, and companies receive buy or sell allowances. Heavy polluters buy allowances from cleaner companies.

The EU's carbon market is the oldest and largest carbon market in the world. Yet, it is tiny in comparison with other commodities. It is limited to just 11,000 heavy energy-using installations in industries hand-picked by the EU (e.g. power stations and industry).

Every day, 32 million EU carbon allowances change hands. That's almost 3x less than GameStop's 97.71 daily trading volume (10-day moving average).

# Carbon market is in a deficit

Carbon prices rose in 2020 despite a 14% fall in emissions because the carbon market is in a deficit. They fell around the same time as the March sell-off, but recovered once vaccines were announced, and rose further in December when EU leaders agreed to more ambitious emissions reduction targets  (Source: [https://www.refinitiv.com/content/dam/marketing/en\_us/documents/reports/carbon-market-year-in-review-2020.pdf](https://www.refinitiv.com/content/dam/marketing/en_us/documents/reports/carbon-market-year-in-review-2020.pdf)).

Carbon prices have been in a clear uptrend since 2016, after the EU took steps to create a structural deficit, and have room to rise further:

* Every year, the EU reduces the total number of allowances by 1.47%.
* In 2015, the EU established a mechanism known as the Market Stability Reserve (MRS) to remove surplus allowances. In 2020 alone, the MRS reduced the 2020 auction volume by some 35% (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/carbon-market-report-emissions-eu-ets-stationary-installations-fall-over-9\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/carbon-market-report-emissions-eu-ets-stationary-installations-fall-over-9_en)).

A higher carbon price is a pillar of the EU's emissions reduction policy. And all signs point to a bull-run as demand rises further, and supply falls, driven by the EU's more ambitious emissions reduction targets.

Demand drivers:

* The economic recovery is ahead of us, with Covid vaccinations on the rise.
* By June 2021, the EU Commission will make proposals that could expand the EU ETS to more sectors and more gases. It has already stated its intention to include the maritime sector (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/)).
* By June 2021, the EU is expected to announce a carbon tax at its borders. This will further strengthen demand for EU carbon credits and prevent "carbon leakage". (Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-carbon/eu-sees-carbon-border-levy-as-matter-of-survival-for-industry-idUSKBN29N1R1?edition-redirect=in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-carbon/eu-sees-carbon-border-levy-as-matter-of-survival-for-industry-idUSKBN29N1R1?edition-redirect=in))

Supply drivers:

* The EU has announced that it will increase the pace of annual reductions in allowances to 2.2% (up from 1.47%) starting in 2021 (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision_en)).
* The EU has announced that it will double the number of allowances put in the Market Stability Reserve until 2023. Allowances in reserve will expire faster, further restricting supply (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision_en)).

# Carbon price above 100 Euros?

Institutional investors are confident that the price is on a clear upward trend. The following snippets are sourced from Bloomberg (Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/andurand-sees-carbon-tripling-as-funds-turn-bullish-on-pollution](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/andurand-sees-carbon-tripling-as-funds-turn-bullish-on-pollution))

Andurand Capital Management, which successfully bet on oil prices after the 2020 crash, expects that carbon will "**hit 100 Euros** ($121) per metric ton of carbon emissions, possibly as soon as later this year". If their forecasts are accurate, we'd see prices rise 160% above current levels.

Per Lekander, fund manager at London-based Lansdowne, sees carbon prices **between 50 Euros and 100 Euros** per ton within a year or two, partially boosted by demand from steel, cement and airlines. Anything below 50 Euros would be too low to meaningfully influence any industry outside the power sector, he said.

Northlander Commodity Advisors also predicting a surge this year to **50 Euros and 70 Euros** by 2025. According to its Ulf Ek, chief investment officer at Northlander, "It’s the best time to invest since early 2018".

The downside risk is that the EU intervenes to cap prices, should they rise too high too fast. However, I see two mitigating factors. First, the EU is notoriously slow to act, with decisions turnaround stretching over years. Second, the EU could support industries affected by excessively high carbon prices through tax breaks / subsidies, without directly interfering with the price of carbon itself.

# KRBN: KFA Global Carbon ETF

The KRBN ETF is long carbon. This actively managed ETF aims to exceed the returns achieved by the IHS Markit Global Carbon Index. To this end, it invests primarily in EU and, to a lesser extent, Californian carbon allowance futures. It has an 0.79% expense ratio, towards the low end for actively managed funds and small in relation to the potential upside.

**KOSPI Touches 3,000**

In early January, investors rejoiced when they heard the news that the Korea Stock Price Index, or KOSPI, passed the 3,000-point threshold. The KOSPI is a capitalization-weighted index of all common stocks exchanged on the main board of the Korea Stock Exchange. As a benchmark index of the Korean stock market, it follows a variety of industries, bonds, options, and futures.

When the KOSPI was first introduced in 1983, it was traded at 122.52 points. It reached its worst point, 31.96, during the 1998 financial crisis. In 2020, with the quick spread of the COVID-19 virus, the KOSPI dropped to 1,457.84 points on March 19. However, it rebounded and reached the 3,000-point plateau in the first week of January. The index increased by [30.8%](https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/12/30/2020123002203.html) (Korean link) over the year, which is the highest increase rate among the G20 countries’ stock indices.

The main driving force behind this remarkable increase seems to be [individual investors](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210106002200320) purchasing local stocks on the mainboard, as Yonhap reported. Individual investors purchased a net ₩38.1 trillion worth of local stocks from March 1 to December 30, 2020. In contrast, during the same period, non-Korean stockholders sold a net ₩21.5 trillion and institutions discharged a net ₩8.2 trillion.

**Young “Ants” Swarming into the Stock Market**A particular aspect of this increase is that a vast number of individual investors newly jumped into the market. To describe this phenomenon, internet slang expressions such as the “Donghak Ant Movement (동학개미운동)” emerged. The Donghak Ant Movement is a compound of two words: “Ant” and the “Donghak Movement”.Ant as a slang term refers to individual investors who don’t know much about the stock market compared to professional, full-time investors. The Donghak Movement is an uprising that took place in 1894, during the Joseon Dynasty. The movement was led and organized by peasants against feudalism and the invasion of foreign powers.The term “Donghak Ant Movement” started to become popular on the internet, as people joked about the “ants” buying local stocks to prevent the steep decline of the KOSPI caused by non-Korean investors’ offloading being similar to those peasants who fought against foreign powers. As mentioned above, the KOSPI had dramatically dropped after non-Korean investors and institutions offloaded their stocks, but the Korean ants [raised the index](https://www.donga.com/news/Society/article/all/20200407/100547492/1) (Korean link) to a record-high number by [purchasing more stocks](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210106000969) in response. The emergence of the term thus illustrates the noticeable change that occurred in the stock market last year: an increase in private, domestic investors.

The new, rather inexperienced ants were instigated to participate in the happenings on the stock market by an influx of newly launched mobile trading system (MTS) [applications](https://www.hankyung.com/economy/article/2021020330926) (Korean link). 

MTS applications allow users to trade small shares of a company’s stock, which enable them to start investing with a small amount of seed money with no transaction fees charged. Users can also open bank accounts for stock trading, or share accounts via the applications, without visiting banks. What’s more, many of these applications adopt artificial intelligence or other systems to provide [consulting services](http://www.newspim.com/news/view/20200904000641) (Korean link) and recommendations for their users.

Thanks to the improved accessibility to the stock market through MTS applications, the number of individuals making small investments in stocks has increased in the country. Compared to 2019, [more than four times](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2020/12/1279378/) (Korean link) the number of individual share accounts were opened in 2020.

MTS applications are also the main channel to the stock market in general. According to the Korea Exchange, MTS applications represent [40.66%](https://weekly.donga.com/3/all/11/2239376/1) (Korean link) of all transactions, followed by the home trading system (38.89%), branch terminals (10.44%), and automated response service (0.23%), in 2019. The [home trading system](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2013/08/123_90219.html) refers to computer software for stock trading.

Notably, more people in their 20s or 30s, mostly inexperienced in stock trading, recently jumped into the stock market with the help of these MTS applications. The term *julin-i* (주린이), a union of the prefix *ju-* (주식, stock) and the suffix *-lin-i* (short for 어린이, child), started to circulate on the internet as the number of young investors increased. The term denotes “newbies” who don’t have a good understanding of the stock market yet.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Protecting your profit. Please share your method Hi guys I’m reading through Mark Minervini book and he mentioned once your profit has double your initial risk at 15% profit (-7% stop loss) you should start to move your stop loss to your original buy point so it becomes an either neutral or profitable trade. 

After more profits Mark would use a trailing stop loss to closely monitor the price and exit in a favorable position with his profit in tact. This is the part where I’m confused. I understand that trailing stop loss follows price increases and stops when price decreases. So what would my stop loss be if I have 20,30,40% profit?

Right now one of my trade has a 20% profit. I set the stop loss at break even + 5%. Giving the trade a 15% wiggle room, is this too much room? The stock exchange I use has a 7% limit fluctuations for every stock meaning it cannot go below 7% any given day.

Thanks for your input!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Crypto futures ONLY brokers  

Hi Beautiful people,

Does anyone know any reputed broker who offers trading(buy/sell/hold) ONLY the futures of crypto currency as opposed to the underlying currency and does not charge horrendous interest rates (25%) for the same?

IMPORTANT: Without going into the detail reasons(security risks), the broker I am looking for should NOT allow buying the underlying crypto under any circumstances. Hence, ONLY crypto futures.

Based on my preliminary research I found that Binance offers Crypto futures with a decent interest rate of 8-10%. However, I do not know if they have an account type which ensures that my account CANNOT be used to buy underlying crypto.

Any insights would be appreciated.

Thanks,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cannabis Stocks in light of announced regulations Hey Boys and Girls, 

would like to know what you think of the US push to further decirminalize cannabis on the federal level? 

in my view there are several considerations around this regulatory change that could positively influence investment outlook:

1.The no brainer states that want to decriminalize or already have have a better legal backing. 

2.Companies suddenly will have access to non-venture funding, banking services (which as I understand at this point is not the case) 

3. Will become more intersting investment case for the traditional market (pension funds etc)

4.Could be the new tabacco or alcohol?

Which company will win is on a diffrent page, but maybe you guys have a few ideas.

Max_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Crash is Coming? Here's Why the Risks Are High  

Hi to everybody reading this, I am an investor based in Europe focusing a lot of my studies on the United States market primarily. Most of my research and time is spent perfecting my forecasting skills, not through a lot of bullshit that seems to have thrived, but through analyzing of value. Value's aspects are where true returns can always be found, and the only problem value can face is the price you pay. I'm writing this because of the opinion I have on the economic state of the market that is about to appear at any time.

A market crash can happen for many reasons, but forget that and let's get specific. The Dotcom crash was a major crash that happened around 2000, the reason for it is the same reason I believe the upcoming crash will happen.

What is it?

It's speculation.

But what's wrong with speculation?

**NOTHING.**

You bet on the market depending on what you believe is going to happen to certain industries, and that is not only a method for great profits but something anyone should have the access to do. If the story ended there it would be great. The issue is that the rate at which speculation is taking place, has reached a new level. Therefore when putting the price you pay for stocks, against their actual earnings you get an estimate of how overvalued the stock market is. This ratio is high. Really high.

But isn't that because companies are growing?

Not even close.

Ratio is a relationship, if price grows faster than the actual performance of companies, that is a case of being overvalued and not reflecting company growth anymore. What to do? Well, watch your trades, make sure you know what you're buying/selling and make sure that **crowd's opinion isn't always yours too.**

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I am bearish on BB (technical analysis) I'm a Software Eng. and therefore will only cover the technical aspects. As you might already see in the title, I'm bearish on BB. I decided to share my thoughts, since a lot of people (and analysts) seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stock.I want to give a quick and **very abstract** introduction on technical terms:

# Technicalities

BB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.

Why would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.

However some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# Contra BB (QNX):

The following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):

1. Toyota
2. VW
3. Daimler
4. Ford
5. Honda
6. BMW
7. GM

&#x200B;

1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).
2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.
3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.
4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.
5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.
6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.
7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.

I didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)

# Pro BB (QNX):

Developing an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).

# Conclusion

In my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).

Furthermore I just searched through job listings for "QNX" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).

Although Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.

Given the scare of pandemic, for next few years, everyone will likely be forced to take annual jab (or at the very least travellers should need vaccination proof for quite sometime)

When it comes to next jab, people are most likely to go for Novavax because:

1. Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer
2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $17B when Moderna is valued at $65B`. To reach $65B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1070**

Six months ago I came across REIT that was absolutely crushed by the pandemic. Most of their revenue came from two major tenants that stopped paying rent, so as you'd expect their stock plummeted and were forced to slash dividends. 

**Quick Background:**

Their asset Pinedale was leased by UPL but as bankruptcy proceedings threated to terminate the lease CORR decided to sell pinedale to UPL for $18MM. Pinedale at the time consisted of \~26% of CorEnergy's total assets and \~31% of its total revenue in 2019. 

Second tenant is Energy XXI GIGS Services LLC who was leasing the GIGS pipeline. GIGS consisted of \~32% of their Total Assets and \~47% of their Total Revenue. Lawsuit was in full swing to try and recover past due rent.

**Crimson California Pipeline deal:**

I don't normally invest in Micro caps but CORR stayed on my radar. The potential acquisition of another income producing asset and the on-going lawsuit with Energy XXI kept me tuned and I wanted to see if management could locate a great deal and recoup some of the past due rent.

Today CORR announced their "secret" acquisition they've been working on for months. After reading through the press release, the current management team looks like they got absolutely fleeced. Below is a snapshot of the so-called Deal. Keep in mind this management team bought GIGS 5 years ago for **$245m**.

**Crimson Midstream Holdings Deal Overview:**

\- **Total Deal Value**: $350m

**CORR Financing:**

\- $75.6m in cash  
\- $105m in a new loans  
\- $120m in equity dilution

All of the above is a steep price to pay given how small and desperate they are to resume paying adequate dividends; however, it also mentions "contribution of the Grand Isle Gathering System (GIGS) to the sellers". Yeah, you read that right.. The Total deal is valued for $350MM, UPL owes them at least $20m; therefore, they are essentially selling GIGS for $30m when they bought this asset only 5 years ago for $245m..   


The Crimson asset is looking to add an annual run rate EBITDA at \~$50m, which prior to COVID was in the ballpark of what GIGS was currently producing.. I was hoping I misread that press release but after going to other websites and articles, it appears others are drawing a similar conclusion.

**My thoughts:**  


This was a major let down given the speculative possibilities that were floating around. Fortunately, there is conference call tomorrow at 10AM EST. Only then we can get more info around this deal. 

If the deal is what I think it is then the only potential positive outcome is John Grier (founder and Board chairman of Crimson Midstream) will become the new COO and join the Board of Directors of CorEnergy along with Robert Waldron (CFO at Crimson) who will step in as the new CFO. 

I haven't been able to dig much into John Grier and Robert Waldron yet but with recent history, any shake up to the current management team is a good thing.

Let me know if you agree/disagree._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $APHA and $TLRY merger is an interesting merger arbitrage opportunity, but is ANYONE completely how call options play out here? This is what I think I've learned: Hello!

So obviously buying shares is (in a theoretical perfect world) about a ~30% profit per share just from the conversion alone. That's gonna add up quick and I'm excited about that part. Moving on. 

My question that I'd like to try to get more info on is exactly how the options play out? My understanding is that since it is an all stock deal, call options will be controlling 83 options instead of the 100, but they **retain the strike price.**? So my $15 APHA call (100 x $15 ) would become a TLRY $15c (83 x $15). 

I'm not concerned with liquidity drying up, and I understand these will become non standard (or exotic) options. I'm happy to just exercise and maybe sell some shares to keep profit and hold the majority long. So my contract exercise price would be $1,245: correct?

On a train bound for nowhere  
I met up with the gambler  
We were both too tired to sleep  
So we took turns a-starin'  
Out the window at the darkness  
The boredom overtook us  
And he began to speak

He said, "Son, I've made a life

So I handed him my bottle  
And he drank down my last swallow  
Then he bummed a cigarette  
And asked me for a light  
And the night got deathly quiet  
And his face lost all expression  
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy

And when he'd finished speakin'  
He turned back toward the window  
Crushed out his cigarette

Livent is scheduled due to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility.

**Key Catalysts:**

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe.

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens.

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America.

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

**Financials and Valuation**

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve.

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

But I want to remind the people that you could be exasperating some serious inner self-turmoil for many people based on these words causing their mental health to be in ruins.

**My Perspective about Holding - Hindsight 20/20 - May put your mind at ease**

Holding is not a bad idea granted you could actually afford to which is what I feel people missed out on.

The point is, it wasn't completely horrible to get involved because truly, hindsight is 20/20 for situations like this. This was an unprecedented event in the likes the world has literally never seen. How could you possibly have predicted it to the tee? You can't pretend like you're the smartest in the room that saw all this coming. You can only extrapolate the data as it comes and watch as the event unfolds.

I'd say you can call it more of a gamble than an investment, but it doesn't take a genius to understand that when getting in. The fact is, expectations should have been set better for all the new people that joined.

Like I said earlier, the only people to worry about are the ones who truly have lost a majority of their wealth from this. I'm all about the movement but realistically if I invested at the starting price before it spiked to $400, I probably would've sold enough to cover my initial investment and kept the rest to be a part of the movement.

&#x200B;

**Some Lives Have Been Destroyed... Let's not deny it**

There are some people here that really went all out. Like I don't know if you've been paying attention, but I've seen it on blogs, on many subreddits, on social media. Some people really have gone ALL OUT or have thrown a majority of their wealth on this.

If this is the case, I'd start talking to a financial advisor immediately about what your next steps are. My deepest sympathies go out to the guys and gals who are feeling breathless and suffocated in these times, that in it of itself has been giving me more anxiety than anything else. Just looking at all the people who put in way more than they could chew... it honestly destroys me. I have anxiety myself and I can't imagine what you people are going through right now.

I can see people hurting themselves over the decisions that have been made in the past 2 weeks. Especially with the pandemic at an all time high and already causing mental health ruin, this does not help.

For the people that feel destroyed - you are going to get through this. I know it really sucks but you will. Life can change at an instant at any second the same way it can go to shit. The same way you feel you're never going to find that person to fall in love with and the next second some gorgeous girl is going out with your ugly bum. In either case, little by little, you'll fix this and you'll have become stronger for it.

&#x200B;

**Upside and Lessons**

On the flip side, I and I'm sure many have had and are having a lot fun being a part of this movement. I hope this was a valuable lesson to many who had thrown everything in to not let emotions get in the way of making smart investment decisions.

This was a volatile market, and should have come in understanding that this was basically gambling money as much as it was an attempt at a short-term investment. Going forward, if you decide to stick around and invest in the stock market in general, it really can be an enjoyable experience to play with the numbers in a way that doesn't get your heart dropping every 2 seconds.

If any of you need to talk or are feeling low, the PMs are open, and I'm sure there are many people that can and will help you get through this.

**Closing thoughts... hold if you can afford it and have been in it for the movement. But don't have any expectations of this giving any real returns going forward.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ looking into the Semiconductor sector and comparing TSMC VS Intel Hi all,

I'm bullish on the whole semiconductor industry but get is to splitting hairs between the two largest chipmakers.  This choice was simpler before Intels new CEO brought back a renewed vigor in manufacturing and Development,

Looking at the balance sheets and market parameters.  I would say TSMC has the advantage in the market cap of "608 B" and Growth projections of "10-15%" vs Intel's advantage dividend yield "2.51%" and Free cash flow of "20B".

I work in the engineering department for a city of roughly 120,000 people and like the rest of country, the infrastructure that was constructed 50+ years ago is starting to degrade and need replacing. One of the most important parts of any system is how it can convey water to the outfall during rain events. Back in the day, the pipes used for storm water were made of concrete. Sure, they are very strong, and if constructed right, will last a while. We have a 72” line that was constructed in 1927 and is mainly in good condition. 

Unfortunately, these concrete pipes are falling apart nowadays. So, instead of replacing them with the same material pipe, we were introduced to ADS, a company that specializes in polypropylene pipes. It’s essentially a very durable plastic that can last much longer to concrete when constructed properly. I can go into much more technical details such as the fact that ADS pipes come in 20ft sections instead of 8 ft sections like concrete, reducing the number of joints, which reduces the number of areas that can fail. Or the fact that it takes only 2-4 men to lift an WMS pipe compared to having an excavator lift a concrete pipe. 

There a number of advantages. Over the past year, the price has gone up $61.00.

Overall, this company hits my 4 big checks 

1. Founders are still operating the business with conviction
2. They have a clear mission & vision to improve the world with strong conviction 
3. The company's focus is product obsession
4. The company can last longer than 2.5 years running at a loss & is recession resistant (this would be better if it would benefit in a recession).


**Financial Health**

The company consistantly has 68-75% gross margin. They have 3x current assets to current liabilities and can run for 4 years given 2020's burn rate. This is impressive considering that COVID-19 fucked the world. The company reached profitability 1 qtr earlier than expected & did it during a global pandemic. The company also has 25% liabilities to assets. 

Compared to ALGN there is a lot of upside. ALGN has 1.3 B in sales & is trading at 19.5x sales. SDC is 670 M in sales & is at ~8.5x sales. With a 31.8% short float with an average cost of < $11. A squeeze is in the making come earnings on Feb 22nd. 


**Bull Case **

SDC can increase club members through using teeth whitening & multichannel (destist, retail, smile shops, mobile app, & web) to get corrective straighteners. International expansion & improving capture in the U.S. will turn the company to profitability. 

On top of that the company plans on expanding into other products lines such as teeth whitening & hardcore orthodontics applications. 

**Bear Case** 

The company's products do not work as advertised. The customer satisfaction ratings are over inflated due to strict NDA's for refunds. The results are worse than expected & FDA plus state regulatory agencies will require dental professionals ruining the teledentist model in person as a result. This is a fad that will die. 

NYT Article It Has A Few Valid Points But It's Mainly FUD - published Q1 2020
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/technology/smiledirectclub-smile-nda.amp.html 

Valid Point: SDC is a general solution that occasionally screws up edges cases where the consumer has problems beyond the products abilities. This is a defining attribute to their business model & as a result the company requires NDA's for refunds. 


**Bear Case Flaws** 

There are roughly ~780,000 known successful cases and 2,900 known BBB complaints. That's ~2% dissatisfaction rate. This rate is much higher than ALGN & is because the SDC allows consumers to do a fiting at home & consumers don't understand the limitations of SDC's product relative to their condition. 

The company has responded beautifully through encouraging customers to go to partnered dental professionals & has had +70% of customers take this route. As you can see on their BBB page all 2,900 customer complaints have been addressed and the few class action lawsuits that I could find were shut down by the company's terms & conditions. 

In the Q3 earnings call the CEO & founder addresses this problem directly & states that the company has built the multichannel sales network to support any consumers path (mold, dentist, web, mobile app, or smile direct center). 

State regulators do not care because the end result of a customer using the product the wrong way is an open bite. Plus the company recommends going to dental professionals in their network & warns the consumer about the risks ahead of time.

Whitening products are in CVS, Wall Greens, & are being piolated in 300 Wal-Marts. This is the funneling strategy for more long term customers. 

**Time Herizon & The Trade**

Given today's movement there is a short term sell off. A price below 11.10 is a good price & hold for 2 years. This qtr alone there is a 30% upside in the stock. Anything below 10.00 is a steal. Sense earnings has the potiential to be a second profitable qtr short term options plays exist. 

I plan on buying March 19 calls 2 weeks prior to earnings 3.5 bucks OTM.  


There is a 2.5x upside in valuation alone at current sales. Long term there is a 4.5x - 5x opportunity at maturity. I am holding stock at $12.90. 


**Economic Moat**
After some digging their economic moat is similar to what we see in software. The company relies on speed to market, network connections, & the patent system to slow others down or block out the competition. After reading the patent abstracts the patents are wide enough to cause a legal basis for litigation even if it's on frivolous claims for every aspect of their business from replicating the process Tele Medicine all the way down to the imaging tech & manufacturing capabilities. For perspective a cheap patent litigation attorney costs 1,100 per hour and you would need a team of 5 to 7. An in-house patent team would cost 1.5 M to 2 M annually on the low end. 

Overall, there is not a specific set of tech that blocks out others ... however, the combination of speed, manufacturing ability, patent trolling, and establishing a network of dental professionals creates a significant barrier of entry. If another startup or incumbent were to pivot into the space they would have to beat the price, experience, & speed of service by atleast 1.75x to justify an upset.

Let’s get right into it.

# What is MARA?

MARA stands for Marathon Patent Group. Yes, you read that correctly. Now, you may be asking yourself “is this dude telling me to invest in a fucking patent troll?” Yes and no. First of all, this isn’t a patent troll, and second, Mara mines bitcoin. If you’re familiar with bitcoin mining, then you may have heard of RIOT. That is what I will be comparing Mara to today.

Now, this is an extremely risky investment. Mara has a ton to prove, but if they keep up to their contracts, this is gonna be insane growth.

Let’s get to it.

With 103,060 miners ordered and contracted with Bitmain, Mara plans to be the biggest bitcoin mining facility in North America by Q1 2022. This represents 6.4% of the global bitcoin hash rate and will produce about 55-60 bitcoin per day. Both Mara and Riot use [Bitmain Antminer S19s](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A), which mine at a hash rate of 110 TH/s at the pro version. Now, mining *can* be profitable, however, it depends on a few factors. These factors include the cost of electricity, difficulty rate of mining bitcoin, price of bitcoin, price of miners, etc. The lower the cost of electricity and miners, the more revenue possible. Many seem to believe that mining will stop being profitable over time, specifically as difficulty rates become harder and harder. That’s true depending on the level. If a company is able to keep their electricity costs low, and the mining hash rate high, then the profits will come in. Especially if they have a massive rig. (100k miners is FUCKING massive btw)

# Exposure to Bitcoin

Mara two weeks ago [invested in themselves](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1224/marathon-invests-150-million-in-bitcoin) by purchasing 4,812.66 bitcoin at a price of about $150 million. That means they purchased these at an average of $31,167 per bitcoin. What a fucking play. They perfectly timed the recent dip. So in literally two weeks, that $150 million is now worth $180 million. $30 million in profit just like that. This purchase also helps Marathon accelerate the process of being tied to bitcoin closely.

# Contracts/Partnerships

**Bitmain**

Bitmain is a business based in Beijing, China that designs and builds application-specific integrated chip circuits for bitcoin mining. Bitmain is an incredible partner and will support Mara as they build to become one of the largest and most efficient miners in North America. In December, Mara [announced](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1218/marathon-patent-group-purchases-70000-s-19-asic-miners) the largest order that Bitmain has ever received. 70,000 S-19 ASIC miners at a total cost of $168,000,000. This order brings Mara at a total of 103,060 miners, with planned deployment by Q1 2022. These miners will be shipped out on a monthly basis to Mara. [4 days ago](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) Bitmain shipped 4,000 S-19 miners from a previous order in which Mara expects to have all 4,000 miners fully deployed by the end of this month, February. This will increase Mara’s total miners to 6,560 from 2,560. This shipment is only the first of the many shipments that Mara expects to receive from Bitmain in the entirety of 2021. Mara anticipates another 6,300 miners in March and 4,800 in April, putting them at a total of 17,660 miners by May 1st.

**Beowulf Energy**

Beowulf Energy is a private business that develops and operates power generation worldwide. As of today, Beowulf owns and manages over 2.3 GW of power generation capacity worldwide. Mara holds a partnership with Beowulf Energy to receive a supply of consistent low-cost electricity at a fixed rate of $0.028/kWh. This decreases a lot of risks as Mara will have access to consistent power at a fixed price, meaning that over time, mining margins will be consistent and increase minimally. This also increases Mara’s profitability as the average price of electricity in the US is over $0.08/kWh. Beowulf Energy also owns 6 million shares of Marathon, which means Beowulf will always have Mara’s best interests in mind. At this electricity cost, Marathon expects every single bitcoin mined to cost about $4,500/bitcoin\* once the full rig is deployed. (\*This is calculated using January 2020 bitcoin mining difficulty.) Assuming the cost of bitcoin is just $30,000/bitcoin, which’s about $50 million in revenue per month and $43.6 million in gross profit per month for Mara. This means that if the price of bitcoin continues in an upward trend, then profits for Mara will literally multiply. Insane.

Now for the good stuff. Let’s get into the numbers and potential profit here. First, I want to compare Mara to Riot in the short term and long term as they are two head to head companies competing in the bitcoin mining territory. As of right now, both companies trade almost identically, although Mara’s market cap is 1.95 Billion and Riot’s is 1.45 Billion. I see Mara blowing past Riot in the near future.

# Key Dates/Timeline

Marathon’s current mining fleet consists of 2,560 miners, generating 248 PH/s, or .24 EH/s. Remember when I talked about Mara’s expected shipments in the next few months? That’s gonna come in handy here. Here are some key dates I’ve compiled for Mara.

**2,560 Miners (248 PH/s) as of February 1st**

*On pending order: 93,520 miners remaining*

\+4,000 (+440 PH/s) - End of February - expects 688 PH/s (.68 EH/s)

\+6,300 (+693 PH/s) - End of March - expects 1381 PH/s (1.38 EH/s)

\+4,800 (+528 PH/s) - End of April - expects 1909 PH/s (1.9 EH/s)

**Expected 17,660 (1,909 PH/s) Miners as of May 1st**

*On pending order: 88,020 miners remaining*

As of today, Mara has about 2,560 miners set up and expects 17,660 miners by the beginning of May, which in theory should put their hash rate at 1.9 EH/s as of May 1st.

Mara expects to go from 2,560 miners to 17,660 which is an increase of 1.6 EH/s at a total of 1.9 EH/s

\-------------------------

**Now for Riot...**

**7,040 (567 PH/s) as of February 1st**

*On pending order: 30,600 miners remaining*

\+2500 (+275 PH/s) Beginning of February - expects 842 PH/s (.84 EH/s)

\+5500 (+605 PH/s) End of May - expects 1446 PH/s (1.45 EH/s)

**Expected 15,040 (1,446 PH/s) Miners as of May 1st**

*On pending order: 22,600 miners remaining*

As of today, Riot currently has about 9,540 miners set up and expects 15,040 miners by the beginning of May, which in theory should put their hash rate at 1.45 EH/s as of May 1st. Riot expects to go from 7,040 miners to 15,040 which is an increase of .89 EH/s at a total of 1.45 EH/s

That’s just short term too. If we look at the longer-term data we currently have, **by Q1 2022**, Mara expects 103,060 (10.36 EH/s) miners producing 55-60 bitcoin per day at a cost of $4,541/bitcoin (assuming today’s difficulty rates). **By October 2021**, Riot only expects 37,640 (3.8 EH/s) miners. That’s an insane difference by the beginning of next year. That means Mara will have a 6.56 EH/s edge on Riot which is fucking massive and will shoot Mara past Riot by a landslide.

Anyways, I’m getting pretty tired and I want to post this today as there’s an insane buying opportunity tomorrow morning as the dip today was massive. There’s so much more information about this and so much more I want to talk about. I encourage everyone to do some DD and decide for themselves, but the factors I’ve talked about are the main driving factors in my investment. To sum it up, Mara is hoping for 55-60 daily bitcoin production in Q1 2022 which will result in $60.1 million in revenue a month assuming bitcoin is worth $35,000/bitcoin. This is an insane opportunity for anyone here that is bullish on bitcoin and wants to put in some risk for some insane growth potential here. I encourage everyone to at least take a look at Marathon’s [presentation](https://content.equisolve.net/_16b475e371012841e1a1decd3e626707/marathonpg/db/184/3127/pdf/MARA+IR+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf).

# This is probably the most important part of the DD.

So putting it all together… we can find the sum of the parts (SOTP). [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/big-picture-mara-stock-could-easily-double/) article is a good read and I’ll sum it up here:

[This](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/92378/nasdaq-marathon-patent-group-buys-bitcoin-btc-treasury-reserves) article gives us a good estimate to find the SOTP. In the article, it is mentioned that Marathon still has another $100 million from the $250 million recently raised, along with the $450 million in other cash according to their books. So adding it all together, we have $180 million in bitcoin plus $550 million in cash, bringing in a total of $730 million in total. This doesn’t even include the value of Mara’s bitcoin operation either, and considering the recent contract with Bitmain, Mara is expected to be one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the world. If we want to value the operation, we can do so pretty easily. If we assume production of 55-60 bitcoin per day, that’s about $2 million at current prices per day. If we add on the electricity costs of $0.028/kWh, that brings us down to the cost of about $4,500 per bitcoin mined. This means that the gross operating margin will be about $1.75 million per day. If the price of bitcoin rises, this will increase the margins significantly as well. **That means if we get what we want, then Mara will run a rate of $631.9 million gross profits a year.** At a 5% operating cost (Mara only has 3 employees), we can assume a $600 million in free cash flow. At 20% net tax, the net income will be $480 million annually, and at just six times earnings Mara stock would be worth $2.88 billion alone. Adding in the SOTP value, the stock market cap is worth $3.63 billion. That’s almost double the current market cap of $1.95 billion. Also, the market can easily value the mining operation at 5x or 10x multiples. The sky is literally the limit here.

**Basically, Mara is worth at least 90% more than its current $23 price, and potentially substantially more depending on what the market will value. And if bitcoin keeps on rising (which is likely), both Mara’s crypto holdings and gross margins will multiply. I am extremely bullish on Mara and expect it to pump an insane amount.**

My price target is $50 per share in about 6 or so months (This is a pretty damn conservative target as well).

  [https://tos.mx/VPuILrE](https://tos.mx/VPuILrE)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here is why I am bullish on G.E. Here is why I am bullish on G.E.    . . .     "this is not financial advise"

I think G.E. had a huge down turn because a new CEO and management came in and shook things up, then he left, then another one came in and left. That combined with crippling debt and a heavy investment into sectors that were "old technology" pretty much poised them as a failing company. HOWEVER, there is stability and a massive change of direction for G.E. in these last few years. They are focusing on new and fresh ideas and sectors of the market. I am mad bullish on G.E. I think they are currently fairly valued... but theres potential! After COVID with aviation and with Joe Biden's green energy plan being implemented it is going to become a massive force. I think they are healthy after divesting themselves from "less important" future assets, pulling in a decent chunk of capital, began paying down huge chunks of debt, and changing direction to a more future "relevant" selection of sectors. I think aviation and green energy are going to continue to boom, and now that G.E. has built itself larger roots in those sectors I think they will be along for the ride.

Are they going to explode? Probably not. I don't think they are going to leap from $10 to $100 in the next year. But I think in the next 5 we might see them double, maybe even triple if they keep the direction and focus they have been showing. I think their earnings reports might scare people away, but I think if you look at the overall direction there is MASSIVE potential.

If I am wrong I would love to know._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Books on Factor Investing Due to being enrolled in an Msc Finance during the day I spent plenty of time reading academic papers some of which regard factor investing.
I often find at the end of the day I have exhausted my capabilities to rigourously read academic papers, but have not satiated my hunger for more knowledge about factors and factor investing.

I am looking for books written in more casual language that discuss factors and factor investing.

I have spotted “Quantitative Value” by Gray & Carlisle and also “Your complete guide to factor investing” by Berkin & Swedroe. Are they appropriate for what I am looking for. Also any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Warning: Do not use your Paypal account to buy Crypto unless you like giving your hard to come by profits away. I thought; "it was there, it was easy and I didn't want to wait days for money to finally land in another account."  They have fees that on the surface don't seem awful, until you do the math. Here's a quick example and a best case scenario too.  You use your PP account to buy $5000 worth of coin, their fee is a "modest" 1.5% for that (fees are higher below $1000) So you paid $75 right out of the gate, now let's say it has (a very unlikely) run and wow you doubled your money. You cash out at $10k, now PP takes another $150 (1.5%) to sell your coin. So your actual profits are $5000 and your PP fees are $250, boom they zinged you for **5% of your total profits.** And that's all best case scenario.

Edit: If you think that's not bad still. another far more likely scenario is you buy $5k worth make a nice $1000 profit, the total fees would be $180, so out of your net profits you'd lose 18%._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment Strategy Theory I am a new trader, but I have been investing for about 6 months.
