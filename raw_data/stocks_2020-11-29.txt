 How are people who have advisors via Fidelity, Vanguard etc doing? vs people who manage their own portfolios here? Because this last year has been absolutely crazy, and some people have seen massive differences in their returns I want to know how people feel about managing their own portfolios vs having their portfolios managed for them by a personal advisor

I've had OK returns this year...about 13%...I've been questioning moving my money into an account managed by Vanguard and if I did I would qualify for a vanguard personal advisor (over 1 million).

I am so annoyed by my companies 401k plan. It’s more of a glorified savings account and I’m not seeing the growth I’d like. Over three years I have a total principal of 28000 invested and as of today it’s grown to 31000. So my ROI Is 9.6%. The reason my 401 sucks is there are no aggressive stock mutual funds offered and I have maybe 5 other fund options distributed between small/medium/large caps. I also don’t get stock options from my job. I really feel like I’m losing money literally working for this shit company and I’m actively applying to other jobs. In the meantime I need help to stop the bleeding. I’m allowed to take out half my 401 penalty free as a loan to myself. I was thinking of doing that and investing it in other mutual funds or fuck it like 5 growth stocks that will out compete the market in a year. 

What would you guys do in this situation? I really want to take out 15k and buy like a 100 shares of a couple of stocks and sell covered calls. And just keep the money rolling because the situation I’m in rn makes me want to throw up. 

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do technical analysis strategies work better on stocks/securities with certain characteristics? So some background info and disclaimer:

I'm a younger, newer investor who got in at the beginning of May with basic layman knowledge of the markets, so apologies for any ignorance or stupid questions. So anyway, when I casually mentioned my interest in the stock market after the huge crash in March, my parents and some immediate family members were extremely supportive, so much so that they basically gifted me 30k to start an account.

As lucky and grateful as I am to have all this capital to work with, I have not been able to take proper advantage of it out of fear of failure. I haven't made any trades after loading up on tech during the recovery after the initial COVID sell-off, and in the meantime, I've been studying up on both fundamental and technical, boomer and wallstreetbets, value investing vs YOLOs (basically, trying to learn all perspectives so that I can confidently choose my own preferred style). I started with the Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, moved on the One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, and am now reading Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller in addition to taking an online technical analysis/daytrading course.

My question popped into my head as I was listening to the aforementioned daytrading course. I found myself wondering: "if there are certain characteristics of stocks that attract the attention of value investors like Graham, Buffet, and Lynch and prompt them to investigate further, are there equivalent characteristics for technical traders?" I mean, there are dedicated screeners that anyone can use that find stocks based on Graham's values and principles, and Lynch lays out his own criteria like "boring stock rich in assets in a boring industry with little no to institutional interest" for finding potential ten-baggers that retail investors could follow.

Which brings us to the question itself: Are there certain characteristics that short-term, technical day/swing traders screen for or like to see in their trade setups? From what I've been learning so far, the stock should be relatively liquid, and the more people using the technical chart setups that you are using, the better the probability that it will work out. But other than trading volume (and the presence of chart/indicator setups ofc), are there any other boxes a technical trader should check before pulling the trigger on a trade?

TLDR: Basically, tell me how to screen for stocks that have underlying traits that complement technical strategies, and if there are no such things let me know so I can go buy myself a dart monkey.

anyone else? advice?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Creating dividend by selling shares? I’ve heard about this idea a while ago however it’s still never made sense to me. Here’s the issues I have in my head

**Problem 1)** One thing that was mentioned to me was that when a company pays a dividend, it decreases its value and thus the same as selling shares (or something close to that). This doesn’t make sense to me, for this to be true, then a stock price/market cap must be directly correlated to the total value of that company....which never happens. Last time I checked KO, HD, MSFT and AAPL’s stock price didn’t fall after they paid their dividend. 

**Problem 2)** I’ve been told selling shares and dividends are “fundamentally the same” and I take issue with this as well. In order to receive a dividend, one doesn’t have to give up their ownership of a company; where as if you sell shares you are. It mathematically isn’t the same thing. 

Dividend paying stock: 100 shares x $1 = $100; and you’re left with 100 shares. 

Creating your own dividend: 100 shares - (sell) 5 shares = $100; but you’re now left with 95 shares. 

If selling shares and receiving a dividend were fundamentally the same then you wouldn’t see any difference between the two scenarios. 

**Problem 3)** People who hate dividends love to say Warren Buffett doesn’t care for dividends because he says there the same thing as selling shares and thus this is a reason why he doesn’t pay a dividend. Well....his actions speak differently, frequently he negotiates for higher yields and bigger dividends. Example, he negotiated with some of his bank stocks to get preferred shares that yield 10%. If he really was against dividends he would negotiate special shares that don’t pay a dividend. Right?

Now I’m not one of the people that only invest into dividend payers. I also understand dividends should only be paid if the company doesn’t really have anything to reinvest the cash into. 

But my question is...am I missing something?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell high or now? Hi, in my portfolio I have a rather large position of stocks from company A, which recently dropped by 20% before I could exit.

There are two ways I can see taxes being calculated, and I'd like to know which.

**Option 1**. Lets say hypothetically I only made two trades this year. Say both of these are realized, so I'm subject to short term capital gains tax (I didn't hold for more than a year)

1. I lost 10k on my first trade
2. I made 7k on my second trade

So I'm net down 3k. As far as I understand, because I'm net down, I wouldn't have to pay any taxes.

**Option 2**. However, I'm unsure if I'm misunderstanding and if the tax rate actually applies per trade. That is:

1. I lost 10k on the first trade so I don't pay taxes
2. I made 7k on my second trade so I pay taxes. Say I'm in a 30% bracket, so I pay 2.1k in taxes.

If this is the case, I'm actually net down 5.1k this year.

What’s your thoughts ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ China's 2021 new energy vehicle subsidies soar 234% to RMB 37.58 billion ($5 Billion)year on year China's Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently issued an early budget for new energy vehicle subsidies in 2021, with the total amount more than tripling that of 2020.

According to the "Notice on the Advance Issuance of 2021 Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Subsidy Budget (First Batch)" dated November 20, China will arrange new energy vehicle subsidies totaling RMB 37.585 billion in 2021, an increase of 234% over the 2020 amount of RMB 11.257 billion.

The amount of subsidies cleared for the 2016-2018 new energy vehicle promotion and application subsidies amounted to RMB 21.896 billion, including RMB 1.162 billion for the 2016 new energy vehicle promotion and application subsidies, RMB 6.363 billion for 2017, and RMB 14.372 billion for 2018. Among them, the subsidy for the operation of new energy buses in 2021 is RMB 15.689 billion, accounting for 41.74% of the total amount.

In 2020, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued the 2015-2018 new energy vehicle subsidies amounting to RMB 11.257 billion, including subsidies for the promotion of high-efficiency motor products and new energy vehicle products that meet the requirements.

The latest 2021 new energy vehicle subsidies target the operation of energy-saving and new energy bus and promotion of new energy vehicle products, and the 2021 subsidies are equivalent to 3.34 times the 2020 subsidies.

Everyone is aware that oil companies have had a difficult year and only recently after the great vaccine news have they recovered somewhat. I believe there is still room for recovery. Maybe I am completely in the wrong.

-	World oil rig count have decreased from around 826 to 492.
-	US oil rig count have decreased from around 688 to 266.

Obviously the lockdowns have decreased the need for oil immensely. But soon when the world opens up oil demands will increase sharply. But since there is less oil rigs and less oil in the market, it should create a competitive market where oil companies could benefit greatly from. That’s my theory at least.

In the short term (1-2 years) I don’t see why you shouldn’t invest in oil companies. Am I wrong?

And in less 2 weeks Pfizer might get the green light in US & EU and I think that might also boost the oil market further. This week should be a good buy opportunity.

What are the next interesting earnings reports? Let’s talk about the stock market!**

Hey everyone and Welcome so let’s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.

Monday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)

Reports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX & PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)

All this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)

Some good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.

We also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)

Moving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)

[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.

While October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. 

On Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.

About 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.

Also the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don’t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.

Also, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $.

We closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / 

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.

So for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.

So great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)

Also, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it’s value but for using it also.

This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.

Great news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)

Also, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won’t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio.

Next week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)

[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.

With [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.

Also, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it’s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.

Other companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.

It seems these people completely disregard any stock that goes up fast because they do not understand the innovation aspect and compounding growth these companies can experience due to how disruptive they are. Companies like plntr and tesla are not measured using traditional metrics there used to. So basically boomers disregard massive innovation (in my opinion). Kathie wood speaks about this a lot. That being said its hard to measure how valuable these obviously good companies are as there is a lot of meme pumping going on aswell. Is it possible a company like palantir is undervalued considering the massive application big data will have going forward and how they might incorporate there tech into the iot.

Does anyone know how to even search this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are “Growth” stocks inherently bad for investors long term? It sounds like a simple question with a simple answer (no company reinvesting increases price) but let’s dig a little deeper:

For the individual investor the stock price going up equals profit. This is the short term outlook and I acknowledge it.

But for the long term outlook:
When investors buy a stock there are only 3 routes where they (as a group) make profit:
1. Divided payment 
2. Stock repurchases 
3. Company liquidations
3b. Company getting acquired by another that performs (1) or (2)

Seeing as “growth” stocks do neither (1) or (2), and in many cases 3 occurs at overall loss; why are we buying these stocks at markup?

Or am I missing something?

Re: Growth stocks grow faster, hence when they do pay dividend the are worth more:

that makes no fiscal sense to investors as a whole

Stock value appreciate because a greater fool buys your stock at an overall loss for more money than the previous fool (in other words this is a net loss to investors as a group)

Then if we ignore appreciation the actual value extracted from the company is exclusively divided payment or repurchase.

This means that even if you are looking at long term gains the investors as a group have no incentive to buy the growth stock, because the dividend stocks will outperform the growth stock in terms of value extracted for 25 years (at minimum assuming 20%v10% growth consistent and 1%vs5% yield for growth vs divided)

And that is assuming that said growth stock can grow 150x IPO value (compared to 4x for dividend) in 25 years which is extremely rare... not to mention investors as a group operating at a loss for at least 18 years.(assuming “growth” stock actually coughs up a 1% yield 10 years in)

It’s worse if you assume investors reinvested dividends meaning that the growth stock does not exceed the performance of the dividend stock for at least 50 years and needs to increase in value by a factor of 8000x while the dividend stock only needs to grow 100x it’s ipo value..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock market high Serious non political question here...how can the Dow and others be doing so well, but unemployment and uncertainty being just as high if not record highs?

Ive invested into PLTR pretty heavily recently, at least by my standards: bought about 500 [shares@27](mailto:shares@27). I want to hold these for the long term (at least until Jun 2021) but my dad (boomer) has 30 years of market experience and has sketched me out about a few things such as:

1. market is too good right now, wont last long. it could go back to "normal" any minute and if i diamond hand it could backfire.
2. End of year the market usually crashes a bit because people take profits
3. Most importantly, the election uncertainty with the Supreme Courts and the inauguration, and whatever happens if either the Left or Right wins/loses, there will be conflict either way. And in the event of a civil war, the markets could crash. Maybe not, since election day uncertainty just rose the markets more.

From my understanding, there is a "short squeeze". Could someone please explain (with reliable sources) what is happening ?

"A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price."

"KEY TAKEAWAYS

* A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short-sellers bail out to cut their losses.
* Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.
* Both short-sellers and contrarians are making risky moves. A wise investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock."

PLTR is probably one of the hottest and most discussed stocks right now and has only recently declined slightly because of investor Citron claiming to short it expecting a price dip down to 20 by the end of the year.

I've been holding carnival cruise (CCL and CUK) since late-April, with all of my gains coming this month, so I am now up 62%!


On the horizon I see a lot of potential positive news, with the vaccine rollout starting any day now, relaxed restrictions over the next couple months, and potential for a high amount of revenge travel (which should mean a high amount of bookings, leading to a large amount of hype). 


At this point I am thinking about just holding Carnival until May, when hopefully things start to seriously ramp up again for cruise stocks, so I can ride a large part of the recovery and to pay long term instead of short term capital gains taxes (I would need like an 18% return to make up for the difference, so I will probably hold).


What do you think about the road for recovery stocks? I think they might be appealing since they are some of the only sectors not hitting ATHs right now, and there is a pretty clear pitch. On the flip side, many have loaded up on debt, and with some stocks (like cruises) already stagnating before COVID, there really isn't as much of a long-term appeal with them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are people calling for the GME squeeze just now?

After all that time isn’t it a little fair to question if the squeeze may have already passed?

Is my balance updated at the end of each trading day, meaning the next days earnings/losses are calculated based on the closing balance on the previous day?
