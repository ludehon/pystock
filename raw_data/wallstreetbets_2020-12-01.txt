 Diamond hands on Chinese EVs The Senate Bill and its likely passing is a GOOD thing for Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto.

It's a good thing for these Chinese companies to have robust regulations. It will make their numbers shine that much more!

Just fucken google the Li One, or the Xpeng P7. They're fucking beautiful products. 

Great, let's get US accounting and auditors to stamp their mark of approval on the numbers. That's literally all the proposed bill is doing. That's not scary.

The market has already factored and priced the Bill in. So im not selling.

Fuck the haters. Believe in the product. Biden isn't far away. This is a dumb republican senator's proposed bill to protect american auto makers whom are dragging the chain in the market. Little does he know this is gonna fuck the industry more when Nio proves its market cap does belong in the top 5 for autos with numbers certified by US firms.

Position: longing the fuck out of NIO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I The Only One Out There? Can't Be NIO and Xpeng Just keep fucking going downwards. I don't understand when am I going to see a Major Green day for them. Unbelievable

PLTR 40c 5/21/21_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A message to the paper-handed sissies and üåàüêª Dear paper-handed sissies & üåàüêª,

If I‚Äôve learned anything after losing 5k since February, it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt lose until you sell. 90% of the trades that I fumbled, due to being a paper-handed retard, mooned soon thereafter. 

If you didn‚Äôt notice in the past couple of weeks prior to this slow ‚Äúsell off‚Äù of GME, PLTR, and a handful of others these last few days, there was a large amount of bullish sentiment surrounding these stonks and you more than likely got AT LEAST 1-2 nice trades off before this ball draining decline (if you didn‚Äôt FOMO entirely too late). A large number of the bearish posts were being downvoted to oblivion or deleted by shit mods. Weird right. (Insert bull trap) 

Now, if you look at the recent posts regarding these same stonk handles, there‚Äôs a growing number of bearish fucktards saying things like ‚ÄúPLTR $10 EOY‚Äù & ‚ÄúGME going back to $5‚Äù. ü§° The shorts are getting theirs during this time and are taking what they came for before the inevitable occurs with all of these (our testicles dragging across the moon, Mars, your mom‚Äôs chin, what have you üöÄüöÄüöÄ). This is our time to shine. You heard it hear first. (Insert bear trap)

TL;DR - Don‚Äôt go against your senses and go all gay bear on us ... we‚Äôre holding strong and retail is about to overtake institutional. Don‚Äôt go too short on your calls but be sure to lock in these free tendies. üìà

GME $25+ EOY. 
PLTR $35+ EOY.

\- Roughly 10% more stocks are hitting all-time highs than all-time lows

\-  Stocks have outperformed bonds by 10.69% during the last 20 trading days. This indicates investors are rotating out of safer bonds and into equity.

\- Volume for put options has lagged volume in call options by 67.78% in the past week, indicating extreme greed as investors make bullish bets on stocks.

\- The McClellan Volume Summation Index is at the upper-end of its range for the last 2 years.

\- S and p 500 chart showing unsustainable hyperbolic growth and is currently 9.46% above its 125-day average.

\- The government no longer bailing out the stock market. This new decision pulls $455 BILLION DOLLARS away from the Federal Reserve, it ends several key loan programs from functioning after December 31.    
 

For the first time this year, I am bearish. Mark my words: this rally will end in tears!

I'm ready to buy in. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let's Talk Cannabis Do people really think that weed is gonna suddenly attract new markets? If you don't smoke weed now, you won't smoke it just because it's legal. Maybe you're inclined to try it, but it won't attract long-term new market share; it will only take customer base from the black market. This would just crush lower income communities that, I hate to say, thrive off of the drug industry. 

Taxes are proposed at 5% for 2 years with an increase of 1% each year until it hits 8%. (Just 5 years) The customer will directly eat those costs. You can get an 8th of weed on the street for 30$ but you'll be lucky to find legal cannabis under 50$ an 8th. 

The only people set to win from this, if it even happens, are wealthy potheads. Theres a reason drug dealers are drug dealers, it is PROFITABLE. Legalizing the industry and taxing it an absurd rate may decrease arrests, but will increase poverty in the same communities it aims to heal. Government intervention will just hurt the bottom line and drive the cannabis industry into the ground.

Legalization and retroactive expungement is one thing, but you will now just throw these individuals into a worse cycle of poverty. I just ask that you try to understand the implications of the MORE Act.

I called my brokerage firms customer service number to find out what it meant.

Nio is looking extremely bullish in 2-5 years, a forecast of $300 is not unlikely. This is not "long term" in stock terms at all.

For the past few weeks, there has been increasing attention and hype thrown towards Bill Ackman and his SPAC, PSTH over rumours of a Stripe merger. Although no deal has been confirmed, what's interesting is Chris and Dave from Dumb Money jumping into the speculation. Who are they you may ask?

A trio comprised of Jordan McClain, Chris Camillo and Dave Hanson, these guys claim to have turned 30k to 30M via clever uses of margin and *social arbitrage*. ***That's right, these guys spend hours every day analyzing conversational data from Twitter, Instagram. Google Trends, TikTok and Reddit just to find the next big trend.***

[https://youtu.be/UCGah3spmjs?t=263](https://youtu.be/UCGah3spmjs?t=263)

&#x200B;

For example, once Apex Legends came out, these guys went hard on EA call options, **gaining a 2.5x return.**

These guys have been riding PTON and TSLA since their lows in March. Not only that, these guys are dead serious about their trades, investing up to **100k for a "low conviction trade",** **100k-200k for a "medium conviction trade" and 250k-1M for a "high conviction trade".**

[https://youtu.be/UCGah3spmjs?t=435](https://youtu.be/UCGah3spmjs?t=435)

That brings us to PSTH. Dave have recently stated on their [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/MGET78M) that they have both him and Chris have each bought 10000 shares of PSTH. Assuming their orders went through at about \~$24.4, this means that they each spent **$244000** on PSTH shares, which means that this is a **medium to high conviction level trade for them.** Their play on PSTH is nothing to scoff at.

Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by **many automakers** to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of **self-driving**. The combined company will retain the name Luminar Technologies Inc. and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol "LAZR‚Äù. Since the announcement in august, GMHI stock is up 38%, bringing the mkt cap to $1.7 Bln. The deal should be completed by Q1 2021 and the merge pro forma implied enterprise value of approximately $2.9 Bln and a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 Bln, so today we are trying to understand if there‚Äôs more room for tendies after the *bullish bonanza* of the previous week.

**Gentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention**

There are some serious players behind this deal so let‚Äôs break them down:The deal includes $400 million of cash from Gores Metropoulos, whose founder is a private equity professional, $200 million financing by investors including tech billionaire **Peter Thiel** (PayPal, Palantir), GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman, Volvo Cars Tech Fund and VectoIQ, the firm that helped Nikola Corp go public through a SPAC.

Not only, they have a long list of clients who are all willing to pay big bucks to get their hands on sensors as soon as 2022.

**Ehy but w8 a sec, I can see NIO there but no TESLA, WHERE‚ÄôS MUSK DADDY?!?...Why Tesla Won‚Äôt Use LIDAR**

*Let me quote the greatest absolute madman of our century: LIDAR is a fool‚Äôs errand‚Ä¶ and anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed.*  
LIDARS are expensive and prone to be damaged, also not very smart in recognizing object, that‚Äôs why Musk has opted for the proprietary VISION software which enables TESLA cams to understand the surrounding environment instead of shooting stupid lazer beams. Surely a great approach but right now their technology has a gap to bridge as they stated in one of their last meetings. Whether they will succeed or not isn‚Äôt really important for a company which aims to get on the market hopefully sooner than them. Obviously, companies such as Daimler and Volvo (which historically sold **safety** as their key selling point)  would be very happy to sell AD4 cars by 2022.  


**Ok but why tf should I buy shares of a company founded by a 17 years old dropout?** 

Surely there are many companies working on similar projects such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Aurora, which aim to reach level 5 of autonomous driving (fully autonomous), but Luminar hits a different market. With a more modest target of hitting level 4 of autonomous driving, Luminar focuses on long-distance vision, key for highway driving. Yet, this is also a crowded market since players like Velodyne and others exist. Well not so crowded maybe, Velodyne has lost clients in the last year, it had Ford but they partnered with Luminar...they had Weymo (Google) but they went for their own road just as Tesla. Not to mention that Velodyne sensors have a crazy price at $25K.

**Since this is a DD post, I will not get into the technical details of why their technology has** ***some*** **breakthroughs, but let‚Äôs break down some more numbers**

We don‚Äôt have balance sheets so we will have to rely on their presentation (which is where all the images come from btw). They expect 90% of future revenue coming from their 50+ already signed partnerships, and with a 50% + margin, selling both hardware **AND** software, this could be a great company to invest in (or just go for quick tendies who am I to judge). 

https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=16d5769f3da85b8b7bdc4074a38b04348d8c7860

You can check further technical details about their technology and implementation on their presentation but the last figures I want to concentrate on is the following: as of 2020 there is no other LIDAR long-vision competitor, also their price tag is about $1000 for the IRIS sensor, which is 25 times cheaper than its closest competitor. This could really scale up quickly if the outsourcing production process is handled correctly, which by the way will take place in Thailand and Mexico.

DO NOT PAPER HANDS._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thanks, Unity! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Was Shkreli from the future? Martin Shkreli famously bought a company on the verge of bankruptcy (KaloBios) and became its CEO. The stock rocketed 800% on the news and destroyed short sellers and forced them to beg for money on gofundme. https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/20/investing/trader-gofundme-drug-kalobios-shkreli/

Back then when asked why he was interested in KaloBios he said he was significantly focused on a specific one of their assets, Lenzilumab. A drug he believed was very promising and underdeveloped. 

Well Shkreli was forced out of the company and made to sell his shares due to his ongoing legal issues - eventually landing him in jail where he remains today.

In the unlikely event that it doesn't go to zero, the old equity holders collectively can expect to own a low single digit percentage of the new equity.

The Bears in shambles, scrambled to cover, the shorts were overbought.

Among his ranks a cry went up, the Bears were in retreat.

So into the gap the Bull horde rushed, to clinch the Bear defeat.

And as the Bulls pursued the Bears, a grim truth became clear:

The Bears were not retreating, they were not fleeing in fear.

The trap was sprung, the Bulls exposed, the Bears did circle in.

The paper-handed fell in droves, their will was much too thin.

Then in the distance, a clarion call, a bugle sounded out.

A cry was heard, ‚ÄúRALLY TO ME, WE CAN REVERSE THIS ROUTE!‚Äù

Upon a white horse, sitting tall, a figure could be seen.

Ryan Cohen rides into the fray, swinging his mighty Peen.

‚ÄúA TENDER OFFER! A PARTNERSHIP! E-COMMERCE OF GREAT RENOWN!‚Äù

And as he bellows his battle cry, the Bears are stricken down.

Bruised and bloodied, the Bulls regroup around their mighty king.

A knot of Bulls in a sea of Bears, the Bears begin to sing:

‚ÄúGME IS OVERBOUGHT, BnM IS DEAD‚Äù

‚ÄúJOIN US BULLS, SHOW PAPER HANDS,SAVE YOUR FOOLISH HEADS‚Äù

And as the Bears advance in waves the stricken Bulls reply:

‚ÄúYOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS, GME‚Äôs A BUY!‚Äù

And as the Bears fall on the Bulls, the shield wall does hold.

As waves upon the shore they break upon the Bulls most bold.

Wave by wave the Bears attack and wave by wave they fall.

With hands of diamond the Bulls push back, Bear corpses form a wall.

The Bulls ascend onto the wall, it‚Äôs here they‚Äôll make their stand.

And as they gaze upon the field Bear corpses dot the land.

And in the eyes of the Bears they see pride give way to dread.

A moment of stillness, the Bears shy back, the Bulls then push ahead.

With Ryan Cohen in the lead the mighty Bulls march on.

‚ÄúYOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS!‚Äù the field rings with their song.

Now tasting fear, the Bears lose heart and start to melt away.

The Bulls push forward, the battle won, they‚Äôll dine on tendies this day.

The Bulls still standing, with hollow eyes, watch their foe retreat.

They weigh the cost of their victory; the tendies oh-so sweet.

On December 11, S&P will announce which company is getting the boot from the index. This is a huge put opportunity! 

Market cap requirements for S&P500 today are $5.5 billion so our list should include companies that fell below that number. Market cap was the main reason Macy's was removed.

Next we look at profitability and look at companies that show negative net income.

This leaves us with a few candidates mostly in energy space, replacing TSLA with an oil company can also be symbolic:

**NOV** - National-Oilwell - Mkt. Cap 4,760,117 and net income -6,095.00 M

**DXC** - Dxc Technology Company - Mkt. Cap 5,574,167 and net income -5,369.00 M

**HAL** - Halliburton Company - Mkt. Cap 14,665,676 and net income -1,131.00 M

**OXY** - Occidental Petroleum - Mkt. Cap 14,675,854 and net income -667.00 M

**APA** - Apache Corp - Mkt. Cap 4,865,692 and net income -3,553.00 M


These are the 6 candidates I got puts on, they are pretty affordable too.

I often see posts asking about how new investors should can get into options, asking what the benefit to calls/puts are, etc...

Who am I/What do I do? I'm a fellow autist, but I'm also a licensed portfolio manager and I work for an investment firm that shall remain nameless. I don't trade on their behalf, so I'm free to do whatever I want on my own portfolio. 

&#x200B;

When buying a call (or a put), you're effectively buying the right to purchase a stock at a set price.  
With a call, you are paying someone for the right to buy their shares at a specific price. This is called the **Strike price**. Your contract also has an expiry date. If the stock is below the strike price on/before the expiry, your option expires worthless, and your maximum loss is the amount of money you paid for the contract.  
If the stock is above the strike price on/before the expiry, you can either sell the contract, or hold onto it with the hope of it continueing to go up. At expiry, if the contract is "in the money" (profitable), then you have the right to exercise this contract and buy the shares for the strike price.

  
Your call option has several things incorporated in it for the price you pay.

1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.

2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)

3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price

4) The supply/demand factor.

&#x200B;

Let's use real-life examples:  
You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.

Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.

If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]  
If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]

December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.  
Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.  
Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.  
However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.

If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.  
Your upside however, is unlimited.  
If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.  
So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).  
At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.  


The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.  


If you're right on the direction and the timing of your bet, you can make a lot of money.

If you're wrong, this acts as a way to minimize your losses.

With the popularity of tiktok and its format that seems very much here to stay, this is a bigg play for WMT. It opens up a new world of possibilities with e-commerce beyond just tapping into revenue on one of the most used social media services.

This deal doesn‚Äôt HAVE to get done. But will most likely get done considering what‚Äôs on the line for everyone involved. They‚Äôve already extended the date once and are unlikely to get any more time.

WMT has been extremely aggressive about expanding their business and entering new markets. This is just the first result of a years long effort to compete with the likes of amazon and other large caps with diversified revenue streams.

I imagine that once this deal is settled, and before the end of the year, they will also release numbers on Walmart+ which is rumored to have collected an impressive amount of subscribers thus far.

As SaaS companies continue to report earnings over the rest of this week and next (SUMO reports 12/7), I think SUMO will see several significant upgrades from analysts, especially as its business is better in a Covid-free world and company guidance should reflect increased optimism.

I came up with a simple strategy that has been working every time. Very simple, all that‚Äôs needed is patience and big nuts. Also assuming we are all autistic here.

Strategy-

Pick a stock you think will go up

Buy option on that stock a little OTM and 6 months out. 

Set a price target ( mine is 150% )

If stock goes up right away and gets to 150% I will cash out. 

If stock goes down right away I hold and check back every week. 




Do not get caught up in the day to day movements. Zoom out to the 6 month or 1 year chart or do not look at markets daily, end of every week is good.

Very simple, but effective. Just gotta be ok with bag-holding for a couple months if you have too.

Right now we are just entering THE GOOD PART OF THE CYCLE.

Last time we were in the good cycle, Micron had a EPS of 13 dollars on a share price of 50. Yes the PE ratio was 4. WSB bought the peak in droves and Micron never went past the low 60s. (rip Martymoho)

Now Micron is again in the 60s ready to take off, because now is the START of the memory cycle. Not the peak, the start.

EPS of 13? Micron will reach an EPS of 20 this cycle and it will last longer than last time.

After seeing numerous posts of some pretty wild and crazy charts the past few months, congrats to those of you have won the lottery by the way, I decided to offer this PSA to those of you who want to "do it right" moving forward.  A few users on here are already doing this and I promise the sooner you act like them the better.

Also, some of you may have stumbled upon my earlier post: [New Category Needed: Tax Bill Porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ikus0l/new_category_needed_tax_bill_porn/) and I am already popping my popcorn to wait for the wreckage.  

**TLDR: Who will benefit from this... anybody that is currently trading stocks/options/etc in a non-IRA account.**

Okay you millennials and slows (I'm looking at you Robinhood users), here is some free advice as my Xmas gift to you.  It's free so you are guaranteed to get your money's worth if not more.

**Qualified vs Non-Qualified Accounts:** Let's start with the basics here and this entire write-up will be basic.... there are essentially two types of account that you can open and trade in called "qualified" and "non-qualified" accounts.  Qualified accounts mean there are tax advantages to using this type of structure and non-qualified means there are no tax advantages per se.  Disadvantages will be covered in a moment but let's stay here for just a minute.  When you trade inside of a qualified account and grow your money (called "capital gains" in bog boy/girl speak) you are allowed to DEFER taxes owed on that growth until waaaaaaay far down the line.  How far you ask??  Until you're 59.5 years old or beyond (currently).  Trading a non-qualified account, however, has no tax deferral advantage and therefore you owe taxes NOW on that money (at current income tax rate if your gain occurred in less than 12 months and at a lower rate if your gain occurred in over 12 months).

&#x200B;

>Example: You started 2020 with an account value of $0 and after making a deposit or two, YOLO'ing your money into retarded OTM options that hit, kept doing the same and kept hitting, rinse repeat rinse repeat rinse repeat etc etc, and on December 31, 2020 you now have 5X what you started with, or 10X, or 100X, doesn't really matter, NOW YOU HAVE CAPITAL GAINS AND NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE CREATED A TAXABLE EVENT, and potentially a very big one.

If you made all those short term trades inside of a non-qualified account, which I'm guessing might be the case for many users here, you may owe big and candidly I can't wait to see the posts popping up in Feb/March/April 2021.

If you made those short term trades inside of a qualified account, however, you owe NOTHING today.  That is right, ZERO.  In the future you will pay taxes on that but the future is not known and the future rules are not known either so who cares.  It's a wozy it's a woozy it's not on the elemental chart.  Are you with me??

**Advantages of Tax Deferral:**  If you followed me this far you are probably wondering, "But dude, there is no way Uncle Sam is letting me skate without paying taxes, right?!?" and you are half right.  Uncle Sam is not giving you a free pass but rather he (or she, I want to be PC here since these are sensitive times) is allowing you to pay taxes at some point in the future when you begin to use the wealth you have accumulated for a purpose he feels is appropriate like funding your retirement.  Why?  Probably because he knows social security won't cover all your costs and probably because some lobbyist think tanks convinced Congress to do some stuff decades ago that is helping you now.  All you need to know is that by using a qualified account to be trading in you can turn Uncle Sam into your wife's boyfriend's personal bitch boy and there is nothing he/she/them can do about it.

**Disadvantages of Tax Deferral:** I feel it is worth highlighting two noteworthy disadvantages to trading within a qualified account because they're important.  First, once you place your money into the account you have somewhat "locked" it there for many years to come.  It can grow, it can shrink, or it can stay the same size (insert giggling here) but you cannot access the funds until age 59.5 or after (under current rules) without incurring penalties AND taxes owed on the gains, assuming you have them.  Second, there is a limit to how much you're allowed to put into qualified accounts every year because even though Uncle Sam is willing to temporarily get down on his knees and felate you with tax advantages he isn't going to allow you to finish on his face.

**Limitations of Qualified "Tax Advantaged" Accounts:** Because I am trying to keep things simple here let's establish a few ground rules on limitations.  Traditional/Roth IRAs cannot have more than $6,000 contributed to them in 2020 and 2021.  Other forms of qualified accounts such as SEP IRAs, Solo 401Ks, and some others may differ but we're not going to touch those here.  There are also reasons why you'd go Traditional vs Roth, and back door Roths, and blah blah blah but we're KISS.  The important info follows instead.

If you have had gains for 2020 so far (ie you bought something at $X and sold it at more than $X) then you can't do anything about the taxes you'll owe on that now.  But you can get really smart in the next month and open a NEW account and fund it (with up to $6K) so that moving forward any gains will be taxed VERY differently.  And, after Jan 1, 2021 you can add another $6K (if you have it) so that 31 days from now you can start the YOLO cycle all over again with $12,000 and ALL gains will be taxed a loooong time from now for many people here, as long as you can get by without accessing those funds until a loooooong time from now.

**So What? Too Long, Didn't Even Read The TLDR:** So what is the following... Some of us have had great years and that is awesome.  In case you didn't make the most of this gift for 2020 you (presumably) have many more years with which to take this info and run with it.  Most experienced/older investors have numerous accounts, both qualified and non-qualified.  Strategically they likely base trades and plays in different accounts for different reasons (ie if you plan to hold an investment for more or less than 12 months), and you should too.  A few users on here with huge accounts have even flexed this recently and I encourage all of you to flood them with PMs asking them which type of account you should open. (jk)

But if you've read this far and you haven't already started researching the difference between IRA account types and rules and regulations then I promise you it will in fact be YOU playing the role of beta cuck to your wife's boyfriend's uncle come April 2021.  In truth I hope that at least a few people read this and benefit from it and I hope that in 2021 we can celebrate more gains AND no taxes!!!

Well, not really, but the first doses of vaccines will be administered to healthcare and other frontline workers by the end of the month. As production on these vaccines are being ramped up to the tune of billions of doses through 2021, demand for the materials needed to make them is as high as it can be. Basically, these raw materials will be gone as fast as they can be produced.



That‚Äôs where our hero, Avantor, steps in. They‚Äôre working in conjunction with Operation Warp Speed to supply most of the 208 vaccine programs with the materials necessary to produce their vaccines. With over 200 manufacturing/distribution/sales centers in 30 countries, Avantor is poised to absolutely skyrocket as production ramps up.



In an interview with Bloomberg last week, CEO of Avantor Mike Stubblefield said he sees this being a $4-5B market that they stand to be THE major player in. And with the unprecedented situation Covid has caused, he could see it potentially being as large as $8-9B. 



They spent all of Q2 and Q3 focusing on hiring enough manpower and acquiring enough production materials to be ready as soon as they get the call. 



18/20 analysts currently have given $AVTR a buy rating. Stubblefield is scheduled to speak at the HealthCONx conference at 2:40EST tomorrow.

**Summary**

* As speculators circle around Palantir from both the long and short sides, trading volatility has obscured the fundamental picture as to whether the company commands a sustainable competitive advantage.
* In this article, I intend to have an under-the-hood look at Palantir as a 'digital resources' play to answer that all-important question.
* I believe its Gotham, bundled with forward-deployed field service representatives, has surmounted the barriers to entry and now enjoys switching cost advantage and emerging network effect.
* As it diversifies into adjacent commercial verticals through Foundry, Palantir will benefit from economies of scope and scale. Profits will ensue.
* Shareholders are betting on Palantir's success in completing the digging of a wide moat. The less anticipatory investors may want to wait until such a moat becomes reality.

**Palantir Technologies: Does It Have A Sustainable Competitive Advantage?**

There are probably as many investors who are averse to Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a recent public listing, as those who root for it. The stock has gone parabolic since the start of November 2020. Then, short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research entered the scene with his tweet. All of the trading volatility has obscured one important fundamental question: does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?

Below, I attempt to answer that question with an in-depth look at this interesting company.

**What does Palantir do?**

As of 2020, Palantir's mission is to help its users, the people doing the hard work on complex, real-world problems by writing software that enables effective analysis against complicated, data-driven problems.

Palantir offers two principal data fusion platforms for integrating, managing, and securing any kind of data at a massive scale, i.e., Gotham for government agencies and Foundry for the commercial market. With forwarded-deployed Field Service Representatives, Palantir transforms massive amounts of disparate information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations, and layer applications on top of the Gotham or Foundry platform to make the integrated data asset accessible and actionable and for fully interactive, human-driven, machine-assisted analysis (Fig. 1).

On the backend, Palantir runs a system called Apollo as a continuous, automated means to deliver updates to the Foundry and Gotham platforms everywhere they are deployed - cloud, on-premises, and classified networks - without disrupting customer operations. Apollo reduces the demand for field engineering teams to manage software deployments and gives Palantir SaaS operating efficiency in a very heterogeneous environment.

Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires not only to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.

There is a range of potential competitors that offer similar services in some capacity, including (1) traditional IT consultancies, e.g., Booz Allen (BAH) and Accenture (ACN), which lack the technical prowess as well as niche focus; (2) blue-chip data companies, e.g., IBM/i2 (IBM), which cannot scale down efficiently enough to compete on price; and (3) defense contractors such as Booz Allen (BAH), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and BAE Systems plc (OTCPK:BAESF), which cannot compete on costs and end-user responsiveness with Palantir. These juggernauts are not nimble enough to pivot away from their legacies and wide-ranging service offerings to effectively match the focus and end-user friendliness of Palantir, although they may occasionally chip away some revenue.

Silicon Valley heavyweights, such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), are unwilling to work for the Pentagon citing unethically even though it thought it was okay to collaborate with the Chinese government in project Dragonfly (see here).

There are some smaller start-ups that work in the same general field as Palantir, but they lack the resources (capital and talent) to climb the steep learning curve and compete against Palantir head-to-head. These may include Digital Reasoning, which entered the intelligence field even before Palantir and also received funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, which seems not to be particularly well run which is why its founder recently returned to the CEO helms; (2) Ayasdi, acquired by the SymphonyAI Group in 2019, which has a core topological analysis platform on top of which custom applications for customers mostly in healthcare and finance are built; and Beijing-based MiningLamp, self-styling as "the Palantir of China" and with US$300 million just raised in a funding round co-led by Temasek and Tencent, which may pose some threat in the commercial arena given it reportedly got business from western firms (see here).

With regard to the OS platform for data especially on the government front, Palantir more or less owns the niche. On the commercial front, Palantir is industry agnostic but is focused on forging ties with approximately 6,000 companies in the world with more than $500 million in annual revenue. Palantir has been saying the real competition is the in-house development projects of its potential customers.

**The digital resources space**

I believe some of the key characteristics of Palantir can be better understood in the context of what I call the "digital resources" investment space at The Natural Resources Hub (Table 1). This is a group of businesses from various industries, which in a nutshell share the following features:

A unique value proposition. By accumulating and processing big data, or enabling data-intensive operations, these B2B companies generate recurring, subscription-based revenue from business or government customers.

Wide moat. They command a monopolistic or oligarchic position in their niche, protected by enormous barriers to entry, some network effects, and switching costs, which gives them a sustainable competitive advantage over the fellow industry participants they serve. They tend to show resilience during industry crises.

Dominance in native industry. They are deeply entrenched in their respective native industries. Some of them were even bankrolled at their birth by home industry advocacy groups. They then expand into adjacent industries in pursuit of economies of scope.

Aggressive acquisitions. In an expansion of their service into adjacent verticals, they usually face a fragmented competitive landscape, fertile for M&A, which further fuels rapid growth.

Capital and operational efficiency. They develop scalable solutions that are built once and installable or sellable countless times. So, they are capital-light and can operate very efficiently. They typically generate superior profitability and deliver a high rate of returns on invested capital.

As I shall demonstrate below, Palantir shares most, if not all, of the characteristics of the verified members of the 'digital resources" space. Prima facie, it is a wide moat prospect and worth a deeper examination.

In the consumer-oriented internet arena, winners are known to take all thanks to a number of traits, including the economies of scale and scope, network effects, the advantage of big data and machine learning, brand power, switching costs, the attraction of talents, the charisma of hard-driving founders, and benefits of geographical clustering, as has been summarized here.

The same may not be said about the B2B platform race, where peers compete mainly on products, services, and customer experience (see here). The outcome of the competition may not be binary (the winner takes all, and the losers die) due to the lack of viral growth.

**The technological edge**

As I stated above, B2B platform rivals compete primarily on products, services, and customer experience. Palantir follows the approach of bundling superior technology with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.

In its home industry - intelligence and defense, Gotham was created with native attention to security rules, access privilege, and user action logging. No other systems allow users to draw associations between disparate data sets and to visualize the connections as easily and quickly. Palantir has maintained a laser-sharp focus on developing the world's best platform for data, while its primary competitors such as Booz Allen or Raytheon are widely diversified. From competition outcome to reputation among end-users, Palantir not only has a clear technological edge but also is more cost-effective than competitors (see here and here). That's why Palantir is confident it only needs to be placed in front of the right people to prove its worth.

But then, what makes Gotham shine are the forward-deployed field service representatives. Palantir field service representatives proved to be not only some of the brightest engineers known to government agencies but also extremely responsive to the needs of end-users. These forwarded-deployed engineers examine customer needs, resolve all data source and complexity issues, and build out applications on top of Gotham. Once the applications are built, they train users on site until the customers are ready to use the product on their own. The forwarded-deployed engineers also bring their experience acquired in the reality of deployment back to Palantir development centers as they rotate assignments.

Although its technology and approach are by no means cannot be replicated, Palantir makes the smart decision of focusing on a narrow scope in the sprawling B2B data landscape and, in that niche, it excels at helping customers solving complex data problems at relatively low costs, which actually takes a lot to accomplish, from well-written software, via responsive backend support, to knowledgeable forward-deployed field service representatives. It is no wonder Palantir has earned a sterling reputation for effectiveness and ease of use in the intelligence and defense circle, which I believe it can parlay into the commercial market (Fig. 2).

**Palantir brand and talent attraction**

Given the forwarded-deployed engineers play such an important role in the technological advantage of Palantir (as do the backend developers), it follows that it is critical for it to attract the smartest engineers in the market if that edge is to be maintained and expanded. To that end, the founders have successfully created an aura of mystery around Palantir:

In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, being its very first investor; catcher of Osama bin Laden and the would-be preventer of 9/11; buster of the hacker of Dalai Lama's personal computer and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff;

software vendor to a slew of U.S. intelligence and military agencies (including the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, Special Operations, the Marine Corps, the U.S. Army and West Point, the U.S. Navy, the USAF, and the U.S. Space Force), police departments like NYPD, the governments of U.S. allies, and commercial businesses Ferrari (RACE), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), BP (BP), Merck (MRK), and JP Morgan (JPM);

helper of the NIH, CDC, and NHS to track the COVID-19 virus, the World Food Program to stop famine, and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to fight child exploitation;

high-profile politicians such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet advising, while luminaries Mike Kelly, David MacNaughton, Louis Mosley (grandson of Oswald Mosley), and Fabrice Br√©gier (former No. 2 at Airbus) joining to lead its Australian, Canadian, British, and French subsidiaries, respectively;

a dissent in Silicon Valley that takes side with the U.S.A.; let alone the persona of the hard-driving founders, including Peter Thiel who is said to be the smartest guy in the Silicon Valley besides being a co-founder of PayPal (EBAY) and the first outside investor in Facebook (FB), the lawyer-philosopher-hedge fund manager CEO Alex Karp, and the genius engineers Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings; even Shyam Shankar, the COO, has also been getting a lot of attention...

The mystique proves to be a powerful recruiting advantage; it helps line up a self-replenishing stream of the best applicants from some of the top-ranked colleges and graduate schools, who are confident they are the smartest computer geeks, who join to work long hours with a cultish band of fellow geniuses to solve the world's hardest problems in spite of lower salaries than Silicon Valley juggernauts like Google, Facebook, and Apple (AAPL).

Becoming a publicly-traded company only strengthens the staffing edge, thus posing a serious challenge for the big IT consultancies, traditional defense contractors, and smaller start-ups. Hiring the best talents will undoubtedly help sustain Palantir's technological advantage.

**High barriers to entry**

There exist extremely high barriers to entry in the intelligence and defense sector. Even the best end-user experience and reputation alone are not enough to get deals closed. Below, I highlight two hurdles.

Just to open doors. To open doors and lubricate negotiations, some major defense contractors spend as much as $14 million per year on lobbying.

Palantir had been quick in learning the rope of getting things done in Washington D.C. It consulted Washington insiders early on and went ahead hiring former senators John Braux and Trent Lott for formal lobbying (see here). Its lobbying spending has been on a steady rise and, in the last few years, reached well over $1 million per year by hiring >25 lobbyists (Fig. 3).

Palantir also retained former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet as advisers (see here).

To overcome buyer inertia gently and forcefully. Another major challenge faced by Palantir was the department of defense saw it as an outsider that tries to sell software not even in response to any specific requests in its conventional acquisition system, oblivious to the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of Palantir Gotham.

In response, Palantir allowed free trials of Gotham and provided free services before potential military clients made any purchases; it offered free or reduced-price training to military units that purchased its software. Forward-deployed field service representatives listened to the needs of its end-users and were capable of implementing requested changes quickly.

Palantir's entrepreneurial approach led to a number of successes with, e.g., some Army military intelligence units and the Marine Corps. Some intelligence officials in the Marine Corps even went so far as to say they would not be surprised to see Palantir remain the de facto standard (see here).

Even though Palantir has demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Gotham, the U.S. Army stuck to the plan of developing its internal intelligence software suite, i.e., the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Increment 2, and released a procurement solicitation in December 2015 for its development, thus effectively excluding the ready-to-deploy commercial alternative - Gotham - from being considered. The Army decision was a major blow to Palantir because Gotham does exactly what DCGS-A is trying to do yet at a much lower cost; in other words, the Army is reinventing the wheel, unnecessarily and wastefully.

After a pre-award bid protest filed with the Government Accountability Office had been denied, Palantir sued the Army in the Court of Federal Claims in June 2016, arguing the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act by not conducting the market research necessary to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs, with or without modification. The lawsuit is an extremely bold move because defense contractors typically dared not to sue its largest customer, even when their interest as protected by the 1994 law had been infringed. The judge ruled in favor of Palantir in October 2016 and upheld Palantir‚Äôs argument the Army violated the 1994 law (see here), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7, 2018.

Even while the appeal was ongoing, the Army rethought its acquisition plan and, in March 2018, picked Raytheon and Palantir to provide new intelligence analysis platform offerings that could be used effectively at the tactical level in place of DGCS-A. In March 2019, the Army announced Gotham beat out Raytheon's FoXTEN system and won the $20 million first delivery order, as part of an $876 million contract over 10 years. Significantly, the Army's loss in court forced it to transform its procurement process. The Army now follows a ‚Äútry, buy, decide approach‚Äù when it comes to commercially available products (see here). The win in the court is expected to create a lot of opportunities for Palantir down the road.

The distance Palantir has gone to gain access to the intelligence and military market proves one thing: the presence of enormous barriers to entry. In the face of such formidable hurdles, few aspirants have the determination, investment time horizon, and resources to pull off the feat of entering and establishing itself as the de facto standard in that market. Over a time span of 15+ years, Palantir sunk quite a few billions of VC dollars on software development, offering products and services for free or on lean fees, and lobbying and suing to get a level playing field, yet without a single major botch-up over all those years. Those who sneer at Palantir for still losing money after 17 years of investment fail to appreciate how impossible a strategic goal the company has come to set for itself: to become a wide-moat software supplier to the governments of the U.S. and its allies.

**Switching cost, economies of scale, and network effect**

Having earned contracts from the intelligence and defense sector, Palantir became an insider so to speak, and the barriers to entry work to its advantage. Gotham has been deployed as the platform for data integration at various intelligence and military units displacing the existing system including DGCS-A, a myriad of applications has been developed for the agents, and thousands of end-users have been trained to use those applications on a tactical level in critical missions and battlefields. A switching cost has arisen in favor of Palantir and it will only get higher.

As more contracts are signed with the U.S. government and its allies, Palantir will begin to enjoy economies of scale, thanks to the large fixed costs incurred for building the software once and the relatively low costs associated with deploying it countless times.

Just playing out according to Palantir's plan, Gotham is increasingly being used for sharing disparate data sets across different government agencies. Once those siloed data sets are all integrated on Gotham, there will emerge a huge network effect, further heightening the existing barriers to entry. Under such a network effect, a new entrant may land an isolated deal sporadically, but it is beyond me how this hypothetical incursor can dislodge Palantir by convincing dozens of stodgy government agencies to simultaneously give up perfectly-functional, mission-critical Gotham and install an unproven piece of software instead. That's why I believe Palantir's competitive advantage in the government sector will prove to be sustainable.

**The commercial market**

As I discussed above, 'digital resources' companies tend to expand into adjacent verticals for the benefit of economies of scope. Palantir's expansion into various industries in the commercial sector is precisely for that end. The same technological know-how sharpened in defense deployments can be parlayed into serving the commercial sector. The utilization of Apollo, the backend system for continuous, automated software update deployment, doubles as it supports Foundry in addition to Gotham. The corporate resources are shared by operations in both sectors, resulting in lower overhead per dollar of revenue. The direct sales force will be able to cross-sell Gotham to some commercial customers. Diversification into additional industries reduces the risk associated with the slowdown of individual industries. As opposed to the high barriers to entry in its home industry of intelligence and defense, the commercial world tends to have more competitors. However, economies of scope will likely offset the narrower moat.

**Network effect in the commercial sector**

Over the long term, Palantir (PLTR) estimates the total addressable commercial market contains \~6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue (see here). Palantir began to develop Foundry for the commercial sector in 2012 and launched it in 2016. Foundry is poised to become a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. In 2017, e.g., the five-year, $300 million partnership with Airbus allowed Foundry to expand into a platform for the aviation industry, which today connects data from >100 airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.

If successful, an industry-wide central operating system for data will effectuate an extensive network effect. However, to get there, Palantir needs to rapidly grow the commercial top-line. Foundry pulled in $340 million in 2018 and $397 million in 2019. Commercial revenue grew 35% from the 3Q2019 to the same period one year ago (see here). How will Palantir further accelerate commercial sales momentum?

**Commercial sales strategies to accelerate the network effect**

In the near term, Palantir plans to focus on building partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations - to reconstitute their operations around data. Buy-in from the top brass is imperative. Hopefully, Palantir can leverage its reputation and relationships gained in the government sector, as in an early case in which NYPD, then a customer, introduced Palantir to its first commercial client JP Morgan (JPM).

Palantir used to have a policy of not hiring direct salespeople, given how intelligence and military contracts are acquired and serviced and perhaps due to a post-dotcom bubble belief "technology is primarily about product development, not distribution". However, there is absolutely no viral growth in B2B as there occasionally is in B2C. The common practice in the 'digital resources' space is to maintain a large force of salespeople each managing a few customer accounts, with responsibilities such as opening new sales territory, scouting for client needs, scaling within existing customer accounts, coordinating technical presentations by engineers, securing technical support for clients, and managing customer relationships. Palantir began to recruit direct salespeople in end-2018. The commercial sales growth in 2019 seems to prove the concept of direct sales works, so Palantir is poised to triple the headcount of the sales force.

Historically, data-inundated organizations either build in-house or buy dozens of off-the-shelf products and sew them together, both approaches having been proven inefficacious in a rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain world. Foundry offers the third, and better, option for those organizations. However, Palantir comes to realize that, in the near-term, institutions do have an imperative to stick to their internally-built software. So, Palantir makes its own solutions fully modular such that customers can "take what they need, build on what they have" (see here). Such a flexible approach should help overcome corporate inertia to reach out for external assistance and accelerate customer onboarding, and create a new way of going to market with channel partners.

Palantir plans to partner with cloud-hosting channel partners, such as Amazon (AMZN), to drive commercial revenue growth. It was Amazon that helped facilitate the partnership between Palantir and the Colombian government. Palantir developed Visor COVID-19, a digital instrument built on top of Foundry hosted in the AWS infrastructure and offering a unified, near real-time view of the state of the pandemic using the largest integration of open data and depersonalized epidemiological data in Colombia.

International sales already account for fo 46% of the total revenue as of the 3Q2020. As part of its international growth plan, Palantir has set up subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, and other countries in the last few years. In Japan, it took a different approach and chose to form a joint venture in partnership with Sompo Holdings, Inc., which subsequently invested $500 million in Palantir. The JV launched in June 2020 ‚Äúthe real data platform for security, health, and wellbeing‚Äù, powered by Foundry, to accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese governmental institutions and industries ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing. The JV is also working on onboarding the Japanese government.

**Risk abounds**

Public relation disasters can damage its image in the eyes of the next generation of software engineers; this is an area that Palantir, now a public company, should allocate additional resources to. A Snowden-like incident can set Palantir back appreciably, impacting client relationships and employee morale alike.

Palantir must penetrate its chosen market swiftly to enlarge the switching cost, expand the network effect, and heighten barriers to entry, lest a resourceful competitor launches a dogged challenge in the government sector or its smaller imitators strike it lucky in the commercial market and steal potential customers. A well-intended acquisition can turn sour, contaminating the entire operation.

As far as I can see, the management team at Palantir is paranoid enough to allow any blind spots unaddressed in its business execution. However, Black swans do happen.

**Investor takeaways**

I believe Palantir has an inchoate durable competitive advantage, which acts as an economic moat to protect its business from invaders, which seems to be widening judging from new developments since the IPO.

In the self-created niche of supplying the operating systems for data for government agencies, Palantir clearly delivers a peerless customer experience with superior technology bundled with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.

Gotham has become the default operating system for data at some U.S. government agencies, where Palantir enjoys switching costs.

Palantir seems to have also built a brand that helps attract top-notch talents, which sustains its technological edge.

Now that it has kicked open the door of the U.S. government agencies by winning a critical lawsuit against the Army, Palantir is expected to achieve rapid penetration of that market. Gotham is increasingly being used for integrating siloed data sets across different government agencies, which in time will result in an enormous network effect, further heightening the barriers to entry for aspirant entrants.

The company is aggressively diversifying into adjacent commercial verticals and international markets for economies of scope. Revenue growth, both from the government and commercial sectors, will lead to economies of scale. Down the road, Palantir will have the pricing power at its disposal to drive profitability.

At this time, the share price of Palantir may seem to have gotten ahead of itself - a point to be further explored elsewhere. The shareholders are taking risks to bet that the company will succeed in digging the wide moat and that years of profitable growth will follow.

Less anticipatory investors may want to wait until Palantir has completed building such a wide moat. For these investors, the entry opportunity may come in the form of a major sell-off during a general market recession or in an idiosyncratic crisis down the road.

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a "cap" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.

Dynatrace provides cloud-based, AI-driven observability. For us retards, that means they do big software shit that sounds cool.

**Why invest in DT?**

DT is like the Tesla of observability; they started out by targeting a niche market of high end customers. They primarily look at 1B+ revenue customers, and they've got an ARR of ~230k for ~2500 of those. Thing is, the number of 1B+ rev companies that are within DT's target demographic is more like 15k, so they're only 17% penetrated right now.

**Little Competition**

The other big player in the space
 is New Relic, but they're focused on much smaller businesses. Cisco is another competitor but they're laughably smaller. DT currently has ~70% of the F500 on its platforms. 

**Expectations**

The average price target for DT is $49 and the high is $59, so there's plenty of room to get some sweet tendies here. COVID has only sped things up because companies have to transition to the cloud and DT offers both legacy and cloud solutions. DT is also pretty undervalued relative to its peers in the DevOps space with a multiple of 19. We all know DevOps is the next major tech subsector and DT looks like it'll be leading the charge in the observability space.

Reminder of The Rise and Fall of MartyMoho I reproduce https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eaujdv/the_rise_and_fall_of_martymoho/

/u/MartyMoho is one of the true original gamblers of WallStreetBets.

The Legend of MartyMoho begins on March 23rd, 2017 when he posted a $1,000,000 position in Micron (MU). This was roughly 55% shares at a $26 price average, and 45% calls split between ITM and OTM.

Micron held an earnings report later that day and the results were much better than expected. Micron delivered, skyrocketing afterhours over 10%. Marty woke up the next morning up over $600,000.

What made this even more impressive is that Marty was not some ultra-rich billionaire with a highly diversified portfolio of assets. No. Micron was the only company he owned, and this was his entire portfolio.

‚ÄúAh, well, I've only owned $MU or its derivatives for almost two years. I swing traded $AMD a little fall of 2016 but essentially that's all $MU‚Äù

Marty continued to hold positions in Micron over the next year, and his account reached a peak value of $2,500,000 from his original $200,000 in September 2015. A 1200% gain.

Marty wasn‚Äôt finished though, the money, the shitposting, the endless call outs of Jim Cramer on twitter (@MartyMoho) wasn‚Äôt enough for him and in true wallstreetbets fashion, he needed more.

On March 22nd, 2018 Marty bet all $2,300,000 on $MU calls set to expire over the course of the next several months, a majority being OTM. $MU was trading at $54 that day, and his strikes were all between $50-$80.

Marty remained optimistic as $MU hovered around the same price over the next several months. But on August 30th, 2018 Marty started losing hope. On this day he made his final ever comment on reddit:

‚ÄúI don't know, I expected at least a partial run-up but it's not materializing at all. If it doesn't pop after ER like it did this time last year, I'm pretty f'd‚Äù

$MU was trading at $53 when he made that comment, theta was killing him. But it didn‚Äôt get any better for Marty. $MU fell 40% over the next few months, all the way to $30 as his calls were expiring. $2.3 million lost, as the strikes were so far out of the money that even if he had sold, it would have been too late. They were worthless.

That was the last comment Marty ever made online, his Reddit, Twitter, and Stocktwits all stopped being active between August 30th and 31st, 2018. No one knows for sure what happened to him, but the speculation remains. One thing is for certain though. As quickly as he rose, he fell, and the legend of Marty is now just that ‚Äì a legend.

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company‚Äôs future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it‚Äôs GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it‚Äôs shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it‚Äôs share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock‚Ä¶ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe‚Äôs, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna‚Äôs candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it‚Äôs head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they‚Äôre first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn‚Äôt gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

Not really a public markets guy, but I spend a ton of time in private enterprise tech.  Lately I've been deep in log management/SIEM (exciting fucking stuff) and have unearthed a big upside opportunity.  I've already placed my bets so now I'm sharing with you retards so you can pump my numbers.

tl;dr, $SUMO is about to drastically beat expectations on late released q3 earnings because the market appears to have conflated their go forward (rev growth) performance with their deepest doldrum q2 performance.

&#x200B;

1. Sumo's earnings timing has depressed value.  While almost all other enterprise sales tech have benefited from the release of their Q3 results, Sumo closes quarters a month off. We still haven't seen Sumo's Q3 and their Q3 earnings call is Dec 7
2. The market was unimpressed by Sumo at IPO because they had really slow growth in Q2, 30%.  However, lots of enterprise sales cycles were delayed in that period.  In that slow quarter, nearly 100% of that growth came from existing customers with almost no net new customers ([Meritech breaks this down](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/sumo-logic-ipo-s-1-breakdown)).  Their growth rate in Q1 and the year before was about 50%  I expect they will return to this growth rate in Q3
3. This all amounts to equity pricing that is wrong two ways: Revenue estimates are off and price multiples are off, all  due to an incorrect expected growth rate in Q3 and forward.  I could probably try to guess how far off they are and set a price target since YoY growth is close to 50% and rev multiple should be closer to 15x+, but nobody's paying me for this, and I just need my tendies to print.

This may be the beginning of an upward bullish trend for CRSR. The sharp decline of the stock price was nothing more than profit taking. The company itself, Corsair Gaming, continues to be a leader in the Gaming industry with "The new guidance implies revenue growth of 50%-52% compared to last year". Corsair is profitable year after year even beating the first estimated earnings by 0.25, which is more than double the expected.

"Corsair‚Äôs CEO Andy Paul stated, ‚ÄúIn our Gaming and Creator segment, we continue to see strong sales in all price points, which we believe indicates that we have both new customers buying gear as well as existing customers refreshing and upgrading".

12/18C at $45_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nikola put your hands up and walk to us. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Corsair Going Up More... A lot More New computer parts like Graphics cards and CPU‚Äôs are selling out immediately and selling for a lot higher than their retail price on the secondary market. This is something the Gaming PC space has not seen at this level before and it shows just how high the demand is for gaming PC‚Äôs right now. Stocks like AMD and Nvidia might seem like the best stocks to buy because it‚Äôs their parts that are selling out selling out. However they are such big companies and we wont see their prices go to the moon. While I do recommend buying AMD because of their recent leaps in CPU dominance over intel, their new  gaming GPU (6900XT) that is faster than Nvidia for the first time in years (and for 2/3 the price no less) and the fact that they make the Silicon for both the PS5 and new Xbox. I would not expect AMD to moon just became of Christmas Sales, it‚Äôs more of a long term play. However With this new spotlight on the PC gaming market, Corsair should see a massive increase in revenue. If you know anything about PC gaming you know the name Corsair. I for one own multiple Corsair products and am very happy with them, which is why I bought Corsair at IPO a few months ago. All kids want this year is Consoles and Gaming PC‚Äôs and even professionals have started investing more money into the PC space because they are on their computers all day due to the pandemic. All this crazy demand around the PC space 100% helps Corsair. They are a huge player in the PC market and they make everything from custom water cooling parts for PC enthusiasts to headsets for console gamers. Corsair also owns El Gato. El Gato makes products such as screen capture cards and webcams, things that have seen a huge increase in sales during the pandemic due to their usefulness in online meetings. All this combined makes Corsair a necessary stock to own this Christmas Season._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JP Morgan Chase Pymetrics Results JP is looking for I was told by JP Morgan Chase recruiter and videos that I‚Äôve seen on JP Morgan that is listing somewhere online what results they are looking for as in what skills are looking for each particular position.

Nike has been making all kinds of moves lately. They're not just a sportswear company anymore. Like Lululemon, they broke on through to the other side. They are a lifestyle brand. They are stay-at-home comfort. They are socially progressive, culturally relevant, and swaggy af.

Above all though, they provide the best e-commerce user experience out of all their peers. My family never shops only, but we browsed Adidas, Puma, Reebok, New Balance, and Nike for hours yesterday. We up ended dropping thousands of greenbacks on Nike. Big fat zero on everyone else. Adidas, likely the competitor-in-chief, has BY FAR the worst e-commerce interface of the lot.

So buy Nike. That is all. Earnings on 12/18 will be a blowout.

Abbott Laboratories is easy money. They make 5 minute covid testing strips, and have a government contract. Back in August they announced a $750 million contract with US government.
https://www.biospace.com/article/abbott-wins-750-million-contract-with-u-s-government-for-rapid-covid-19-test-/

With Biden in office, he wants to make testing more available and free to everyone, thats where Abbott comes in. They already have a government contract, and so things are only looking up for ABT. They had a low of $62 stock price on the year and it is currently $108 and climbing. Im not taking this as a yolo with weekly calls, Im going long because I am a pussy and going long with Jan 20, 2023 120 calls. They are sitting around $12 a call now and no way the stock doesn't go up in the next two years. Its free money. 

You might ask oh there is a vaccine coming, that will stop testing. Wrong. Not everyone is going to rush out and get the vaccine, and even if they do, schools, government etc will still make testing necessary and take precautions to make sure they aren't spreading covid. 

Thats not all, they are also helping out with diabetes among many other things, so the future of the company is bright.

This morning a co-worker noticed I was looking at stocks. He asked what I was in. Then slowly others came over. I was asked why I dont cash out my gains

Let¬¥s gooo üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What I learned from half year of investing (and trading) Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.

TL;DR: Stonks don't always go up. Get your emotions in line, especially jealousy of people posting their 1000+% gain porn. pre-market is a bitch. do your DD and don't just buy highly upvoted tickers. good money can be made in safer plays as well (like buying Shopify when it dropped to 900 due to vaccine news.). PLTR & NIO TO THE MOON.

1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.
2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. 
3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.
4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.
5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.
6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.
7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.

I know all this is just a repeat of some obvious things everyone says and my post may just get removed. Who cares.

Another thing: my experience here is just from stocks and not from options. I am from India and it is illegal for us to trade options in US market. 

Finally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.

"The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border.

Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of "a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers".

The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general.

The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information."

Mood: üöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Gold [$GLD] _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME Price Action, Short Raids, and You In the last two weeks, the stock pumped at open, slowly died throughout the day and then it dumped harder in the last few minutes most of the times.

But now, it always closes green. 
On higher than average volume.

‚ñ∂ What does it mean?

üöÄ Bulls are winning

üöÄ Big players aren't selling the shares they loaded up at $10-$13. Bullish

üöÄ It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close

 If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt

Weekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.

‚ñ∂ Q3 earnings expectations?

üöÄ If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.

üöÄ If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.

The earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.

That said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.¬† "Worst" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices. 
That's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.

‚ñ∂ When do I cash out?

Realistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.

üöÄ The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs

üöÄ No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me

That said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through earnings, for once.

Alright retards here me out as I give a quick dd on AvePoint/ Apex Technologies and why it could be a potential rocket ship to Mars. I haven‚Äôt seen any dd posts recently so consider this a reminder and don‚Äôt get caught sleeping. 

For those that haven‚Äôt heard, the private company AvePoint and the public SPAC Apex Technologies agreed to a reverse merger last week that will become official by Q1 2021, most likely by the end of January or beginning of February. 

So, what is AvePoint? AvePoint was founded in 2001 and is a partner of Microsoft. They work in management, protection, and storage of data for Microsoft office 365. (I know you retards apparently love data companies like PLTR so this is right up your alley).

AvePoint has strong business relations with Microsoft and has won Microsoft company of the year 5 of a possible 19 times and the Microsoft VP sits on the board of directors for AvePoint. They also have some legitimate leadership with one of their co-founders being the former CFO of Oracle and the other co-founder being the former head of tech investing at Goldman Sachs. 

On top of that their financials are pretty phenomenal as they have no outstanding debt, 250 million in cash reserves, are profitable, and have been growing in revenue steadily YoY. They are projected to grow roughly 40% in revenue by 2022 too, as they are seeing huge upticks in demand as businesses around the globe are continually transitioning to cloud services and moving their businesses online. 

AvePoint will be priced at a $2 billion valuation once the merger is official and they go public.  

For comparison one of their main competitors, Snowflake, is valued at about 90 billion, while having about only twice the current revenue of AvePoint‚Äôs. 

Hypothetically, if AvePoint were to become half the value of Snowflake based on revenues, it would be worth more than 20x what it will be at the time it goes public. 

Not saying it‚Äôs going to become worth 45 billion but we could see it balloon to 20 billion+ easily, which would still be about 15x what it is now. 

Lastly, they currently do not have calls but as the merger date gets closer, options will be added so you idiots can blow up your accounts on FDs. 

TL;DR Buy apex Technologies and be prepared for the rocket ride.

A Lovely Poster by the name of deltalake had an abundance of different pieces of information that he speculated may be evidence that $PSTH was looking at a minority acquisition in STRIPE. His main post and points can be found below. My thoughts come after his. 

 

üöÄüöÄüöÄ **DD - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd ($PSTH)** üöÄüöÄüöÄ

In recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman‚Äôs blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \~10-20% position in the company and taking it public.

This can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Information/Timeline of Events:**

\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH ‚Äì the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B making it the biggest SPAC ever.

\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the "tontine" name - look it up, pretty cool.

\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn‚Äôt get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside.

\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.

\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.

\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.

**- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:**

o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC

o Square executive joins board of PSTH

o **Seth Klarman** ($30B hedge fund manager ‚Äúthe next Buffet‚Äù and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).

o **Guuggenheim** buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares

o **Warren Buffet** has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards other financials? With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.

o Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.

o There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman‚Äôs.

o In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly **9%** for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.

o The most cited (and really only) example of why this won't be Stripe is some troll that one of the brothers made on twitter. If they are indeed in negotiations, or getting ready to re-present to PSTH given all their new hiring, and given PSTH work in securing top of the line investors (**Klarman, Guggenheim, Blackstone, Ontario Teacher's Union**), this wouldn't be a bad negotiation tactic. They know the PSTH offer must come with some concessions.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ends his post, now lets take a look at his points one by one that are relevant to STRIPE.

1. Stripe is a quality company but one that is not yet ready to go public. How is this conjecture even mildly relevant to him hinting at a possible stripe acquisition? He said himself that he is looking for a mature company, and Bill himself believes that Free Cash Flow is number one when looking into a company. Stripe does not fit this bill.
2. Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next google. That's great, and? There are a plethora of upcoming tech companies, seemingly more everyday, that are being praised as the next google. Praising a company as good and comparing it to a titan which it is not similar too in almost any way is not relevant for the point that is trying to be made. 
3. Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money. He has publicly disclosed that he has made mistakes missing companies that make money in a manner similar to this in the past. SEVERAL TIMES. Why do you believe he won't do it again?

4 and 5. o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with   
focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC and a Square executive joins board of PSTH, These   
are the only two points that I believe hold any interesting merit at all. 

6. Seth Klarman has a large position in the company. This is great. It has nothing to do with stripe.   
The entire tontine warrant structure absolutely reeks of value due to it incentivizing holding   
through merger in order to claim warrant fractionals. Seth Klarman is a value investor. This is the   
only deduction you and honestly, and reasonably make.

7. Guuggenheim has millions of shares, as well as the ontario pension board. Now why would these   
two buy? First of all, you can't make any reasonable attributions to stripe, there are no links.   
Guuggenheim holds most of these shares in their  Guggenheim Fds Tr-Guggenheim Total Return   
Bond Fund. A BOND FUND. Why? Because these SPAC shares almost act like a zero coupon bond,   
the same reason the pension board likely owns them. If worse comes to worse, they can redeem   
their shares for 20 dollars at merger date, but most likely higher than that the way spacs   
perform.  

8. Warren Buffet slashed his JPM and has an undisclosed stake. There is also a large portion of   
undisclosed PSTH. We don't know the size of Warren's missing investment. We also know this is   
not really up his alley, so if these are linked it's an investment by Ted or Todd. The missing shares   
could be more than a single holder as well. 

9. In recent days stonk go up. What does this have to do with stripe?

&#x200B;

TLDR- Bill Ackman followed some stripe people on twitter so apparently PSTH his going to be acquiring a portion of stripe. Please convince me otherwise, because I would love to invest in Stripe.

It represents a range of (usually) plus or minus 2 standard deviations above a moving average, which is (usually) set at 20 periods. You probably don't care about that because I know that none of you can do statistics anyway, but you should. Why? It basically indicates is that **95% of the time, significant movement outside of the bands is not going to last**. This is incredibly useful for timing entry points and exit points throughout the day.

What I've found is that **a significant jump outside of the range created by the Bollinger bands is usually followed by a reversal, allowing you to maximize your profits** on exit by selling at a peak or on entry by buying at a trough. Let's use everyone's favorite meme stock of the week as an example. Focus on the examples circled in white for now.

[PLTR, the morning of 11\/30, 1-minute candlestick graph with Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf8a85fc29173930ba5e0b9632a5b5f42cc77a2c)

In each of the pairs of white circles, there is significant movement outside of the bands and relatively high volume, which is followed by either a retracement or a reversal. The first and last pairs show the stock price extending more significantly beyond the Bollinger bands for longer periods of time, along with relatively higher volume than the middle two examples. Here, the first and last pairs are reversals, while the middle two pairs are retracements. **The stronger the signals, the more likely it is to be a legitimate reversal instead of a retracement**. If you want to, you can combine this with other indicators like RSI if you know what you're doing, but volume is a pretty good indicator of signal strength on its own.

On the other hand, if the stock price steadily hugs one of the bands, it usually indicates a legitimate trend. You can use this to hop on an uptrend if you're buying, or to cut your losses if you're selling. The magenta example shows a clear downtrend. Note that the stock price hugs the lower band, never falling significantly below it. It's accompanied by relatively high volume, so you know that the signal is strong.

I've only been trading for 7 months, but I've been doing much better since I've started paying attention to these indicators. I pretty much only use the 1-minute graph with this, although it can likely be applied to other relatively short periods too. I'm not saying this will let you see every reversal before it happens like some sort of psychic, but it's a hell of a lot better than flying blind. Start using them, you can thank me later.

Right now $PEN is facing lots of legal trouble due to their Xtra Flex catheter killing and injuring several people. This summer it was announced that they will be facing lots of legal issues from this. Also, late this summer the company's CEO/President sold around $1.5 million worth of $PEN stock. You're probably thinking "why the fuck has penumbra jumped up $100 since summer if all that shit happened", honestly I don't know either, but recently a lot more people are finding out about whats happening and after hedge fund manager Gabriel Grego brought up that $PEN is going to shit its been a red day every day for the stock. It will definitely drop lower.

Oh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.

-----

I‚Äôm back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze‚Äôs results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*

It‚Äôs currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.

**GME Overview:**

The GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we‚Äôve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. 

In all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I‚Äôve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID ‚ÄúHell is coming‚Äù bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.

Just a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB‚Äôs name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord hosted by u/BadElf21 and u/RoaringKitty‚Äôs YT stream).

Let‚Äôs begin.

**Act 1 - The Set Up:**

Q: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren‚Äôt they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?

A: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.

First let‚Äôs go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:

* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.

* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.

* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.

* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.

The shorts are betting on $0. 

However, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody‚Äôs they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).

So give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.

That explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they‚Äôre all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.

In case the severity of the short interest hasn‚Äôt hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. 

A true head-scratcher. 

And a worthy opponent.

But they‚Äôre wrong.

**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**

Q: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn‚Äôt this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? 

Couldn‚Äôt the shorts be right? Also, hasn‚Äôt it blown already?

A: NO AGAIN.

Let me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:

**1) Ryan Cohen**

Iron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.

This guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.

In other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He‚Äôs as crazy and as smart as they come.

He also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he‚Äôs not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He‚Äôs setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). 

Either way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.

Otherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)‚Äôs ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.

One more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. 


**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**


Dr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: 

- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000

- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000

- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000


Hestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.


Cpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he‚Äôs doing.


Reggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.


**3) Bond repurchase**
	
GME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.

Secondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody‚Äôs to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.

This is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.

Very underplayed story here.


**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**

> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. 

> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from ‚Äì mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).

> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.
Compare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily ‚Äì figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME‚Äôs cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it‚Äôs African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don‚Äôt be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.
The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn‚Äôt just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. 

> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn‚Äôt going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.
So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for existing short positions.

JeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don‚Äôt agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.



**5) Product Mix**

GameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that‚Äôs the narrative.

GIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.

**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**

This is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.

Instead, think of any other market bubble. It‚Äôs simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).

So instead, think of Burry‚Äôs 2008 MBS trade, Ackman‚Äôs 2020 COVID trade, PTJ‚Äôs Black Monday Trade, or Chanos‚Äô Enron trade. 

Same thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.

And oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.


**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn‚Äôt that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody‚Äôs credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don‚Äôt know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).‚Äù

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn‚Äôt even be considered an euphoric price with today‚Äôs growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here‚Äôs my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

-------

If I missed anything, comment and I will update above. I‚Äôm aiming to make this the final stop for all high-level GME DD.

*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.

This post was removed previously and you guys are hilarious_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Popular WSB Opinions During Any Stocks Lifetime _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Calculating what the GME price should be for shorters to get in the red Assumptions:

A person/institution borrows N shares from a broker at time t=0, at the price of P\_0 per share, and with the interest rate r. Equivalently, the shorter has borrowed N\*P\_0 dollars.

The person/institution can cover the short position (buy back the shares and return them to the broker)  after T periods at the price of P\_T, and make a gross profit (not considering the costs of borrowing) of N(P\_0 -  P\_T)

The costs to the shorter: interest paid + opportunity cost of what could have been done with the money (let's say buying an index ETF with an R% annual return is a relatively safe alternative).

So in the end, the shorter makes a loss if:

gains < costs

N \* (P\_0 - P\_T) < N \* P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Cancel out N from both sides:

(P\_0 - P\_T) < P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Let's give our parameters numbers. If the shorter started their position in Nov 2015 (5 years ago, so T=5) when the price of GME was $40 per share, with an interest rate of r = 5% per year and the opportunity cost (the return on an index fund) being R = 4%, solve for P\_T

40 - P\_T < 40 \* \[(1 + 0.05 + 0.04)\^5 - 1\]

40 - P\_T < 40 \* 0.54

40 - P\_T < 21.5

P\_T > 18.5

So for this shorter who started its position at such a high price ($40) 5 years ago, the price should go above $18.5 to get them in the red.

This could explain why they fought so hard to keep the price below $18 today.

1. Declining macro environment ‚òëÔ∏è - GME is a brick and mortar retailer in the age of e-commerce whose demise was nearly certain before COVID-19, and then COVID-19 accelerated the process. 
2. Rapidly declining revenue ‚òëÔ∏è -  YoY quarterly revenue growth has been negative for past 5 quarters.
3. Business model not becoming more efficient in digital era ‚òëÔ∏è - Gross margin has steadied around 28% since 2018.
4. "Smart money" betting against the stock ‚òëÔ∏è - Hedge funds actively betting against GME's survival with short % of float at 297.3% (as of Nov 13).

In the face of a dismal macro environment and worsening company fundamentals, you retards of WSB have bucked any sort of common sense and relied on each other to squeeze Wall Street's nuts and sent GME to levels not seen since late 2017. In the process, WSB has funneled $s upon $s from top Wall Street hedge funds, minted several millionaires, and multiplied many more retards' net worth. Embodiment of Robinhood in its finest form. As an innocent bystander, I fear for the future of some of your portfolios, but I get that "as long as the music playing, you've got to get up and dance." I just hope you've distanced yourself from the punchbowl and are eyeing the exit. Til the break of dawn yo!

Assuming constant gross margin of 28%, flatlined SG&A and impairment costs, and a forward P/E multiple of 8x (courtesy of ahminus), to maintain it's current valuation of $16/share, it would have to grow revs YoY at roughly 100%... pretty ambitious considering we can all agree this is not a growth tech company.

Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Won‚Äôt be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide.

Look for AMD to trade in the 90-96 range tomorrow. It shouldn't go any lower than 89 ish IMO. Anything lower than 87 ish and AMD will fall to 86-83.

AMD Plays for 12/1:

* If AMD holds support on its uptrend channel at around 92.16 you could scalp a 94c 12/4. Trim and leave a runner for 96+.
* If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish. If it breaks at 93.51 ish, then expect a drop to 90.59 ish. If it breaks at around 95 ish, then expect a drop to 91 ish.
* 89p, 90p, 91p 12/4 will be the plays, depending on where or if AMD drops out of its uptrend channel.
* Trim and leave runner at price target or bottoms. I don't think we drop lower than 87.18 tomorrow, but leave a runner for the lotto in case we do.

TSLA Plays for 12/1:

* I'm expecting TSLA to close around 605-617 ish so keep the 620c 12/11 that I told you to buy.
* If TSLA holds current support, look for 605c 12/4. Trim at the target or at top and leave a runner for 617+
* The line in the sand is really 593.43 IMO.
* TSLA could bounce off 605 ish if it makes it and drop to 588 ish and below. Scalping a 585p or 580p might be worthwhile. Trim and leave a runner for 576 ish and below.
* If current support fails, look for 588, 580, and 576 price targets. It TSLA breaks through 576.90 ish then expect it to fall near 552 ish IMO. 552 ish is danger zone for TSLA so be careful if it gets there.

Ever use Google earth? Chances are you have used one of Maxar‚Äôs satellites to view images of the Earth. 

This company creates satellites and satellite-software for global Earth imaging. Recently, they have taken on several contracts with the US Government, specifically the state department, for homeland security. 

Maxar has been doing serious balance-sheet strengthening and significant improvements to the way they create value. Recently, they have been paying out a dividend, although small at .01, it shows that the balance sheet is strong from a sustainable flow of cash. Net income has also been on the rise. The PE ratio is very low, coming in at around 5. Having a market cap of 1.7B I see plenty of room for growth in the share price, and it seems investors are undermining this company‚Äôs future potential.

Maxar is also a great acquisition target. Lockheed, Raytheon and even Boeing could be possible contenders for a Maxar acquisition.

GME share price has been increasing steadily for the past few months. Every Release of a new console rapidly increases the price per share of GME such as in 2007 with the release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and in 2013 with the release of the PS4 and Xbox 1, in both scenarios, the share price capped in the low 40's before falling back into the normal range. Before both of these "console induced" surges the price per share was $11 just check out this graph: 

[GME the last 20 years showing a surge of both console releases.](https://preview.redd.it/zhna7ifxjh261.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f82684f1e1f3e94ac1bb9b36373755589ecfd90)

As seen in this stock price history graph price per share drops dramatically a couple of months after each console release. This is just beginning with GME today. THE SHORT TO FLOAT PERCENTAGE OF GME AS OF RIGHT NOW IS 292.53% this is very important. Starting very soon there could be a short squeeze. Since the number of people short selling this stock is insanely high in today's market, there is a very good possibility of a short squeeze. As I said at the start share prices have been rising making short-sellers nervous, as the price increases due to the "console induced" surge (and other factors ill link later), the more short sellers will buy back their losses since they are at an infinite risk for loss of money. Since this is likely to cause all of the short sellers to buy back their shorts the insane 292.53% short to float ratio will come into play, this is what will cause the short squeeze... AS THE SHORT SELLERS BUY BACK IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RAISE THE PRICE PER SHARE CAUSING A MASSIVE GAIN IN PROFIT. this is very likely to be way higher than the previous $40 per share cap as seen in the last console surges. This is why a short squeeze is likely and this is why there are millions of more shares owned than on Friday's market close. This is only the start gentlemen and watch as this phenomenon plays out.

Here is the link for more info on the GME situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme\_full\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme_full_story/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I winning yet? V3 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 10 Brown tips for WSB Newbies Reading   through some of the posts I can see how some of you think so highly of yourselves that a single red day in a rocket ship stock market makes you feel like you're the next Warren Burry. Post after post  of losers making huge returns.  Everyone is getting rich but you.  Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor  realizes it‚Äôs all an elaborate side  stepping of online casino laws. Some of it works, most of it doesn‚Äôt. To be successful, you need to be able to recognize the difference and to  do that, you need hype, lots of money, and a cushy day job to fall back  on when you blow up your life savings on a YOLO.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

**Tip 1 - You don‚Äôt know shit**

But that's fine, because nobody else does either.

**Tip 2 - Understand how tendies flow in the market**

Tendies flow to those bold enough to earn them. If volatile stocks and speculative "investing" scare you, go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and park your money in an ETF.

**Tip 3 - Play for the short term**

The   most important rule you need to follow religiously is ALL COMPANIES  WILL EVENTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. If you look at the makeup of the  market from 1995 to now, you'll notice a glaring trend: 90% of companies  that were at the peak of the market then are now dust. You may get  lucky and pick a long term winner here and there, but understand that  hype is a bitch, there's always a bigger fish, and nothing lasts  forever. If you're not planning your bets with well defined entry and  exit points, you will end up diamond handing some losing play way too  long because your confirmation bias has convinced you that you found the  next Amazon in a sea of [pets.com](https://pets.com/)  stocks from a DD post on a forum that is self described as "if 4chan  found a bloomberg terminal". Picking individual stocks is for short term  gains. Park your money in an ETF or index fund if you want something  long term with an OK rate of return.

**Tip 4 - Time is not on your side (if you're yolo'ing options)**

Theta  gang always wins. They don't always win as big as others win, but they  always win. If you're trading short term options and you're not the one  benefiting from theta, don't be so greedy that you lose your profits to  theta decay and market volatility. A stock could end on a Friday just  barely OTM and ruin your account just to run up 20% the following Monday.

**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**

Paper  trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with  real active data but it‚Äôs all practice. DO THIS FOR ZERO SECONDS. Paper  trading to prepare for real trading is like a boxer only training for a  fight by hitting the heavy bag. It will help some, but it's nothing like  a real fight. Every person who says "oh if only i had bought Apple 20 years ago I'd be a billionaire" has never actually traded  anything risky because everyone who has knows that it's stupid to stare  at a 100% return or even a 20% return and not lock it in.

**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**

Plug that stuff in to turbotax and let the nerds figure this out for you.  Just remember that after each trade you make that actually earns money,  set aside some for Uncle Sam. But google "wash sale" if you get bored  between staring at futures and reading "DD" posts about chinese EV  startups.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

You don't know shit. I don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. Why are you reading this?

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

Lol jk. If you're reading about company fundamentals, go park your  money in an index fund or ETF. Refer to tips 1, 3, and 7 for why this is  the right move.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for winners**

Refer  to tip 8. You're not here to try to guess which company will be the  next Amazon by 2050. You're hear to scalp sick gains and retire early.  If you're not shooting for at least a 3-5% monthly growth in your  portfolio, skip the hassle and park your money in an ETF or index fund.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like   anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it and  be incredibly lucky in being at the right place and right time. Be  disciplined in your entry and exit points for each play, but don't over  think shit.

\--

For   those of you this resonates with, I look forward to seeing the loss  porn on the next red market day. Do the  work. For those of you  who love chasing the fantasy of actually knowing what you're  doing, good luck, I  mean it. It‚Äôs a tough fucking pill to swallow  realizing that you're not some investing prodigy and that your hundreds  of hours of "DD" will woefully underperform the mouth breathers who hit a  couple of lucky plays and never have to work again in their lives.

Positions-None_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Believe it or not, you retards know what you're doing (Sort of) Hey investors. I'm a 17-year-old senior in high school who used to watch videos on dropshipping and making money as a teenager practically 24/7. Stocks have become one of the most interesting things I've ever laid my eyes on and at about 15ish, and  I started to look into them right away. I watched countless random youtube videos trying to explain the stock market, and me being the clueless teen I am I had absolutely no idea wtf these random lines and charts meant and how they work.

Still haven't officially touched the market yet, but definitely going to soon. I've always been too afraid to lose my 1000 or so dollars I have saved up due to a bad market play. Luckily for me, my school has an Investing club. It's a group of 30 kids who are put into 5 groups and we are all doing a Stock Simulator on investopedia.com. Everyone starts with a million dollars and you make your plays whenever you want. The groups meet once a week and "discuss" what stocks to play and stuff like that. No discussion is really done because we're all awkward lazy teenagers who just care about weed and PS4 and so on.

Then I discovered you idiots.

Since the beginning of September, I've been looking through and asking questions in the Daily Thread section. You guys obviously would always have mixed opinions on certain stocks, but I would pretty much just continue scrolling through the thread until I was convinced to do a play. I've also been constantly looking at the Hot DDs that are usually right below the Daily Discussion thread, and when I'm bored I sometimes go onto a completely different website to check out a different type of Hot DDs.

Just wanted to say that I am currently in first place out of the 30 students in my class, and its not even close. I've attached pictures of the rankings as well as my trade history. You'll see that my trade history is literally just stonks that are constantly talked about in the Discussion Thread and in DDs.

Basically, if I see (Ticker)  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ multiple times in the thread, I'd buy into it.

Will I end up losing and getting last place? Possibly. But it'll only happen based on you guys - because I've practically only listened to you guys for the past few months.

So moral of the story - You guys are not as dumb as you think. r/wallstreetbets is superior to r/investing and the other boomer Reddits, but you already knew that.

I am in Europe at the moment and just a month back the Bank cards which I use to trade, deposit and withdraw have been compromised because a Hacker in Russia got my bank details and tried to transfer $10,000 and immediately my banking institution responded and informed me and suspended the cards.

After this incident I kept my banking cards for regular use separate and the trading Bank cards separate.

I am thinking about getting a separate internet connection for Entertainment purposes and another super fast connection just for trading.

I used to think that Internet has become secure as years went by, so I just want to hear how you retards, gay bears and Autists protect yourself on the internet. This is a serious question fellas, /unretard for a while and let is discuss.

40 EoW üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For all my OG TRIL holders _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [DD] GME earnings and option positioning Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.

but we ain't here to "invest" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy.

IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares)

What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.

Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

FYI, Disney+ now has nearly at 80M subscribers vs. Netflix nearing 200M (though the Mouse has only had 1+ year with DIS+ and NFLX has been here forever).

Disney is currently trading at $266B market cap on nearly $70B revenues in a COVID-year, with consensus expecting $83B in revenues next year. So 4x current year revenue and 3x next year revenue. Compare this against NFLX's $234B market cap on $25B revenues (arguably benefiting from COVID lockdowns), with consensus expecting $30B in revenues next year. So 9x current year revenue and 8x next year revenue.

In fact, Disney's DTC business generated $17B in revenue in the last twelve months! So if you apply NFLX's market cap against that revenue scale, you'd get $160B in market cap just for Disney's DTC business. **So would you pay $106B ($266B - $160B) for Disney without Disney+/Hulu/Sky?

I was overwhelmed by the response and removed the post (1) to protect from someone trading directly against me or front-running and (2) more so because I am generally a private person.

I don't expect (or hope) this post to receive the same response without the screenshots and a video showing transaction history posted yesterday but am creating it in order to provide updates.

I believe the flurry of response was due to a number of factors:

(1) PLTR is trendy these days on WSB.

(2) Screenshot from yesterday showed FMV of equity and options linked to PLTR at $8,232,909 as of market close 11/27/20. Initial response was in essence "who's retarded enough to YOLO $8M into a meme stock."

(2) Post wasn't intended as "gains porn" (actually showed a loss since most recent positions opened last Friday) but I did offer that my initial entry to PLTR was May 21 calls @ $15 opened 10/7 when stock was $10.04. 3328 contracts (cb $846,678) were sold for $2.1M. Of this, I withdrew $1M to realize a 17% gain. With other $1.1M (plus 400k from closing out of a similar PLTR position from 10/8) took increasingly more aggressive shorter dated, higher expiry OTM positions the past two weeks but moved back in longer dated contracts last Weds and Friday and opened an equity position to realize Theta and Vega gains (IV was sky high at 170% Friday).

(3) Posters said basically "well okay, you did well and locked in your profits regardless so maybe not so retarded afterall but why not invest $8M like a boomer and where did you get $8M from anyway?" FMV of the account as of 12/31/19 was $36,692.01 (I mistakenly stated 38k). 

It was almost entirely luck from Tesla calls held from Q3 earnings call last year until epic short (and gamma) squeeze following Q4 earnings call late Jan and early Feb of this year which netted tens of millions in gains and my complete exit from the market coincidentally a few weeks before the pandemic selloff. 

I reentered the markets briefly in June/July for a concentrated bet on a basket containing AAPL and interest rates futures and similarly withdrew initial investment fairy quickly and realized substantial gains over 6 weeks. I reentered the markets most recently specifically after the Palantir IPO with the company on my radar for the past decade. 

I would discourage anyone from putting their life savings in anything. But for me personally being 3/4ths in cash and real estate and 1/4th in crazy volatile options is more interesting than a ‚Äúdiversified portfolio.‚Äù

Ford has more then 2x since March lows.  I believe that because EV has been so hot lately Ford has caught a bit of the tail winds as well as they are developing cars that are also EV.  I believe they are lookinig to create a Electric F150 (but correct me if I am wrong).  I wanted to show this chart as I think it is extremely interesting on a technical Level, but also presents a pretty decent setup. 

1D: We can see that since Mid september Ford has gone on quite a run from the 6's all the way to the 9's up about 40% in this time. We can see that there is a major horizontal at 9.63 that was almots tapped last week.  I expect this area to act as huge resistance.  I am watching the 9.60 area because either way it will lead to a nice trade.  If F gets rejected here we possibly could see a pull back down into the 7 range, but a break of 9.60 could be the beginning of a new bull run.  So as I said either way I am watching. 

1D Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5WsiPfk3/

On the Below 3D chart we can see that in 2018 - 2019 the 9.60 area was major support / resistance:

This horizontal has been in play for over 33 years at this point which is pretty amazing to see.  The horizontal is older then majority of the people in MOT.  Horizontals that have been in play for so long tend to be way more important so a break or rejection of this area will likely be significant.  Overall I think its likely we see some sell pressure at 9.60, but when it does break I will be looking to buy with a decent sized position. 

Thought this was pretty interesting and worth sharing.  This is why historical trends are so important.

Also Interesting is to look at Flow Algo's Levels.  10.09 has gotten the most Volume out of any of the levels.  So 9.60 could be the break, but then watch for 10.09 for confirmation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Yolo all in apple $120c and AMD $100c, 12/31 expiry. 1 MILLION BY END OF YEAR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cybins investors Deck Someone mentioned they were having trouble finding the investors deck, I‚Äôm under the impression an updated one should be out soon but here the current :
