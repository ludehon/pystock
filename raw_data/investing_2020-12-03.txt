 Brexit, USA 2nd lockdown...where to invest? I am looking to invest some cash I currently have. I'm in the UK but with a very hard Brexit looming I'm not confident my £ will keep their value, so I thought rather to put the money into the S&P500. But what are the chances Trump pulls something and doesn't leave the White House? Or if the Coronavirus situation there causes a second and more vicious lockdown? 

Should I wait in GBP and risk Brexit destroying the buying power of my GBP, or put it into the S&P and risk a 2nd lockdown and Trump?

I know there are no right answers so I'd like to hear your thoughts. I also have some BTC btw, though I don't know if I should put more £ into it..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in tech firms. Hi everyone, I am very new in investing and also on reddit. I have some savings around 30k which I would like to invest.

I’m afraid to even mention PLTR as I imagine everyone is tired about Palantir questions but I really can’t make sense of literally hundreds of people on this forum and others believing there is a large short interest. Even $MS in their latest research report mentioned that in past weeks retail investors might have “squeezed” institutional shares. 

I’ve checked FactSet (professional subscription service used mostly by banks/institutions but fortunately I have an account) everyday and short interest remains per their data very low. For instance, SI was 34M shares today, down from 39M shares yesterday, days to cover of 0.79. 

Someone cited https://iborrowdesk.com/report/PLTR which clearly shows higher borrowing cost and fewer shares available to borrow but I don’t know where this information comes from. It states “market cap” data is from IEX. 

In short, what are people’s thoughts on FactSet (it costs $12,000 a year so would be disappointed if inaccurate!) and what is the best source to find total short interest?

One more question, as it pertains to share float does this also include RSUs and shares subject to lockup? What is the best source to find the number of shares actually available to trade daily?

Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. If you missed Part 1, you can read it [here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2020/11/30/deep-dive-1-part-1-of-2-draftkings-bringing-sports-to-life/comment-page-1/#comment-1) I’m excited to bring you the rest of my research on DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Let’s dive in.

**Can we 10X from here?**

For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.

The framework includes:

1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership
2. Risk Considerations
3. Price Considerations
4. Explosive Business Growth

**1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**

For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?

Having one founder in leadership is good, but how about three? You have to love that. These guys worked together to start this company 8 years ago, and today they hold the three highest positions within the company. Jason, Matt, and Paul were all co-workers at Vistaprint in 2012. Vistaprint is a global e-commerce company that produces physical and digital marketing products for small and micro businesses. All three of them studied computer science/engineering in college with Matt and Jason picking up an additional majors in business/economics. This makes sense as Matt and Jason are CEO and President while Paul is head of Global Technology and Product. At Vistaprint, they worked in various analytics and marketing roles and became good friends. They had a passion for fantasy sports. They liked season long fantasy sports, but saw a big opportunity in daily fantasy sports. They went to work right away on building a digital platform for daily fantasy sports from a spare bedroom in Paul’s Watertown, Massachusetts apartment. Talk about humble beginnings.

I think that Founder/CEO Jason Robins has really shown that he can take care of his baby and lead it to big wins. Over the past 8 years, he has successfully lobbied in multiple US states for legalization of DFS and sports betting. He has helped DK obtain key partnerships with major sports leagues including becoming the official DFS partner of the NFL in 2019. At the time of the deal, Jason was quoted in an article in the Legal Sports Report by Eric Ramsey as saying:

“Throughout our discussions with the League, it was evident we share a common vision around the future of fan engagement, and we are excited to continue on this unique journey with the NFL as our ‘Official Daily Fantasy Partner” and calling it “a defining moment” for the industry.

It’s very important that the CEO of a company like this, trying to essentially create a new industry in the United States, is tactful at getting deals done with key business partners and lobbying for change with the government. I believe this bodes well for DK’s future.

Also, Jason is very respected and admired by his employees. On Glassdoor, he has  a 99% approval rate. I’ve honestly never seen a CEO with an approval rating that high. I think this strongly corroborates my thesis that he is a great leader.

Also, DraftKings has very happy customers. Using Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For DK, their NPS is extremely high and is substantially better than their main competitor – FanDuel. On a scale of -100 to 100, DK has a 71 NPS, while FanDuel has a 54. This is a testament to leadership’s commitment to creating a great user experience. It really shows that company leadership can follow up on their word and deliver what they promise.

In terms of leadership, owning their company, Jason owns about 4.3% of the company worth about $880 million at the time of this writing. Fellow co-founders Matthew Kalish and Paul Liberman both own about 1.8% of the company, with their stakes each worth about $350 million. I think it’s fair to say that these guys are invested in the success of the company that they started and are motivated to grow their company’s worth for themselves and shareholders.

**2. Risk Considerations**

My investing strategy is to buy companies of high quality, that are growing at a rapid pace, and then hold my position in those companies for a long time (5, 10, 15 years or longer) as long as I continue to stay satisfied with that companies’ ability to execute their business plan and have productive quarters that meet or exceed expectations. It’s not “Buy and Hold”. It’s “Buy and Continuously Verify”. If you are going to take this strategy, you have to understand the difference between risk and volatility.

To me, risk is the possibility that I can lose my entire investment. As long as I am not trading on margin (I don’t) or short selling (I don’t) the most I can possibly lose when I buy stock in a company is 100% of my money. The risk I’m taking on is 100%. But what is my upside? Is my upside limited to 100%? Of course not. I can invest $10,000 into a company and it can grow to $100,000 (1,000%) or it can grow to $1,000,000 (10,000%). There’s really no limit. Volatility is a natural side effect of being a rapidly growing, disruptive company, that at times the public may struggle throwing a valuation on. It’s your ability to sit through these wild price swings while maintaining conviction in the company’s long term prospects that will allow you to possibly experience a 10x or maybe even a 100 Bagger.

Can we completely eliminate risk? No. But I do think there’s ways we can go about reducing it with our investments. Before considering a company for investment, I have a list of a few questions I go through to see if there’s any red flags that I think could make the investment too risky for me.

*Question 1: Is the market cap under $1B?*

No. DK’s market cap is $20.5B. Companies under $1B market cap are small/micro cap companies. Penny stocks fall in this category. To me, companies this small are riskier because they haven’t built up enough credibility to get big time financial backing, they’re less known by the public, and less scrutinized by the public than larger companies.

*Question 2: Is there one customer that accounts for over 10% of revenue?*

No. DK had 1,021,000 Monthly Unique Players (“MUPs”) during Q3 2020, which is up 64% YoY compared to Q3 2019. I seek to avoid customer concentration because if something goes wrong with that one customer or they lose them, it could have a materially negative impact on the business. Luckily, with DK we don’t have to worry about this.

*Question 3: Is the company a turnaround story that was recently struggling?*

No. DK was founded 8 years ago (2012) and has been on an upward trajectory ever since. As a matter of fact, DK was founded 3 years after FanDuel (2009) and did a great job of not only catching up to them but surpassing them on many metrics. I’ve used both and can honestly say I enjoy DK a lot more. Since they were listed on the NASDAQ on April 24, 2020 the stock is already up 160% from around $19.

*Question 4: Is the company in an industry that is set to decline?*

No. I don’t think I need to write too much about this. Ultimately, DK is a digital entertainment platform. Common sense should tell you that’s a good industry to be in right now.

**3. Price Considerations to 10x**

In this part of the framework, I want to focus on the price and the path to 10x from the current price. As of this writing (11/30/20), the market capitalization (market cap) of DK is $20.5B. For those of you that are new investors, I’ll give you a quick breakdown of what this means.

Market cap = Shares outstanding \* Price per share

So if Company X has issued 1,000,000 shares, and each share is trading at $50, the Market cap of Company X would be $50M. For reference, this would be a very small company (a micro-cap) that you or I have probably never heard of.

The market cap tells you the total value of the company as a whole on the stock market today.

To achieve 10x in 10 years, a stock will need to have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% per year on average for each of those 10 years. This would obliterate the S&P 500 which has averaged roughly 13.5% per year the past 10 years.

Now back to DK. In order for DK to 10x in 10 years from this current point ($20.5B) it will have to reach a market cap of roughly $205B by the year 2030. For reference, Disney (DIS), has a market cap of $268B as of today. Disney might be a good investment, but they’re not going to be worth $2.68 trillion dollars in the next 10 years. Size of the company matters when trying to 10x. For reference, the highest valued company in the world right now is Apple (AAPL) at $2 trillion.

Disney is considered the gold standard of the entertainment industry. But keep in mind, Disney’s position in entertainment is well established and if anything, would really be declining in the current macro environment if not for their Disney+ streaming service. Even one of the oldest leaders in entertainment like Disney realizes the value of having a digital entertainment platform. However, with the Disney story being very mature and in it’s golden years, the DK story is in the early innings. Better yet, to quote DK CEO, Jason Robbins from the Q3 earnings call, the sports betting part of DK’s business is “in spring training”. For those of you who don’t follow baseball, “spring training” means that the season has not even started yet. The entire premise of DK as a company in my mind is that they are a digital entertainment platform. With the current world macro environment including the immediate and long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe digital entertainment platforms (especially ones where you can win money) are primed for success. I know it’s a bold prediction to say a stock is going to 10x in 10 years but I believe DK does have a long enough runway for that type of growth to occur. Speaking of growth, let’s talk about that a little more.

**4. Explosive Business Growth**

We’ve talked about the path for the stock price to 10x, but a necessary ingredient for that to possibly happen is explosive growth. I like to see that top-line revenue is expected to grow at least 20% for the next five years. It’s this type of growth that makes companies that appear very expensive today, actually not as expensive as they look. Personally, when I’m evaluating a growth stock, the first thing I look at is the Price to Sales ratio (P/S). The formula for this is simple:

Price to Sales Ratio (P/S) = Market cap / Last 12 months of Revenue

For DK, the current P/S ratio is $20.5B / $550M\* = 37\*

\*To get $550M, I took Pro Forma Jan 1 – Sep 30 Revenue of $320M and added projected Q4 revenue of $230M from the Q3 earnings call.

To be fair, a P/S ratio of 37 is quite high. It means that as a shareholder, you are paying $37 for every $1 of revenue the company generates. And that’s before considering expenses. You might be saying, “Mark, that’s outrageous, why the heck would I pay $37 just to make $1 of sales?”. The answer is one word – growth. By taking a stake in DK today for the long term, you’re essentially banking on two things.

&#x200B;

1. Revenue will grow rapidly over the next few years to      make this ratio more reasonable
2. Investors in the future will still be willing to pay a      premium to have a stake in DK (maybe not a premium as high as $37 for $1      of sales, but a premium nonetheless).

In terms of explosive growth, it has been so far, so good for DK. In the most recent quarter (Q3) ending 9/30/20, revenue was $133M which is up 42% from the same quarter in the prior year. Analysts are expecting a similar trend to continue over the next five years, they forecast at least 20% growth each of the next 5 years.

If the market cap stays exactly the same as it is today ($20.5B), then the P/S ratio by the end of 2025 will be roughly 7. That is a lot more reasonable than what you see today at 37. However, the market cap is not going to be exactly $20.5B by the end of 2025. Too many things will have happened by then (hopefully mostly good things) for the company’s worth to be exactly what it is today. With all the runway for growth here, if management can execute, and actualize these impressive projected growth rates (or maybe exceed them?) I think investors will still be paying a high premium to have a stake in a company like DK.

Will investors still be paying a 37 P/S ratio five years from now? Probably not, but it’s interesting to look at what the company’s value would be if that were the case.

37 \* $2.8B sales = $104B.

I don’t think it’s realistic to think investors will still be paying that high of a premium, but maybe the premium will be somewhere between what it is today (37), and what it would be with no price change (7). This is me just speculating and guessing for fun, but lets take the mid-point of that range (22) and see where it gets us.

22 \* $2.8B sales = $62B.

This would be roughly a 300% return in 5 years under these assumptions with a CAGR of 25% per year. Not too bad! Again, take this part of the write up with a grain of salt as I am making a lot of assumptions and doing a lot of speculation here.

This concludes Part 2 of my DraftKings deep dive. Hope you enjoyed and be sure to stay tuned for the next pick and for any updates about this one!

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ While businesses recover from COVID-19, how likely is it that an over-inflated market crashes, yielding another crisis? In recent years there was a lot of talk about a possible financial crash/crisis being imminent. My guess is that no one had the foresight for what is happening now due to COVID-19. My assumption is that people were thinking about a crash/crisis more akin to the dot-com bubble or the housing bubble. With that in mind, is it not quite likely that while businesses recover from COVID-19 we get hit by another crash/crisis due to an over-inflated market? For example, tech has been skyrocketing in recent years and (aside from a short dip) it has been going further up rather than down during the pandemic?

I came across a company in August this year (I wont state the name to keep the view unbiased). The company is coming out of a long downward cycle and was at an extremely attractive valuation in August as the company has a stable business and a very positive future outlook. Even at a reserved estimation, the company stock could be a five-bagger.

I had the money to invest then, but I delayed to go all in as I was not sure how the market was going to turn out. I just invested about 5% of the maximum I can invest in the company. Till October the stock price had risen about 25% from the prices in August and I got a feeling that the market also seems to agree with me on the company's future prospects.

This is when greed took over. Considering my estimates, the October prices would still give me a 4-4.5 bagger stock. However, I thought that if I could wait till the next correction event (US election, second wave of the pandemic etc), I could still get the stock at the 5-bagger levels.

Alas, as you all know how the stock market turned out since the start of November, I missed that opportunity as well. The company stock has risen another 25% and has reduced my prospective returns to 3.5-4 bagger range.

The question I have is this: **should I wait for another correction event (greed) or should I just buy the stock at the current price and be done with it (fear), accepting that I made a blunder and lost a prospective 1.5x of my investment income?**

I know I have made a huge mistake and in hindsight should have bought the stock any time between August to October (or at least done a DCA).

An answer to put me out my misery will really be appreciated. I encourage a blunt and no-filter reply.

Edit: Thank you all for the helpful suggestions. I would like to add that I thought of doing a DCA earlier. The thing that held me back was the "perfect" price I had in my mind. But the stock never hit that price. Also, my greed kept on telling me that DCA will increase my average buying price and thus reduce my returns which I had targeted for that "perfect" price.

I have now realized that within the last 3 months I have shown all the traits why I may not be a good investor.

My wife and I just got our raises for next year ( effective April 1st, 2021) and looks like for next year we will be over the threshold of income limit of $208K to contribute to Roth IRA. We have been married since 2018 and have contributed the full amount to our Roth IRAs ($6k/each per year) for last 2 years. In addition I also have a rollover IRA ( traditional) with about $42K primarily invested in index funds. My wife doesn't have any Traditional IRAs. For her I would just do a backdoor Roth IRA from next year to continue growing tax free. 

I want to continue contributing to  IRA going forward and I am faced with three options -

1.) I can transfer funds from my existing traditional IRA into my employer sponsored 401K plan, then contribute 2021 contribution to traditional IRA and convert it into backdoor Roth IRA? This way I don't have to pay taxes on my existing $42K

2.) Bite the bullet now, pay taxes on the existing traditional IRA of $42K and convert that amount + 2021 contribution into Backdoor Roth IRA? I can then continue to contribute to backdoor IRA every year moving forward 

3.) Just contribute to Tradition IRA every year and pay taxes when taking out the funds close to retirement?

My employer does offer to convert existing IRA into 401K plan. It is a self managed 401K plan so I don't really pay any management fees. I am 35 and my wife is 32. We both contribute max to our 401K each year + our joint HSA. 

We are in good place financially, both pursuing our master's while working full time in a very stable job and have enough funds saved for emergency situations.

**Scenario 1: I have a job and make capital gains**

Let's say I have a job that pays 80k and I make 10k in capital gains tax. Would my capital gains tax be taxed in the 22% bracket since my job only pays 80k or will I be taxed in the 24% bracket because I'm taxed on the total of my ordinary income + capital gains (80k + 10k = 90k)?

**Scenario 2: I don't have a job and only earn capital gains**

If I don't have a job and make 50k in capital gains would that be taxed at 22% or 10%? I'm not sure if my tax bracket is based on how much I make at a salaried job or based on how much I make total (i.e.. ordinary income + capital gains + every other type of income).

Doing research into an Agricultural Cooperative (because ADM is the only other farming stock I've found but I'm not bullish on huge monopolies). The (preferred) stock I'm looking into is CHSCP. They're a cooperative owned by their own members, but they also have preferred stock with 8% dividend.

My question is: Are the financials for an Agricultural Cooperative listed on the SEC website reflective of the reality in Agriculture? For example if 10 of their members farmed 100k worth of wheat, would the cooperative's financials show 1M revenue from wheat? Or does the cooperative structure change that and only reflect what the cooperative "keeps" from it's members? 

Thanks if anyone can answer!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the actual price of a Rolls Royce Stock right now?!? I am very new to trading as you'll all probably find out.

I have the trading 212 App. On the App if you look at the price of 'Rolls-Royce Holdings' in January of 2020 the price is in the 'p600' range. If i look at the stock on google at the same time period, it's around the '200GBX' range.

Now of course the discount currently on RR (currently priced at '116GBX', and '116p') looks dramatically different if your viewing the graphs on trading 212 or google.

Can someone explain the different metrics to me? and if RR is a decent 2-3 year hold? According to trading 212 the drop is a dramatic one from the 600 range to the 100 range currently YTD. More appealing to buy if that is the case._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Work from Home "Productivity Tracking" I think it's underdiscussed given how significant the next wave of productivity tracking will likely end up being..

&#x200B;

Once machine learning / pattern recognition algo's take productivity tracking beyond the state where employees can "fake" productivity signals with keystrokes, mouse movement, etc, quantified productivity will no longer be "signaled".. it will be real.

&#x200B;

It seems like the value of productivity tracking would at least be a 1:1 multiple on current office worker salaries in many sectors / roles. 

&#x200B;

Then beyond that doubled or tripled productivity benefit, whichever companies end up providing the service and getting the productivity data - they can leverage it into insights and even automated solutions trained from the behaviors of the employees being tracked. 

&#x200B;

With many companies, governments, etc planning on continuing work-from-home as the new normal what are the ballpark revenue expectations for the productivity tracking segment? 

and who will the winning providers will be?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A point of view on RKT Hello everyone. 

I am aware that some of you have curious as to why RKT has not taken off already. I wish to know too. I sent some info analysis to an elder of mine who has been showing me some things that he has learned over his decades of investing and he sent me the following reply. 

I hope to get some thoughts on this reply. 

“My reactions to Rocket Mortgage are:
1.If all goes well like their predictions these would be good returns BUT
2. In the 2008 crash one strategy was for a big organization to form a separate mtge
company, and sell the stock in this separate corporate entity. Then the new entity loaded up
with second rate mortgage risks (which of course paid higher interest rates) which the shareholders could (from a practical point of view) not really evaluate. When many of these mortgage borrowers went south and could not pay this had a major impact on the profitability of the overall return of the portfolio of mortgages. This then had a dramatic  effect on the price of the mtge company stock, The losses did not affect the big organization which also benefited from all the underwriting fees which indirectly were paid for by the mtge company shareholders. Many of these holders would not have invested in low quality, high risk mortgages directly if they had known the level of risk they would be running. There is plenty of boilerplate (cover-my-posterior) language in the fine print of what you sent me.” (Here he is talking about the analysis report I sent him)

“3. Will the Biden administration promote a booming economy with more regulations and higher taxes?
If the economy slows down the first to suffer will be these lower grade mtge's. I personally don't like
complexity when it can be avoided by a more direct approach. Of course, if interest rates are high enough
an organization can survive even knowing that a number of lenders will fail along the way. Loan sharks
have played this game forever. Maybe that is not what they are doing here but I see no references stating that Rocket is seeking only high quality lending risks--the kind JPM is glad to issue loans to itself.
I may be wrong but I did not get a "good feeling" reading this material. All these so called certified
evaluators have (as pointed out) some conflicts of interest because they are paid by JPM, What does
an independent evaluator who sells only info to its customers and has no advertising or other relationship
with a "Rocket" think? Probably no one is covering this entity so you will never know.Do you want to be
a high interest rate money lender to a group of higher risk borrowers? If so, Rocket might be just the ticket.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
