 ABNB investment thesis - tell me where I am wrong ABNB

**What I like:**

* As an upfront disclaimer, I’m focused on investing vs. trading. I'm thinking about ABNB as a long-term hold, like 10-15+ years (think Amazon), so I'm not too worried about Covid and if anything I think the pandemic has given people a greater appreciation of travel/holidays/experiences - i.e. there is a real and underlying growing market for travel/holidays/experiences outside of things like Covid. By the way, I realise referencing Amazon as a benchmark is asking for trouble, but Craigs sent out an interesting email on the 9th of December showing that if you'd invested $10k in Amazon at the IPO then that $10k would be worth c.$2.5m today. Why? Probably because they 'cornered the market', had a strong brand and were well supported/capitalized. Is AirBnb that much different? I think the main difference is that Amazon have much more diverse earnings stream and larger addressable market, but even 10% of that growth rate is still quite attractive
* ABNB have a large addressable market - $1.5T apparently. With \~$5-6b of revenue in 2021, that would be less than 1% of their SAM (serviceable addressable market) of $1.5T. I’m always a bit cautious/sceptical around calculations of SAM and TAM, but it is hard to disagree that it is a large market and that ABNB is probably taking market share and growing the pie
* A very strong brand - 91% of all traffic to ABNB is direct to their website or unpaid. 91% is pretty impressive and very powerful (again, Amazon?)
* Prospectus risks - having had some experience writing prospectuses, AirBnb's comments read more like standard boiler-plate disclosures. It is to be expected that their growth will slow by virtue of the law of large numbers, but none of the sub-points highlighted under risk section particularly worry me. For those actually interested in this post, best you read the risks section of the prospectus rather than me regurgitating them here. The two things that worry me most are (1) the unknown – what blows ABNB up? And (2) I’ve overpaid and hence my returns will be moderated to the point where this isn’t the best use of my capital in a relative sense.
* Competition - look, it's not something I know enough about to be confident, but I think that is par for the course with tech companies. Who knows what Joe in Petone, Peter in Mumbai and Muhammed in Miami are doing in their mothers' garages but AirBnb do appear to have built their brand fast and turned their company name from a noun to a verb. Nobody has ever said "I'm Hiltoning it this weekend"… well maybe Paris does, but hardly a relatable reference point. I do think they'll face some competition around the edges (say, premium travel options, business, other) but the capital raised should help them invest to cement their position.
* Their growth is relatively cheap - no need to fund large buildings and fit-outs/rent. I think they also have an opportunity to broaden their experiences offer and become a portal for experiences outside of accommodation... i.e. restaurant bookings, tours, etc.
* Costs – without a huge amount of fixed overheads, the business does (and has shown that) it has the ability to moderate its cost base during periods of reduced demand.
* Aging population and the rise of the tech-savvy – richer, old people are going to do what they've always done and book hotels, but the next generations are savvy and familiar with AirBnb's offer and concept. AirBnb are swimming with the tide here. The prospectus notes, “While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travellers: as of September 30, 2020, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34.” As the boomers roll-off, there’s going to be plenty of millennials, gen-X, gen-Y and gen-Z rolling into ABNB’s market. Only other comment I’d make here, is that those within the newer demographics are fickle and tend to hop on the latest bandwagon as it emerges. I guess the question I ask myself here is, what could that new bandwagon be? And, if I knew the answer to that I wouldn’t be writing this post! I am really struggling to see what could disintermediate or dissolve ABNB’s relevance, but the limitations of my creativity are a serious handicap here… maybe in time we’ll wake up, plug an IV in to get fed an optimal dose of nutrients, sit in a machine that moves our muscles and wear a VR helmet that connects us with everything. Sounds horrible to me… but in saying that, I didn’t like the sound of Instagram much either.
* Data - pretty cliché observation, but there's got to be value in their data and ways to monetise it. At the current valuation, any upside is probably already captured, so I haven’t attached a meaningful weighting to this.
* Heavily weighted towards leisure travel, which is unlikely to be disintermediated by Zoom etc.
* As a user – I have liked it. I have, and will, continue to use it over anything else when travelling internationally.

**What I’m unsure about:**  
The price I paid ($146)... and the fact that this IPO is effectively a massive transfer of wealth from existing shareholders who have funded the business to date (and taken real risk), to well-connected pigs that dine regularly at the trough with AirBnB's investment bankers… in saying that, the existing, pre-IPO weighted average share price was $6.77, so not much for them to complain about

* Tied to the above, valuation – NB: high probability I may have mucked up some numbers. When there’s so many zeroes floating around it’s hard to keep track. At today’s market cap of around $75b + $1b of debt the EV is around $76b. Assuming forecast revenue next year of around $5-6b, that’s a forward revenue multiple of 15x. Eye-watering, but not entirely ridiculous in a relative sense in the current market (not to be construed as a view that current market pricing is rational/reasonable). Assuming ABNB could, say, get to 5% market share of their SAM of $1.5T, this would equate to roughly $75b in revenue, or 1x today’s valuation. Rough numbers, but Amazon trades today at around 5-6x revenue. Time is of the essence here, but let’s say it takes ABNB 15 years to get to 5% market share and $75b revenue and trades at \~5x revenue. That’d be a 400% return over 15 years. The math being:
   * $75b EV today on $5b of revenue = 15x multiple
   * $5b of revenue today grows at \~20% p.a. over the next 15 years to $75b in revenue (for reference this is roughly equivalent to Boeing or Sony today - [https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/](https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/))
   * At $75b of revenue in 15 years it trades at 5x revenue (a leap of faith), so an EV of $375b
   * Annualised return (assuming no dividends, which are unlikely anyway) is only a 10-12%
   * This is somewhat scary as 20% revenue growth isn’t straight-forward and a 5x revenue multiple and 15 years may also be generous
   * I guess this shows how important entry price is and why this is my biggest concern and why selling out and rebuying if it goes down and/or DCA down are going to be so important
   * By the way, quite aware that this analysis is useful now in hindsight – but I probably wouldn’t have done it had I not invested. So, question I have is whether it’s better to sell and take my loss or go long… current sense is the former
* Competition - I think ABNB is a trusted global brand, but is at risk from regional competitors. What do I mean by this… as a user, when I travel overseas I’m going to use ABNB because I know it, but domestically I’ll look at bookabach, TradeMe etc before booking. So I think you have to moderate ABNB’s addressable market for regional/domestic competitors. It’s probably not going to blow ABNB up, but it could eat away at their domestic travel growth and market share.
* Growth strategy – for a company raising the amount of money it did, the growth strategy in the prospectus was pretty light and wishy-washy
* Slowing revenue growth - I don't like the fact it's slowing, but it’s still \~30%. In saying that, hard to see it growing consistently at 30%+ over the next 10+ years given y-o-y revenue growth to 2019 was ‘only’ 30%
* Business travel risk from increased usage of Zoom etc.
* Regulation – it’s a bit of catch all but I do worry that the business’ cost base expands with highly paid lawyers to manage the obligations within multiple jurisdictions
* More minor risks, but I’ll throw them out there for completeness:
* One-off bad hosting experiences that create apprehensive potential hosts - you know the ones which hit the headlines where the poor host is standing outside watching Jock and his mates punch holes in the walls. A minor risk in the scheme of things, but a flurry of \*\*\*\*ty news stories may turn people off from becoming hosts.
* I think there is a small risk that hosts try to disintermediate AirBnb and go direct or contract directly with repeat customers, whereby AirBnb don't get a cut - i.e. I went to 69 Knob Ave in Remuera last time, we had a good experience, I'll just contact Mrs. Knobette direct, but I think this is a very small risk and more domestic

**So, where am I at?**

* At the moment I’m probably hoping – and that isn’t a good investment strategy
* The rough valuation numbers above don’t fill me with a heap of confidence (I probably wouldn’t have done them had I not invested, so a lesson nonetheless) – I think an ABNB investor can/will make better than average returns, but assuming returns are 15-20% p.a. on a good day, they don’t really feel fair relative to the risk (still not bad, just not on a risk-adjusted basis). I think the only caveat/get-out-of-jail is that market pricing continues to go further away from fundamentals than it already is. Again, seems hopeful, but I’ve been proven wrong over the last 10 years and can’t see anything changing that in the near-term… but I guess that’s the point… it’s what you don’t see that undoes an investment, rather than what you can reasonably predict
* I haven’t bet the house (and thankfully so) – so I guess I’m still willing to gamble my $ on:
   * Covid/vaccine recovery pushing the share price up;
   * Higher/faster growth than expected; and/or
   * Higher multiples;
* I don’t think I’ll lose all my capital on this, but I’ll probably pop it in the bottom draw where I keep my more speculative investments and forget about it for a while (much like I’ve done with PEB, which has served me ok, albeit with plenty of dilution along the way)

\- EXTREMELY low float. insiders have 1.5m shares. if we subtract that from the outstanding its about 15m shares. Uplist will allow IPA to find more institutional investors and lock up the float even more. Barely any warrants outstanding as welll. this company is looking to raise money at a much higher market cap, with institutional investors likely as part of the raise. with this kind of float a few whales buying will make this stock explode

Hi, what are your best tips you could give somebody trying to learn to invest. Luckily I’ve made some stupid mistakes already and learnt.
I started last August at the ATH with £20k invested, since then ive been +-10% (down to £18k, up to £22k)

Now sitting pretty @ £20,050. So £50 profit in 4 months. No bad? Bad for an apparant “bull” run?

My current portfolio is - 120 shares NET and 30 shares SQ.

£11.5k invested with £8.5 in cash.

I’m interested in “growth”, now please tell me if my thought process is wrong, I’ve done my DD on these companies and expect them to be big, big in 5 years, with a hopeful snp500 inclusing for SQ in the future.

I’m going to DCA down on these with the remaining cash as far down as they go, what would be a good protocol for choosing a price etc? 

And literally just fucking HODL.

If i’d done this in OCTOBER or some shit I’d be a good % up for the end of the year instead of just spun my wheels, I guess I’ve just paid for some lessons :)

Anyway my journey so far has been fun. Stocks that have made and lost me money so far

**The company is Sony $SNE**. 

Some important things to know:

* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications
* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)
* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.
* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a "Financial Services" branch that advises on assets.
* Sony is getting into the EV market with [vision-S](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/vision-s/) still early on in its development, but seems to already have some cutting edge tech that they can actually deliver on, unlike many other hype EV stocks.

Lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.

Lets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you can click on a stock purchase order. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, Covid will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!**

Next is the **steady telecommunications segment** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid but in a relatively fast response, they built the "sony electronics corporation", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech hype that is likely here to stay.

Finally **the entertainment branch.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, it was a surprise that the sales in entertainment decreased only 6%. This is thanks to organizations like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and allows Sony to benefit from the streaming wars without having to put skin in the game.

**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+. This does not include the massive shifts that they will be implementing across the org to increase net profits.

a. In 2018, fintech companies represented 38% of the $138B unsecured personal loans market. On the other hand, the banks share dropped from 71% (2013) to 49% (2018).

b. Banks are losing their share from high interest on credit cards, with interest fees expected to drop to \~64B in 2028 as compared to \~$118B in 2018.

c. SaaS, reducing banks to API respondents.

d. Could blockchain be a strong disruptive technology for the banking sector?

Just makes no sense.  If it was the other way around, a delayed arb opportunity would exist in theory.  But with the current setup for prices of units, shares, warrants, and rights, i can’t wrap my head around it.

Earlier today, I’d assumed someone incorrectly entered a market order, but now there are several filled orders at prices that do not compute.

Any thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on target date funds? I wanted to hear everyone’s thoughts on using target date funds for retirement accounts. My 401k and Roth IRA are both 100% allocated into target date funds. I keep all of my individual stocks and other funds in a standard brokerage account._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "Go-to" Stock/mutual fund choices? Hello all!

TL;DR: What are the "standard" recommendations currently for stocks/mutual funds/ETFs?

Having said that, I'll give some background and elaborate further. I tried getting into stocks/mutual funds back in April, recognizing the significant opportunity COVID presented; I had been planning on entering the market for a while, but was waiting for enough time to go research things properly and stabilize financially a bit more before fully committing. As a result of the dip, I realized that was the time to buy in, but got bit with FOMO as a result of rushing the process and inexperience. As I learned, knowing something mentally (do NOT emotionally trade) is very different from actually doing it; also discovered my risk tolerance the hard way! Bailed out without any losses, luckily, but decided to sacrifice the potential gains for peace of mind and a mental reset to reenter later.

Fast forward a few months, and I now have both the time and resources to try it again a second time, the *right* way. I've been casually monitoring a few of these subreddits in the meantime to get a better feel for things and some common recommendations, but now it's time to actually commit and build a portfolio.

I've done a little research on my own already, but figured here would be a good place to get some more information and jumpstart the process. I'm sure there's several go-to recommendations for mutual funds/indexes and whatnot, e.g. the various Vanguard funds, because they've consistently been shown to be good in some area or another (low expenses, growth, innovation, etc); what would be some good ones to look into? I know this is an extremely vague question, but given a lack of a starting point anything will help.

Some other things that might be relevant:

* I have no preference toward US or international; a mix would be great, as recommended. I'm more familiar with U.S. companies and GAAP though.

* Fairly aggressive, with a personally moderate risk tolerance. Time is on my side so high risk from that standpoint is fine, but...nothing too outrageous for my sanity please. Or more like anything that is will be from the "for fun" funds than the actual serious investing money stack. 

* Mid- to long-term. I don't mind doing some trading and active management, but don't have the time to be doing it regularly. 

* Starting funds are in the multiple-thousands, with regular contributions thereafter. 

I'll do my best to answer further questions, especially since I know many of these get into personal preferences. I'm just looking for a solid set to start with!

J_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Small/Micro stocks to invest in 2021 Hello everyone, just wondering if there are any good stocks that people are watching that haven’t blown up yet (IE: 100% already) but have fairly promising potential.

First, people generally made a ton of money in the markets this year so they have an incentive to sell gains in January as opposed to now to push back the tax hit.  Second, tax-loss selling occurs when investors sell at a loss in order to offset capital gains.  That means tax-loss selling tends to impact weaker stocks more than the high flyers.  But the biggest losers in the markets today are not weaker stocks - they're primarily genomics and biotech stocks that have put up big gains this year.

I found myself with about 10k in savings in September and figured it wasn't working for me, so I decided to start investing in the stock market with a buy and hold strategy(I don't need the money any time soon). I've got about $4k in the market right now and wanted to hear some opinions on my portfolio and how I could get better growth.

As of about a week ago I was up 20%, which is only approximately 4K for my tiny portfolio. However obviously there are a lot of sell offs this week, I’ve made some mistakes, and I’ve also gotten a little unlucky as well. So right now I’m sitting around 12% return since September. 

Although the last week has been painful, I’ve learned a lot over the last few months and I am confident about my ability to make better investment decisions going forward. If I’m going to make mistakes I would rather make them with hundreds of dollars instead of thousands, or tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands for that matter. Although obviously no shade here if that has happened to some of you…at the end of the day it is what it is. You gotta pay to play sometimes. 

Here are my main takeaways. These apply specifically to myself, however others may be able to relate to them. Keep in mind this is mostly from the perspective of an investor, not a trader. 


 - Perform sufficient due diligence

 - Dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing

 - Opening positions shortly after an IPO, with $(high volatility)

 - Lacking patience

 - Emotional investing 

 - Early market hours expectations 

 - EOY profit taking

 - Sell-offs after long periods of price run up

 - Dividend day

"Third Point CEO Daniel Loeb wrote to Intel chairman Omar Ishrak calling for immediate action to boost the company's position as a major provider of processor chips for PCs and data centers. The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.

Loeb said in the letter that Intel's most urgent task was addressing its "human capital management issue", as many of its talented chip designers have fled, "demoralized by the status quo".

Intel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.

Intel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.

"Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America's access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more," Loeb wrote.

Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Loeb asked Intel to retain an investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to the sources.

Intel customers, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc, are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote. He suggested Intel must offer new solutions to retain these customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away.

Third Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to pursue deals, including at Prudential Plc, Yum! Brands Inc, Dow Chemical and United Technologies"

First point, everytime I read about a stock and decide to invest I get this urge to buy immediately, kind of this fomo of missing my chance IF the stock goes up. I'll watch the ticker for hours, waiting for a "dip" then buy. 90% of the time a couple hours later or the next day I'm in the red and kick myself for not waiting. Eventually I'll make profit but always think about the more shares I could've had. I understand the market goes up and down but how do I stop buying on impulse and have more patience? Are there any key indicators I should look at; graphs, data points to get a better indication when to jump in? 


Second point, is there a general trend in the daily market i.e. prices are high in the morning then, level out around 11ish and go back up towards the end of the day?


Final point, recently read about covering your cost if you hit 100% return.

Seriously! It's quite apparent that, once things return to some sort of normality then it's going to be an uphill battle for the stock to reach previous highs.  


This isn't the only time I've read articles on the site that I consider are giving poor advice. The only thing I find it useful for is to learn about companies I've not heard of before. After which, I do my own DD.  


What's everyone else's thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Year-end summary. It has been a wild ride! This year has been wild.  I invested, day-traded, and gambled WSB style.  Looking back at the end,  I have to say luck is the difference between the 2 accounts.  

I completely miss the TSLA run-up (paper hand and sold too early).   However, TSLA does have a unique character that is that it likes to hit its pre-market high during the day if it opens 2%-3% lower than its premarket high (when the premarket high is lower than the previous close) so I day traded this stock all the way up.

I baghold NAT, RKT, and HYLN from FOMO like some of us 10k down combined from those 3.  It's too late to cut my loss now since so many people are in the same position and cutting their losses so those three stocks will continue to go down until the year-end.  I'll carry the loss into next year.

Tesla, which started delivering the first vehicles from its gigafactory in Shanghai in December last year, already sources lithium - an ingredient in EV batteries - from China's Ganfeng Lithium, one of the world's biggest producers of the commodity.

The Yahu deal underscores Tesla's "huge demand" for battery-grade lithium hydroxide, "particularly in view of the ramp-up of Model Y production" in Shanghai, the Daiwa analysts wrote in a note.

I've been a lurker for a while but have not written much. I am Canadian accredited investor and primarily focused on small cap stocks with large upside potential, and some of my strongest expertise is in the renewables space with strong returns for both me and my clients. I've bought GRN.V at $0.53 cents and XBC.V at $1.48 using my analysis methods and I think this stock will be my largest return yet and I wanted to share this hidden gem with you guys before it explodes. The stock is UGEIF or UGE.V which is UGE International, a fast growing Canadian solar energy company focusing on the U.S market. 

From a fundemantal perspective, the market cap is only $37 million currently, which is exteremly undervalued. In its last quarter, UGE announced they have a giant backlog of signed projects which is $110 million which is a 200% increase. Even more impressively, these contracts are signed for 20-25 years and produce reoccurring revenue every month for the entirety of this duration. Investors typically pay much higher valuations for reoccurring revenues, as evident by the large increase in AAPL stock after they focused on their reoccurring services side of the business. Also, after adopting a reoccurring revenue model their gross margins increased to a very impressive 48%. Their growth will continue to grow effortlessly and exponentially as businesses will immediately reduce their cost of energy at no upfront cost to them, a proposition businesses cannot ignore. Finally, I believe the stock is ready to explode due to the tight capital structure – just 26.6 million shares outstanding, with more than 50% of those being held by insiders. If that's not enough, one of the biggest advocates and shareholders of this stock is the Robert McWhirter who is well known for finding small caps with large future growth. He has bought into every financing round and has managed over $2.3 billion in his funds. Let's also not forget that Biden pledged to spend $2 trillion dollars on renewable energy infrastructure that will directly benefit UGE. 

From a technical perspective, it is even more bullish. The stock is currently in a bull flag pattern on the daily chart and is ready to explode. A continuation of this move will send it to $2.4 within the next few weeks, an almost 100% gain. On a longer term perspective it is above all the major moving averages on the weekly chart which should continue to provide substantial dynamic support as the stock continues to explode. I would buy UGEIF or UGE.V as soon as possible before the technical formation plays out. 

DISCLAIMER: While I am experienced and have done a lot of research, all stocks pose a risk. I am currently a shareholder, and I also plan to continue increasing my position over the coming weeks and months.

UPDATE 1: the stock is already moving higher as investors are becoming aware. Volume is 3 times higher than the daily average. It will explode this week._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Views about LIT and ETFs for Battery Tech Battery tech is going to get a boost in coming years.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARCT down 40% in post COVID trial news and analyst downgrades Looks like analysts have universally downgraded ARCT after its most recent trials:
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/arcturus-therapeutics-shares-slide-37-in-premarket-after-covid-vaccine-data-are-deemed-underwhelming-11609250275?mod=mw_quote_news

Looks like the vaccine news was underwhelming, specifically around analyst confidence that ARCT can deliver a single shot COVID vaccine.

>  “While this latest dataset does not completely impair single-shot ARCT-021, which may provide protection against COVID-19 infection in Phase 3, the lack of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers at or above levels seen in convalescent sera reduces our confidence that ARCT-021 will be able to achieve competitive levels of vaccine efficacy with single-shot dosing,“ analysts led by Stephen Seedhouse wrote in a note to clients. “At a minimum, the question will be asked by the market and unanswered until Phase 3, thereby limiting near-term upside and justifying a Market Perform rating.“ 

On November 9 when PFE released their vaccine news, ARCT fell 50% from $60 to $33 before rallying all the way to $120. Now it cratered back to $60 as everyone believes that ARCT is just going to "market perform".

I believe this is the way it goes for pharma stocks, where they live and die by results.

ARCT is still a top 5 holding in ARKG: https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_GENOMIC_REVOLUTION_MULTISECTOR_ETF_ARKG_HOLDINGS.pdf

JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.

We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.

We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.

While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.

Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.

[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn’t yet announced anything.

In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can’t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don’t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.

We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman’s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

Now its at 2,47$/shares. I know its a High risk stock right now but every stock new website lists it either a guaranteed lose or a possibly high gain investment.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I am looking to invest somewhere around 15k$ (lump sum) in ETFs and forget it for quite some time (more than 5 years)

Right now, I am considering some EV based ETFs like LIT, DRIV and IDRV. As we might witness a growth of EVs in the next 4-5 years. The returns might be way more than a conventional rate per annum for an ETF. Do you have any thoughts on this idea?

Also, if this not a wise consideration could you please suggest some good ETFs, that can give a good annual returns?

I'm living in the UK right now (might move to Swtizerland next year, but will stay there for the next few years) and using Degiro. I'm looking for advice on how to handle currency conversion when investing in US companies from Europe.

I invested in Amazon a while back. It went up 300 USD. But I'm barely breaking-even in GBP. Similarly many of my stocks which are up 5-10% are yielding no profits. I know this is due to the GBP - USD fluctuations. How do I reduce my losses here? Any tips?

I'm looking to invest 60% of my money long-term in safe-growing stocks, and 40% in short term. Short term plays get quite unpredictable due to the double currency conversion (one when buying, one when selling). I know there is no way to avoid currency conversion. But it would be nice if I can just put in an amount and it gets exchanged to USD, and then everything happens in USD and no currency-conversion happen when buying and selling stocks, and then when I'm taking money out of my broker account, I can convert that USD to GBP to take it out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Evaluating Genome Stocks I’ve been reading up on genome editing and its projected market.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question regarding liquidating long-term investments and taxes I just started investing back in March when the pandemic hit, so I'm still very new to understanding investments and taxation.

As I'm buying ETFs and holding them long term, I'm wondering how taxation will work when I decide to liquidate some of those shares in the future to make large purchases, as I'm still making contributions.

For example, say that I'm contributing each year into my brokerage account and buying a share or two of VOO each year. By year 20, I decide I want to liquidate 20 of my shares and buy a second home. If I'm still making contributions to my brokerage account and bought 2 more shares of VOO that same year, how does taxation work on the 20 that I liquidated? Does it know the difference between the ones I've been holding long term and the one I just bought? 

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice on individual stock portfolio Just to note, I have holdings in an ETF which makes up 50% of my portfolio and I am looking to see if my individual ticker holdings are safe if I were to hold for the long term (over 10 years). I have several thousands invested in each holding. 

I rebalanced these stocks last Friday so that they have an even % except for NET. Have indicated my reasons for choosing these stocks:

~20% in NET as I bought it since it was at $38 and I really believe this to be the leader of cybersecurity and have no intention of selling at all. 

Evenly distributed in:

AMD- I believe this to be the market leader in the next few years when it comes to the industry. Am also a satisfied user of their products.

APG- This is the largest fire protection system service (and other businesses) in the USA. Have had share buybacks, increased guidance, good revenue and undervalued IMO. I got in at $16 a share for this and despite it being a very slow grower (fast in usual markets, slow in 2020 terms , to be clear), I like it’s stability. Regardless if the buildings are being occupied by tenants, fire services systems still need to be maintained. Therefore it has not really been largely affected by the pandemic. 

NIO- I actually got in at an average of $15 a share, scaled down to make it even with my other holdings. I believe NIO to be a great leader of the pack besides Tesla, am okay to let my holdings ride on this as I have already took profits. Understand the risks of holding a Chinese company, but this is the company I firmly believe in. I have a lot of exposure to the Chinese market and hear a lot of good comments in the auto industry about NIO gaining more and more traction in China. I studied in China and use their social media Weibo to track trends in their country like JD, PDD etc.

DIS- New holding, understand that the price just reached an ATH last week but firmly believe in the growing business of Disney+ ( I an a subscriber of this and I love it) as well and returning revenue of theme parks, movies etc when the pandemic is over, can accept short term fluctuations as I intend to hold for many years.

MWK- got in last Friday, I like it’s methodology in increasing revenue. In simple terms they use their own software/AI technology to discover trends and sell stuff on amazon and the likes, last few quarter revenue was stellar. Believe it to be a new trend that I’m willing to invest in, and if they use their technology for other purposes, it could be game-changing. Have actual revenue unlike other newer companies. 

CHWY- I actually got in at $69, but I sold all at $105 last week and then bought it back at $104 a share as I decided it should be a long term hold. I am down quite a bit on this after Monday’s brutal drop, but CHWY is a good example of a stock with great earnings beat and a huge loyal fanbase. I rarely see a customer of CHWY giving bad comments on the service. Some people argue that AMZN is going to be a huge disruptor but I don’t think I am that worried about it because using CHWY is a very sticky service once you use it.

SQ- Cash App is just going to get bigger. Cashless payments are not going to just disappear when the pandemic ends. I got in at around $230 because I decided for this to be a long term hold and do not see the need to time the market. Down a few % right now but am not worried as this company has great leadership and innovation.


In general, NIO, CHWY and MWK are slightly ‘aggressive’ picks of mine while the rest seem to be stable in the long-term (I may be wrong) To make this a more concentrated discussion, I would love to hear your opinions on these holdings and what you think they may deliver in the long term. I understand that there are many more stronger picks out there but I prefer to choose companies that have shown an improvement in revenue, and will not be phased out when the pandemic ends. I also wish to have peace of mind and not having to monitor stocks daily. As a reminder, these are meant to be held for MANY years, and I will probably only consider selling it if there are some huge negative news on the stock that changes its outlook. Thank you all and I appreciate all helpful comments!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which growth ETF? I have about $12k in VOO and $3k in IVOG... going to be rounding up to $15k in S&P and am thinking about moving the $3k from IVOG + another $2k to another growth ETF this week (away from S&P midcap 400).

I dont know much about the different growth indexes, their returns and their market focus. I was looking at the Russel 1000 Growth index (and iShare or Vanguard ETF), but was considering the Russel 2000, too...  They seem attractive because of the larger stock count & increased diversity / lowered risk. Any advice or recommendations to look into is appreciated.

My plan is to invest $1500 a month indefinitely, with $1000 in the S&P and the remaining $500 in riskier growth indexes. I dont have enough time anymore to micromanage my portfolio on a day to day basis so I figured it would be a good way to passively accrue without much risk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Decisions for Long Term Holdings? I have the majority of my retirement fund in a total market and total international market (FZROX and FZILX).  I also have 10% in ARKK (innovation ETF).  I have a long time horizon and this is a Roth IRA.  I also plan to move these funds into bond funds slowly starting around age 50~60.

I want to add a few long term stocks as well but I’m not sure on what makes the most sense. 

Currently I have (10% of portfolio):

**Amazon (AMZN)**

**Apple (AAPL)**

**Disney (DIS)**

**Facebook (FB)**

**Google (GOOG)**

**Waste Management (WM)**


I am bullish on tech (and like to have WM as a hedge), however, since the index is already weighted so heavily in tech, am I increasing my weight unnecessarily?

I see myself with a few options, which would you choose?:

1) Drop my tech holdings and really research well 5-10 value stocks to put my 10% stock allocation in. 

2) Keep 1-2 tech stocks and then add other variety growth stocks (BRK.B, UNH, MCD for example). 

3) Drop my individual holdings all together and just keep my one ETF (ARKK) and possibly purchase a few more ETFs that I like (VWO maybe). 

Any ideas on this?  I really do believe tech will grow drastically overtime but I’m not sure if I’m giving myself more growth opportunity by betting on value stocks instead.

In summary - I lost $373.00 on TSLA options. I then gained $850 on TSLA shares and sold the TSLA shares after holding for 3 months. I then invested in some other stocks with the TSLA gains and am currently down $205 on these stocks. I am thinking of selling these stocks before 12/31/2020 to write off the TSLA gains when it comes to Tax Season; as I see no point of holding these shares at a loss when I can sell then before year end to reduce the capital gains tax I would pay for TSLA gains 

My questions are: 

1. Are capital gains/loss tax for 2020 calculated from Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020?
2. My friend told me if I sold these shares for a loss, I am unable to buy these same stocks if I want it to go toward capital loss. Is this true? 
3. Are losses from options considered capital losses? or only common shares?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ALPP - What the Acquisition of Vayu Drones Means The acquisition of Vayu Drones is HUGE news and in my opinion and should be the greatest catalyst for this stock moving forward.

In my prior posts I spoke about Impossible Aerospace and their US-1’s use for military application, fire departments, police departments etc. Goldman Sach’s see’s even larger opportunities for scale in…

&#x200B;

* Construction
* Agriculture
* Insurance Claims
* Offshore Oil/Gas and refining
* Coast Guard
* Customs and Border Patrol
* Real Estate
* & More

The acquisition of Vayu is incredibly interesting because it launches them forward in the most profitable drone sector of them all….**COMMERCIAL DRONE USAGE**.

**QUICK FACTS ON VAY****:**

&#x200B;

* 44lb payload capacity drone
* TESLA FOUNDER’S Martin Eberhard and Marc Terpenning are heavy investors
* Partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates foundation
* Partnership with Verizon

Vayu Drones are remarkable in their payload capacity with the G1 having 12lb capacity and the G2 boasting an impressive **44lbs of payload.**

[**https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-adds-to-its-commercial-drone-holdings-with-its-acquisition-of-vayu-us-inc-301198626.html**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-adds-to-its-commercial-drone-holdings-with-its-acquisition-of-vayu-us-inc-301198626.html)

The drones are currently used in 3rd world countries to deliver medical supplies and other goods to poor villages that are difficult to access by roads. These drones have saved lives as they are able to transport samples to medical staff and deliver medicine/vaccines quickly and efficiently.

[https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-supplies-madagascar-46880863](https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-supplies-madagascar-46880863)

The drones are autonomous, so they can be launched from a site, land in the desired destination, then return to launching point without having an experienced UAV pilot. This autonomous programming will be huge for distribution and fulfillment centers in the future. Think amazon and having the ability to have an army of drones at a warehouse that can autonomously leave and deliver packages of up to 44lbs, then return to the warehouse.

Food deliveries are also a potential usage for these drones though I feel the cost would have to come down substantially.

The combination of Impossible Aerospace and Vayu drones under one room is mind-boggling. You now have battery patents and technology that lead to flight times 3x that of competitors accompanied with patents and technology that lead to 44 POUND payloads. Having shared technology between the two companies will lead to the largest and most impressive drone company in the United States. You now have max flight time AND max payload. 

Impossible Aerospace’s Spencer Gore (former TSLA battery engineer) is now joined by 2 of the founders of Tesla in what is sure to be a monumental UAV company. People of this caliber do not end up together at a company that is going no where.

More military and civil contracts are almost guaranteed to be acquired by ALPP but I’m especially excited about the development of technology to unleash the inevitable beast in widespread commercial drone usage. 

Would love to hear everyones thoughts on this. Keep in mind I’m not a financial advisor so do your DD lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tell me 2-3 stocks I should sell.

#### VLO_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help me build a long term portfolio. Like many of the people here on Reddit, I started investing this year. I’ve had good luck with penny stocks and have been able to turn $300 into about 5k since this summer. 

However, going into the new year, I’m looking at a more stable form of investing. I recently invested in  ICLN about a month ago and realize that ETF’s seem to be a safer (read not completely safe) way of long term investing. 

I’m looking to put about 10k in at the beginning of the year, and let my investment sit indefinitely. Still young so don’t need to YOLO my savings, but certainly can tolerate some risk as well. Other than ICLN I’m looking at ARK as well. Just don’t know which ones. 

Looking for advice on this 10k portfolio. What should it consist of? Thanks for you recommendations in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you had 3k to invest in your first stocks, what companies would you invest in?

Anything is appreciated. Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The wheel QQQ vs lump sum ARKK Need some thoughts on a strategy. 

Trying to decide between lump sum investing into ARKK or doing the wheel option strategy on QQQ for the weekly premiums. 

One one hand, the growth of ARK is no joke. They have proven that active can beat passive at least in the short term. However they are getting larger and larger and it might become difficult for them to maintain their allocations if they get too large. 

The other hand, QQQ has done really well over the last decade. Democrats might try and break up big tech though which is a large part of my hesitation to go long on it. That’s why the wheel interests me. The weekly premiums seem decent and could supplement my income.

I'm 30, I currently have a $100K portfolio in individual stocks and $35K in Wealthfront's robot advisor.

I have recently closed that Wealthfront and moved to a Vanguard brokerage account because I'd like to pick my own investments. I have sold all stocks/ETFs but $VTI as I want to reallocate my money. I'm gonna be adding $15K (total \~$50K) or so (will also keep adding monthly) and I'd like your feedback on what I'm looking at.

&#x200B;

What I'm thinking:

* 50%: VTI
* 15%: ARKG (want to bet on future of genomics so indexing a bit more here)
* 10%: ARKF (I like ARKF more than ARKQ at the moment. Maybe I'll add it later on.)
* 10%: ARKW
* 5%: ARKK (already heavily invested in tech in my individual stocks portfolio but I like this ETF)
* 5% VXUS
* 5% VWO

&#x200B;

VTI:

I'm holding some already, is there a general consensus on VTI vs VTSAX ? It seems like VTI's expense ratio is 0.1% lower and more tax-effective. And leaning towards VTI instead of VOO as VTI is more diversified.

&#x200B;

VXUS and VWO:

What are your thoughts here based on my other picks ? VWO is 97% emerging market, VXUS is 25% emerging markets, 38% Europe, 29% Pacific.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your feedback !_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I need some advice!

New partnership with Saudi Telecom

Alibaba, Saudi Telecom partner on $500M cloud services push in Saudi Arabia
Dec. 28, 2020 1:33 PMAlibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)By: Brandy Betz, SA News Editor
Under a new partnership, state-owned Saudi Telecom Company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) Cloud, and VC fund eWTP Arabia Capital will provide public cloud services in Saudi Arabia.

The partnership will involve a $500M investment over five years. Alibaba Cloud will set up a new office in Riyadh to provide services and training.

The price has been dropping since October, from what I can find it's being driven by multiple factors such as analysts downgrading their price estimates, expiry of the lockup period for early stage investors, and the increasing competition.   


What are people's thoughts on this stock long term?   


I like the idea of these new growing stocks that are bringing these new products to market but I'm not sure if 5 years on BYND will be a good investment. They've shown good growth in revenue over the years, and there feels like more and more generations are starting to favor plant based food over meat.
