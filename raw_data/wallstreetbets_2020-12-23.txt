So I know we all enjoyed the memes from the ~~Trump~~  JPow era (some more than others) but for the better or the worse, we got another retard coming to the WH to do the same autistic stuff for a different party. But maybe this new retard can get us some cash, which in the end is all you filthy degenerates care about. I know most of y'all here can't read more than the 4 letters of the ticker, "to the Moon" and "PLTR" so to keep it short: Biden made it one of his policies to get us legalized weed on a federal level, and even if that doesn't work, many states will legalize (or rather, did so) it through ballot initiatives. This, for those who still haven't sobered up yet, means we might have a new market rising in the US 

Aside from that we've had interesting movements in the weed market, for instance, a week ago Aphria Inc. (APHA) and my current bet Tilray (TLRY) announced a merger that'll make them the biggest cannabis producer in the world, and not just that [they're planning to enter the US market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/12/17/after-blockbuster-merger-worlds-largest-cannabis-company-eyes-us-market/?sh=161d09b87d65), which can make it a good investment for those here who aren't autistic and can sit on a stock for more than a week. And today particularly has been good for the weed sector, just 4 hours ago Aurora (ACB) spiked 7.4%, Canopy Growth (CGC) went up 6.7% and my TLRY got an 8.2% an hour ago (still red on that one tho lmao), not to mention that these stocks seem to be rather cheap for the kind of market (TLRY was trading at 200 at some point) so if you managed to save some of your tuition money from the PLTR short, or if you can ask your wife's bf, now might be the time, just saying ;)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It ain't much but it's honest work - 1 month gain porn - No Options 1000 to 0 Shares Remaining PLTR 15 - 30

They are able to produce cannabis is Colombia for about 1/10 of the cost that Canopy does.

They also have the highest standard quality weed and have started shipping it in the EU with their approval.

**News**

Demand for “Fixes” (when a “stylist” chooses some clothes to send to a customer) is so low that there is no work for stylists. A source who works there (let's call her SnitchFix), says that Stylists are literally being told to do the minimum hours they can because there is not enough work to go round.

(edit: removed proof cause of SEC and stuff)

# On top of that, a winter storm took out one of their three warehouses so their delivery output was reduced by a third. This is a major fucking news.

**Technicals**

SFIX  went up 100% in 11 days (from $35 to $70) based on 10% increase in quarterly revenues. This was the short squeeze GME gang has been wet dreaming about. But it's over.

the overall volume has declined, but short interest volume has increased (see below).  Too many traders and investors believe that [$SFIX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SFIX) went up too fast too quickly-- it is time for a reality check. When (and not if) one or more institutional shareholders decide to sell to cash in their yearly profits.

so basically its gonna crash. treat yourself to an early xmas present and get some poots.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stop holding your bags, most stocks historically always drop on Christmas Eve. Sell now and hide or buy puts for tomorrow. **UPDATE #1: AH today, and already any stocks are showing declines or diving at 90 degree angles with some being flat, and only a few struggling to be up. Tomorrow it will be doom. Options holders it's too late, but if you have shares, sell now!**

People on here are excited by several stocks rocketing for various reasons, usually stocks that shouldn't with some exceptions, and many of you believe that you can keep holding instead of taking profits but there's a problem:

***Christmas Eve.***

***Historically almost every listed stock (not OTC) drops on Christmas eve***,  and the few that are up are always gambles most would never expect to be up due to recent history, bad news, or other negative reasons.

And those of you who have longer options or shares thinking that you can take the hit and hold past are in for a painful ride. Most stocks even with good news crash on Christmas eve or start trashing, and the next couple months or more, depending on the security, it'll crash until it reaches it's stagnant point and will basically stay in that price range unless something causes the stock to break out.

This leaves many shareholders taking massive losses and seeing not much movement for months or more depending on the stock/etf, and Option holders almost never outlast this stagnation before expiration.

***This has been the case every Christmas Eve since 1981*** with one exception and that was due to an unusual injection into the markets in the late 80's.

So the bottom line is, unless you want to gamble on which stocks are going to shoot up tomorrow or after tomorrow, which is likely NOT any of the stocks you are holding or are keeping track of...

You should sell your calls or all/portion of your shares now, or close to closing if you think there's more room to run in the next hour and a half.

And then just wait until things are clearer later on, or buy puts for option holders and get those drop gains. But then expect **many** stocks to be in limbo in the same price ranges for quite some time. **It could be weeks, months, or years before the stock rebounds to near or at the highes of now.**

***IF YOU ignore this warning*** you will be selling nothing, or hopelessly left with the bag one day hoping the stock goes back to that 2020 high that May/will never come again in all likely hood.

I think we have a fucking amazing opportunity in front of us here today. "What's that?" you might ask. I'm talking about the potential marijuana boom following a Democratic Takeover of the Senate, which is very much in the realm of possibility.

We currently stand at 50-48, Republican Seats/Democratic Seats in the Senate; Democrats already have control of the House. The last 2 seats will be determined in the GA Senate Runoff Election, and boy is it close. A few weeks ago it seemed as if Republicans had it in the bag, but as of recent, polls are showing Democrats taking a slight lead. With a lot of early votes being cast, and turnout numbers similar to the presidential race, I really think the Democrats could take control of the Senate, as Harris would cast her vote to break the tie in favor of Democrats.

So what does this mean for the marijuana industry? It means bills will be able to hit the floor and get voted on, something that Mitch McConnell has blocked since retaking control as the Majority Whip in 2015. This in turn means reform, as the Biden administration has vowed to make changes: decriminalization, banking, etc. There are huge barriers restricting the growth of MJ in the largest MJ market in the world. A Democratic Senate would unleash the dogs, open the floodgates; whatever idiom you prefer, its will be BIIIIIIIG. And in my opinion, this event is not yet priced into the market. I think the run-up to this event will start soon, so if you're interested in profiting from it, then rev up your engines because its going to be a wild, volatile ride; high risk-high reward.

In terms of positions, I really like TLRY, MSOS and IIPR.

For TLRY, the recent merger with APHA will peg the company at around a $3b valuation, about 1/3 of the valuation of CGC. Once merged, the new company will be the largest company by revenue in the world (won't last long but still significant revenue for a global company) and headquartered in the US; they already have operations there (Manitoba Harvest, a hemp-foods company, and SweetWater Brewing Co, a terpene infused craft beer maker.) They now have top branded MJ products from APHA's portfolio in the Canadian market. TLRY also has a partnership with Budweiser to make CBD infused beverages; a partnership with Sandoz (an arm of Novartis, a major pharmaceutical company) to support the commercialization of non-smokeable, non-combustible cannabis products; a partnership with Authentic Brands Group to market and distribute cannabis products (if unfamiliar with these guys just do a quick Google search to see who they work with: celebrities like Shaq, companies like Forever 21. Blackrock holds a minority stake, NBD); contract with the DEA (one of few) to study medical marijuana at UC San Diego; access and partnerships in the EU, particularly Poland (where their major grow-op is located), Israel, Germany, and Italy; multiple clinical trials set-up globally to study cannabis. To get more info on all this you can look at investor presentations from the past including their newest one, post-merger. These guys are a big deal.

There's a lot of chatter and negativity about these guys, understandably so. They burn through cash like no ones business, they're still not profitable and people don't like that their Executives sell shares hand over fist, amongst other things. Because of the negativity surrounding these issues they have relatively some of the highest short interest amongst major MJ companies so it's very volatile. I personally feel that TLRY has been beaten down to hard considering all it's done so far. They are the first movers, pioneers or trailblazers in a huge industry, and one thing I know for sure, as I worked in the industry once upon a time, that major investors want to see companies making moves, and TLRY is doing just that: MAKING MOVES.

They have a low share float as well and when these shares pop, they pop. Just take a look at the charts and see for yourself how the stock moves. Most recently the presidential election sent TLRY soaring along with the likes of many other MJ names. TLRY saw some of the biggest gains of them all. I remember seeing someone post of WSB that they put $150 down on Nov 6 weeklies on Wednesday Nov 4. When they cashed out that Friday do you know how much that measly fucking $150 was worth? Over $10k!!! Are you fucking kidding me!? I follow this industry like a crazy person and I haven't ever had a win that big. FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! JK but not really... congrats...? kinda... whatever, fuck you.

I could say more about TLRY but I'd probably burn you all out, if I haven't already. So I'll move onto MSOS real quick which is the first ETF of its kind, listed on the NYSE with exposure to American Multi-State Operators. Nuff said.

Now for the hedge: IIPR. You might be saying to yourself, "This dude is retarded. How can IIPR, another MJ company, be a fucking hedge to the MJ play on the GA Senate Runoff results? Go read about what an actual hedge is dumbass! You don't know poop from applesauce!" But please let me explain first before you "professional" traders get your man thongs up in a bunch. IIPR is running strong and has been for good reason. It's an REIT specifically for the US Medical-MJ industry. The use capital "to acquire income producing real estate" and their "sale-leaseback and other real estate solutions offer an attractive alternative to state-licensed medical-cannabis operators who have limited access to traditional financing themselves." In other words, without access to banking partnerships with major financial institutions, which is prohibited by federal law (and banks abide by it because they'll lose access to government subsidies), MSOS's have seemingly nothing else to turn to for financing besides IIPR if they want to grow and scale their operations across the US.

So bringing it all together here's how I see this playing out. TLRY and MSOS benefit from a Democratic takeover of the Senate and we could see instant price appreciation given the future revision of federal US MJ laws, and in context of this DD, access to future banking partnerships and being able to potentially receive cheap loans like every other legal industry, through the passage of the SAFE Act. If Republicans maintain control, I believe these names will be negatively affected (the risk therein.) Right now TLRY is still in buying range even as it rises today while I write this article, most recently bouncing off support. MSOS is coming off ATH's so use TA to find a good entry; I'd recommend scaling in and cost-averaging if you're an eager beaver. (Just a note on TLRY, my #1 play: today someone bought $11 Feb Calls and $15 March Calls for a total of around $350k in premium and at the time was worth about $5m in stock at that price. I don't think anyone is betting that they're about to waste $350k in premium on options contracts... just saying. My lucky ass happened to be averaging down on those March calls by the end of last week and the beginning of this week. Booyah!)

I'm still trying to determine how IIPR will play out in this scenario but I truly think that a Democratic Takeover of the Senate would have a negative affect on its stock price near term as it becomes more obsolete, but not totally (plus its coming off ATH's so its hard to say where it finds its next level of support, which I think it could settle around the $180 mark; time will tell.) IIPR will still be a viable investment as it is very profitable, increases its dividend QoQ, and is growing fast. Plus these laws will take some time to be passed and implemented in this scenario, but remember the market is a future value pricing mechanism. It wouldn't surprise me though to even see it rise as it's still an MJ stock. In the case of Republicans maintaining control of the Senate, I see IIPR being a benefactor here given its current function, but coming off ATH's I think we need to see more consolidation for a more favorable entry point but still a good play none-the-less.

There you go everyone, take it as you wish. The information is there for you all to dominate on. I have about 30% of my portfolio on TLRY calls which is small potatoes but I'm holding these bad boys for a big payday. Still scoping a position in MSOS and IIPR. Good luck ya'll and happy investing. Let me know if there's any questions and I would love to hear your feedback!

EDIT/UPDATE:

Ok this one is for the haters who think it's impossible that the DEMS takeover the Senate. Maybe I can make you a beleiber. I mean believer. Wow that was gay of me, (fuck now everyone knows, ahhhh!!!)

Anyways, just days ago I saw 1.3m in early voter turnout; 2 days ago 1.6m; today that number is up over 2m. Hmmmmmm.... let me think... last time early voting numbers came through like this, who won again....? Democrats motherfuckers! The writing is on the wall. Still not in the bag but the bull case grows for pot stocks and I don't give a fuck about stocks that you can't trade with options.

I posted this before in [Daily Discussion before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kir3c3/daily_discussion_thread_for_december_23_2020/ggt8hjc/), and now I shall expand on it too.

I see lots of brothers crying over CRSR, so I am going to shine light on it.

1. CRSR have no marketing team(for stocks btw), they literally do not give a singular fuck about how their stocks do since IPO because of the busy holiday season.

1. It is a long hold, their current price is undervalued because no news are generated for the boomers/traders and you know they can't read anything tech related. Boomers don't care about what it does or what future it has, only whether it would make more money in the future.

>[And while Corsair has been losing money on all of these businesses over the last couple of years — a $13.7M loss in 2018 and an $8.4M loss in 2019 — it seems that COVID-19 has been good to Corsair. The company saw a $23.8M profit between January and June 2020 alone.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21398656/corsair-ipo-billion-dollar-revenue-profit-coronavirus-shelter)

Corsair does PC components(PSU, RAM, PC Case, fans, etc) and peripherals(Keyboards, mouse, headphones, etc). If you missed out on CPU(AMD, Intel) or GPU(Nvidia), this is it. Only competitors listed in NYSE/NASDAQ are Micron and IBM(Random-access memory (RAM) modules market competitors), and their company directions are very different. Rest of Corsair's direct competitors are mostly concentrated in foreign markets(Logitech, Asus, Razer, Samsung(RAM), Gigabyte, Fujitsu, Toshiba, etc) or private(Kingston, G.Skill, EVGA, Steelseries etc).

If you want to sell it, go ahead. I am not here to sell you a stock that will fly to the moon tomorrow. This is a long haul stock that's not for short term holders, this is for the people that recognise and understand the following:

**SO SHOULD I SELL????**

The stock is not GME(big daddy Cohen coming in to make it the ecommerce giant of gaming world), but they are pretty obviously undervalued. You should choose to at least hold it till Q4 earnings report in February which would include Christmas and holiday sales, that is also what people with GME, NVDA, AMD, AAPL and INTL wants to see. Q4 is where the money is always at for tech stocks thanks to Santa, especially so for CRSR who sees the largest sales number per annum on ecommerce site like Amazon during holiday season.

But yeah you can still choose to sell

So I can buy more.

I last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.

Since then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.

**TLDR;**

PSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath's largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a “mature unicorn”. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.

**Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:**

Two aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I've engaged with enough of them online to know):

**1)** Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)

**AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.**

**THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.**

**\*\*\*Another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.** 

**For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.**

**2)** The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.

**Background information and recent events**

· In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman’s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.

· In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:

o He is hunting for a “mature unicorn” - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but "mature" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of Billions.

o He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth

o This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he's also friendly to a FINTECH

o He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.

**o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**

Lisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News

Michael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company

Jackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company

Joseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.

**\*\*We don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives\*\***

o He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far

o **Investors in the SPAC so far include:**

§ Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, “the next Buffet” and noted value investor) = $450M position

§ Guggenheim Capital = $560M position

§ Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position

§ Soroban Capital = $290M position

§ Wells Fargo = $290M position

§ Kevin “Sharktank” O’Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1

§ **Warren Buffet’s** position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.

**§ KEY Point: \*\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\*\***

o The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).

**PSTH SPAC Design**

· PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:

· PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique “tontine” structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the "tontine" name - look it up, pretty cool.

**Targets**

Much speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:

· Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.

· Since that interview, Air B&B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO

**· Stripe has generated intense interest online.** Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that “no such deal” had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother’s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).

**· Bloomberg remains in play.** There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.

· Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.

**Target summary based on my view**

Targets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement

1. Bloomberg
2. Stripe
3. Fidelity

**Bill Ackman**

A few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:

· A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you’re interested in looking into it.

· He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.

· In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.

· Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific

· Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).

**Some other notes**

This is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.

While this isn’t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.

**Good luck to all holders of this massive and massively interesting SPAC.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ALL ABOARD THE GME MOON MISSION 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MGNI overview and brief DD 🚀🚀🚀 **TLDR:** 1/15 $40C if you're feeling risky. 3/19 $35 calls if not.

**What is Magnite and how does it make money?**

Magnite is a sell-side advertising platform (SSP) that aggregates advertising units (aside from GOOG, AMZN, and FB). This is an automated platform that takes these units from publishers across different media channels (e.g., mobile, tablets, Connected TVs, etc.) and then sells them to the buy-side (DSPs like TTD). Magnite makes money through a "take-rate" - essentially taking a cut from the publishers sales. That cut is somewhere in the realm of 8-14%

**Why Magnite over company xyz in this space?**

Magnite has big goals. The companies Telaria (leader in CTV) and Rubicon (leader elsewhere) merged in April to be the #1 player in this space. Think back to that management class you took sophomore year of college where they talked about the BCG growth-share matrix. Magnite is a star (or 🚀🚀🚀), meaning it has a **high growth rate** (we'll get to that below) and **high share**

**Why will they keep going up?**

* The space Magnite plays in is HOT (30%+ CAGR). Linear TV (that $200/mo bill your grandma pays DirecTV) is dying, and streaming is taking over 
* Taking this further - Magnite stands to make money off of streaming content that has advertising (AVODs/FAST). The SVOD market (Netflix and co.) has matured, but ad-based content is just now taking off. Think players like PlutoTV, Xumo, Tubi (all acquired by huge players like CBS, Comcast, and Fox this year). It's the place to be, and Magnite is the winner because it can profit off of all of them
* So far, just a Disney+ relationship has been announced. **Expect more of those announcements** in the coming months.
* In terms of valuation, MGNI is only at a $3B market cap. TTD sits at $30B. 
   * MGNI's EV/rev is \~13, TTD's is 59

**Responses to common comments**

* "They're up 90% in a month, thanks for the late DD"
   * *Better late than never, this was on CNBC for the first time yesterday and the real pump is just beginning*
* "Needham has a $30 PT, which they've already blown by"

SKLZ family and future family...

I took some time and created an accurate DD resource for anyone new and curious about SKLZ and its prospects as an investment going forward. This should serve as a good jumping off point for anyone who wants to research further.

To the best of my knowledge, everything here is FACT and easily verifiable with a google search and/or listening to some of the recent interviews with the CEO, who by the way, is borderline giddy in some of them at the prospect of finally going public.

So without further ado... This is why I sincerely believe that being able to buy into this company at the current valuation is a VERY rare opportunity with huge long-term upside potential.

MARKET GROWTH>>>

\-The mobile game market is currently experiencing explosive growth.

10 years ago it was an 8B market. Today it is 68B. In 2025 it is projected to be a 150B market.

\-Video games are rapidly becoming the leading form of entertainment.

\-Already more popular than books, movies and music, video games are on a path to even eclipse TV.

\-SKLZ DOES NOT CREATE GAMES. SKLZ provides a PLATFORM for game developers to monetize their creations through competition.

\-There are currently 10M game developers world-wide that are are looking for the best way to monetize.

\-Before SKLZ, game developers relied on advertising and in-app purchases to monetize their creations.

\-SKLZ has found that developers who monetize their games through competition (game-centric) instead of advertising are up to 5X More profitable.

\-SKLZ will run 2B (yes BILLION) tournaments in 2022.To put that in perspective, that's 1700 tournaments EVERY SECOND.

\-SKLZ user engagement (minutes a day spent gaming) trumps many other popular platforms.

SKLZ 62 minutesTikTok 52Facebook 41YouTube 40Snap 28Mobile Gaming Average 17

MARKET OPPORTUNITY>>>

\-90% of SKLZ revenue comes from North America

\-TAM outside of North America is roughly 4X as large.

\-SKLZ currently has 2.7M monthly active users.

\-Total MAU world-wide is 2.7 Billion.

That mean currently SKLZ has only penetrated .1% (that's 1/10th of one percent) of the potential market. It's almost impossible to imagine a longer runway for potential growth.

MOAT>>>

\-SKLZ Competitive moat is its Anti-cheat tech which involved years of data science development.

\-SKLZ measures 300 individual data points a minute during gameplay.

Think McAfee Anti-virus but specifically designed for competition-based games.

\-58 issued or pending PATENTS for this Anti-cheat technology.

INVESTORS>>>

The people behind Flying Eagle Acquisition Corporation, the company that merged with SKLZ to take them public are the same people that took DKNG public through Diamond Eagle. Yes... These are the Exact Same Guys.

\-PIPE investors are of the highest quality.

\-Wellington, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Nueberger Berman.

\-Existing SKLZ stockholders and PIPE investors have agreed to a 24-month lock up period, a testament to all involved party's faith in the business.

\-SKLZ has been able to deliver incredibly consistant, predictable growth since 2017.

\-In 2017, SKLZ met with Flying Eagle (DKNG guys) and provided them with growth projections for 3 years out.

\-SKLZ has met its growth projections every quarter within 1%-5% since 2017.

\-SKLZ is expected to grow at 57% CAGR through 2022.

FINANCIALS 2020 Q#/YTD>>>

\-Third Quarter Revenue of 60M, Up 92% YoY-Revenue YTD of 162M, up 91% Over Prior Year-Affirming Full Year Guidance of 255M

\-Gross Margins of 90%+-Long-term projected EBITDA of over 30%.

VALUATION DISPARITY>>>

\-At $20, SKLZ is valued at Approximately 12X 2022 Revenue (P/S 12)

\-Currently SKLZ is valued at Roughly 24X 2020 Revenue (P/S of 24)

\-Unity Software, a company in a very similar space, is currently valued at 60X Revenue (P/S of 60)

CEO>>>

\-SKLZ CEO Andrew Paradise is a Big-Idea kind of a guy.

\-He previously founded and sold his startup AisleBuyer, a company that let consumers check out in stores via their mobile phones, to intuit in 2012.

\-He is always talking about his company's "100-year vision". That vision- Creating the "competition layer" of the internet.

\-My favorite quote from him from a recent interview....

"What a lot of people don't understand about our business is that SKLZ is not so much a video game system as much as it is.... (wait for it...... ;) a DATA AND FINANCIAL PAYMENTS SYSTEM.

Aka... FINTECH.

Big things in the future here folks, short AND long-term.

As always... Good Luck!!!!

TLDR; BUY DIZ SHIT!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GILD looks golden (1) GILD will be depressed through December 31st due to tax loss harvesting. (Hedge funds are riding this wave.) But, the wave of tax loss selling is almost over.

(2) GILD will also benefit from a rotation to value in 2021.  Just for holding this deep value stock you pick up a 4.77% dividend at these levels.

(3) GILD looks like a takeout target at these levels. Could we see an early January surprise like CELG getting bought by BMY in January 2019?!  Major pharma deals (like Celgene, Allergan, Alexion) had an average take out premium of around 45-50%. 

Roche could be interested in GILD.  They are the leader in cancer drugs and GILD’s pipeline of cancer drugs is vastly under appreciated.

(4) GILD is way too cheap. At 12x Enterprise Value / EBITDA it’s a steal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME management & Ryan Cohen remind me a lot of the Blockbuster & Carl Icahn disaster of 2010 Look, I'm not a GME hater, am genuinely thrilled for u/DeepFuckingValue and I hope you all get rich speculating in a GME turnaround. But I remember the 2005-2010 drama around BB and GME right now has too many eery similarities for me to go anywhere near it.

BB had 9,000 stores and had cornered the home video market. Retail landlords sought out BB locations because they generated traffic for the restaurants and grocery stores nearby, it exploded in store count in about a decade. It's core business became a melting ice cube as Netflix's mail DVD business and streaming business took off, along with Redbox rental boxes at gas stations and convenience stores. EPS got killed as it steadily closed thousands of stores due to plummeting revs. Icahn steps in during this decline to buy a big stake, urges changes to the core business model, got into disagreements with the board and president and ultimately sold his stake for less than ten percent of what he paid. Months later, BB is bankrupt. Icahn has repeatedly said BB was the worst investment of his life.

Idk if GME is going to end up the same way, I do not know because the dynamics in the gaming industry and console cycle are a bit different than the movie and home rental business in the 2000s. But the parallels are eerily similar. You have two retailers that had explosive store growth over a decade or so due to active solicitation by commercial landlords at the urging of anchor tenants who want the foot traffic, you have two retailers that then are quickly eaten alive by plummeting store revs due to innovative competiton, you have shares that have precipitously fallen in price as the companies have frantically closed underperformong stores to stop the bleeding, you have big gun activist investors coming in late in the life cycle pushing changes to the core business that are merely a hope and a prayer (at this point for Cohen anyway, GME has barely acknowledged the demands), you have opportunistic retail investors coming in after the fact hoping the hope becomes a new business model and bidding the shares up.

Maybe Cohen can push the changes through. I have zero faith in GME management turning the core B&M business around, let alone stabilize it. Why? This is purely anecdotal - a couple of months before COVID, I passed by GME's new concept store while staying at the Mall of America. It is called "Gamestop: Pop Culture." It was a Gamestop with substantially lower floor space dedicated to games, with the remaining 75% of the space selling gundam kits and Hello Kitty and anime and Funko Pops. So GME management's grand idea to save the business before Cohen was to fight ThinkGeek over the dying table scraps of mall traffic. I am not convinced.

TLDR - Long ROKU, $700 target._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ OTGLY CD Project Red DD To thank WSB for the $150k gain I made this year by reading other DDs, below is analysis of Cd Projekt Red and full disclaimer I own 1500 shares bought in at $18.7.

The caveats:

* Company hyped up the game to the moon, release was buggy for 7-year-old older PS4 and Xbox consoles. Company was not able to even find most these bugs during their testing stage.
* Company "manipulated" reviewers by not sending OG console version for review. Company execs tweeted the game played "surprisingly good" on OG console right before launch, which is now leading the investigation of class lawsuit on security fraud.
* Even if the game wasn't buggy, gamers believe the company false advertised the game as next generation open-world RPG with non-linear story telling and impactful life choices - but the game is rather more like a more open action RPG where most of the open world components were either cut or still under development at this moment.
* Because of how bad the game was in terms of FPS and bugs, Sony pulled the game a week ago and issued refund for all play station gamers.

The pros:

* Company management and exec team owns a large stage of the company (>15%) and have been running the company \~20 years. For a game studio of more than 1k employees, their execs are under paid relative to the industry [https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/media/wse-cdr/cd-projekt-shares/news/our-take-on-cd-projekts-wsecdr-ceo-salary](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/media/wse-cdr/cd-projekt-shares/news/our-take-on-cd-projekts-wsecdr-ceo-salary) this shows strong financial incentive for long term performance of the company from the management team.
* Through the most recent post release conference call, we learned that COVID has impacted their QA partners and QA process where testing among multiple remote location and onsite location renders issues harder to identify - this shows a temporary problem and as more gamers are playing and sending live data to the game, bugs are going to be easier to reproduce and patched. In fact as ridiculous as it sounds, the more buggy the release is, the easier it would be for the company to fix these bugs. Full conference call script can be found here [https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=conference-calls](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=conference-calls) another thing to consider was The Witcher game also suffered serious bugs at launch.
* The company is known for its strong suit for story telling and artistic choices among most studios and Cyberpunk 2077 still mostly nailed it. While other game studios aim for safe and conventional re-skin of their games, the company takes risks and explores new territories of visual designs, which creates down stream pop-culture effects for Movies (Netflix), Phones (OnePlus) and other peripherals where CDPR could benefit from which I don't believe can be priced in short term as artistic societal impact is hard to quantify the photo mode as well as character design is done super well in the game (as seen in [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/) ) and we can see that gamers still largely support the game due to its artistic and story telling merits, and I believe these are going to overweight the issues with car riding and cops for the long term reputation of the game.
* China - The OnePlus Cyberpunk phone is now exclusively launching in China ( [https://www.oneplus.com/cn/8t-cyberpunk2077?from=head](https://www.oneplus.com/cn/8t-cyberpunk2077?from=head)). We won't have actual licensing fee per unit but the phones have sold out. As gamers in China are mostly on PC and there are a huge population there where the original sales projection didn't include China as there is no official channel of sales (gamers mostly download pirated copies), I think this is an untapped market CDPR will get in soon. [https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/sales-china](https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/sales-china)
* Despite the removal of the Play Station game, as of 12/20 the game sold 13 million copies (factored in refunds), lower than 16 million copies of expectation at launch. Consider half of their sales are console and play station is around another half of all console market, missing 3 million is pretty on the mark and it could also mean their PC is performing better than expectation. The original stock price moving average at $25-30 was anticipating 30 million copies sold over the next 12 months with a potential upside to $30-35, which if accomplished will still give a lower multiple valuation/earning to the stock price similar to EA and Ubisoft for the Cyberpunk 2077 game alone. The current stock price around $18 would be justified from industry average multiple if the game sold for only under 20 million copies over the next 12 months without any other sales from their other games. After the bugs are patched, newer consoles are available, Ubisoft gamers finished Watchdog and Valhalla and are looking for new stories, I believe the game can still easily deliver over 30 million copies in 2021 which will support a price target of $30-35.
* Fandom around Cyberpunk culture and word of month from the romantic storylines should not be underestimated (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/FollowersofCyberJudy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FollowersofCyberJudy/)), and this is what WatchDog, GTA, and other games do not have and I'd expect the network effect from people posting memes, character stories which could drive more sales are not priced in. I'd argue CDPR is a mater of pop culture story telling therefore [https://www.dualshockers.com/the-witcher-season-2-first-script-page-revealed/](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-witcher-season-2-first-script-page-revealed/)
* Lastly people forgot that only half of the CDPR team is working on CyberPunk, others are working on existing and new games. With 13 million copies already covering the cost of development, I don't see any financial issues even if the company settle the lawsuit (if it ever materializes) and it won't impact their development pipeline of other games. Witcher is still ongoing and their Switch sales number likely won't be revealed until March [https://gamerant.com/cd-projekt-red-praises-witcher-3-performance-switch/](https://gamerant.com/cd-projekt-red-praises-witcher-3-performance-switch/)

Other WSB factors

* CDPR predicted that their whole game is going to be a meme two years ago [https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1013883730929340418?s=20](https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1013883730929340418?s=20) and it indeed becomes one.

Two thing are so overhyped rn: SPACs and EV. Now that EV is booming, companies that make LIDAR sensors (which make electric cars self-aware  and autonomous). I know you guys just buy meme stocks without knowing what they do, but that's what $LAZR does and why it was hyped to 4x NAV.  


Ouster literally THE leader in autonomous vehicle LIDAR, was rumored to be nearing a deal to merge with SPAC $CLA. Now the deal has been officially announced, but they haven't merged yet obviously and no DA yet so it appears. Source is Reuters and this was also covered by Bloomberg. Both have a great track record with breaking SPAC news.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn-exclusive-idUSKBN28W00B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn-exclusive-idUSKBN28W00B)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn/lidar-start-up-ouster-agrees-1-9-billion-deal-to-go-public-idUSKBN28W1D3](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn/lidar-start-up-ouster-agrees-1-9-billion-deal-to-go-public-idUSKBN28W1D3)  


$LAZR is sitting on a $12.3B market cap with these projected sales: $15M this year and $418M in 5 years. $CLA on the other hand (if and when this deal goes through) has a market cap of $2.8B when it has more projected sales this year $18M and has double the projected sales in 5 years: $818M. 

[https://twitter.com/DJohnson\_CPA/status/1341395521169215488?s=20](https://twitter.com/DJohnson_CPA/status/1341395521169215488?s=20)

If $CLA is priced based on where it is now, based on the way the free market priced $LAZR, $CLA should have a market cap of $14.8B which means a share price of $81 (5.5x INCREASE!). But it gets better, based on future growth which I know the market loves $CLA should have a market cap of $133 (8.5X INCREASE!). I know these valuations for EVs/LIDAR is bonkers, especially for $CLA but still, that's the way the market is pricing this stuff. So when I tell you a 2-3X increase from $CLA, I'm being conservative.  


Not only that, but I'm even more bullish on Ouster compared to its LIDAR competitors. LIDAR is super expensive and Ouster's goal is to be cost-effective. It's pricing is noticeably cheaper than LAZR. A similar product that is cheaper translates to more widespread adaptability. Furthurmore, unlike its LIDAR competitors, Ouster is not tied down by the EV industry with only \~20% of its sale constituting EV vehicles. The rest are in industries such as tech and industrials. This means that Ouster has more opportunities to expand into different streams of revenue.

They produce 11M0z of gold and 400KT of copper per annum.  They are the second largest gold producer and in the top 15 for copper production

The two pillars of owning $GOLD are:

1. inflation hedge
2. bad news hedge
3. **liquidity bubble implies money flow into funds rather than out of the system!  Hence, why puts are irrelevant in a liquidity bubble.**

The reason you should buy them as a hedge are because they produce a 400KT of copper, so their cost of production of gold is the lowest in the industry.

In fact, last quarter @ 3.00 /lb copper and 1900/oz gold they had a free cash flow of 1.2 Billion USD in 1 quarter!

Copper has gone up to 3.50/lb and expect to hit 4.00 going forward because of the EV boom.

Other than their FCF, what makes $GOLD a compelling call buy is that gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and risk.  But now we have a liquidity bubble, so fund of flows will eventually move into gold.

Currently the fund of flows are QQQ > IWM growth into value.  Eventually, they'll move from value into inflation hedges (commodities/mining stock and gold).  This is why you want to buy $GOLD LEAP as a hedge and start positioning into it before the market makers (MM).

Right now, everyone is owning EV or ARKG but when that changes, they'll look for alternatives, but with stock prices at an All Time High, you'll likely see them chase gold by the middle of 2021._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLRT Going to ATH today. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey, there’s a first time for everything… _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Team GME checking in for takeoff 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BUY PTON _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME target $50 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I made a music video (rap) about my time on this sub _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RC ventures rise up!

Hello again, GME Tribe. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!

And an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).  

Now Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?

Anyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. 

Now, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. 

First thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.

Now, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. 

**Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**

Now, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.

So to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. But by all means run your manic ass over to the goddamn sound machine to get your viewers to munch on that big box stock.

Are you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere).

**Part 2****: GameStop Isn’t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**

So, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim – this story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.” 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) 

But Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.

No, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&amp;amp;amp;M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.

So fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: 

First, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) 

[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)

That’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) 

So now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?

Now, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.

**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads** 

And now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your fucking methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.

Now you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\_tribe\_a\_story\_about\_how\_ryan\_cohen\_is\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.

But here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.

There was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.

Now, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here. 

[http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)

But what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements."* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

I really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.

And now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:

\*\*\*

Bloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)

· "It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas," he says. "When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in." 

· Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”

· He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \[non-diversified\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”

· He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. "I don't want to swing for a single," he says.

\*\*\*

You hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.

Here’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:

\*\*\*

Forbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)

· “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”

· “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”

· “\[M\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”

· “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”

\*\*\*

Goddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.

But to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?

So where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592)  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.

Anyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):

*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*

We’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:

*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*

And now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison. Now everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.

But even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. First, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. 

**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**

Now, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\_cramer\_reveals\_dirty\_tricks\_short\_sellers\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)

[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)

So where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. 

So for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?

And I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do "because the SEC doesn't understand it." But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: 

[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.

I think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. 

Now I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. 

So maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.

In conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.

And Happy Holidays everyone.

\--CPT Hubbard

**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS. Probably even by early March, if that time is good for you (he’ll text before he comes).  And fuck infinite regress: It’s rockets all the way down here.  **🚀🚀🚀** Now: diamond hands, motherfuckers.

 **\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.

We also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.

But we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.

[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.

So, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don’t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn’t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it’s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn’t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don’t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn’t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don’t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.

Meanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.

We also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.

And one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

I found their institutional investors presentation from last week, sharing some slides as hedge funds don’t get a monopoly on this.

This might be a long one so TLDR at the bottom, and I’ve split this DD into sections.

# Context

Last week on the 16th, it was announced that AST SpaceMobile were going to be taken public via a SPAC (New Providence Acquisition Corp), for $1.4 Billion, the merger should happen in Q1 next year. They are a company who are building the **first** and **only**, space based, cellular broadband network to be accessible by any standard mobile phone. This considerably expands the reach and reliability of network provider’s mobile broadband coverage. Something traditional companies have tried to do but only with specialised hardware devices – connecting to smaller less powerful satellites.

https://preview.redd.it/me1kyphghx661.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=77acf3ce971645898f7bcbaf0bba4883d8361225

# Business Model

It only gets better from here, they already have signed commercial agreements with huge players such as Vodaphone, AT&T, Telefonica + many more firms who cover emerging markets like Indosat for Indonesia - This sums up to **1.3bn existing subscribers**. AST operate a business-to-business model, if an end user of one of these telecom companies loses coverage, they get notified if they want to use AST’s coverage to reconnect. This will be a surcharge and cost 1-2 USD a month for countries like India and revenue is split 50/50 between AST and the telecom company.

This offers two major benefits for telecom companies:

· Growth from adding extra value to subscribers

· Providing a differentiated service so reduces churn between providers

Since it is a low cost, efficient, wholesale model they’re targeting 90%+ EBITDA Margins. Either you're a provider who can offer unlimited coverage or you're not. This will be huge for emerging economies who don't have the infrastructure in place already.

# Valuation

As I am writing this, it’s trading about $12 which puts the EV/24E EBITDA at 1.7x, compared to comps of 13.3x.

https://preview.redd.it/eyxqzoshhx661.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4e8905382d31e879b8383228671fd834a29f24

To be trading inline with its comparable companies, the price should be **$51-77** after the merger.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aluwqx9tix661.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=72e91ee36f458ffb2103dbf1a2294047644212d6

Even a very bearish analysis would put the target price at $25-30. So what does this all mean? Well AST is incredibly attractive price right now, and its climbing, the last two days have seen a 20% increase in price as investors start really jumping into the SPAC because of this.

# Investment Thesis

There is a lot of appetite for this, being first to market with no competitors gives a huge advantage, already having agreements/partnerships in place means that they’re hitting the ground running. Patents and high barriers to entry will restrict direct competitors from being able to compete for a substantial period. The deal will go live in Feb-March next year so lets get rich and get in before it takes off.

**TLDR**

AST SpaceMobile is going public via a SPAC in 1Q 21 (SPAC is trading now). It’s the first and only company to offer space based, cellular broadband that will work with the existing Iphone you’re reading this off now – no extra hardware or software needed. They already have 1.3bn subscribers via partnered telecom companies and are targeting the 51% of the global population without any coverage. Price is now $12 but should be $50-70 to be inline with comparable comps. Deal announced last week and its getting hot. Jump in early and 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 .

The SPAC’s ticker is NP(A)

Reached one billion agreement with LG South Korea-based LG Electronics and automotive supplier Magna International are launching a joint venture that will make key components for electric cars, the companies announced on Wednesday.

The joint venture, tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain and valued at $1 billion, will manufacture e-motors, inverters and onboard chargers, according to LG Electronics.

The deal expands a wave of consolidation among suppliers aiming to capture a growing market for electric vehicle, e-axle systems, which combine electric motors, power controls and driving gears in one unit.

Trump is turning out to be a big ally for the dems using his 'art of the deal' techniques to bomb the republican party by asking for higher stim payments to individuals (which Pelosi quickly agreed to).

The polls are close as hell and it looks like it's a coinflip.

Why does this matter?

Look what happened to pot stocks when biden won the presidency. That will happen again if the dems win the senate race because it means we will have federally decriminalized pot in 2021. If you were in pot stocks before the election, you know how much money we made. If you weren't, you missed the fuck out.

Look at the picture. See the giant spike in november? That was the election erection.

Pot stocks have backed off their recent highs and IV is at the lowest it will be prior to the election. Now is the time to get in. You want gamble? Buy Jan 18th calls. Buy them out of the money. Buy a lot of them. If the dems lose, they will drop to 0. If the dems win, your calls will enter valhalla.

This is a goddamn gamble so my calls are short term and OTM at a few different strikes.

Preliminary trials showed an efficacy over 50%, with the results being announced by the Butantan Institute of São Paulo, Brazil today. It will supply most of South America, Russia and Asia’s vaccine demand. 46million vaccines already ordered by the Brazilian Government, with room for an increase to 150million. The Indonesian government already has placed an order for 32 million vaccines. Sinovac is a Chinese company, and the CCP are relying on them to produce these vaccines. The Eastern nations would place a total order of 3 billion vaccines. If efficacy is above 90%, which is the most desirable result, then you could see Dynavax skyrocket.

Obligatory Rocket Emojis:   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀 

I will get straight to the point, $LMND and $ROOT are both insurance companies, but have drastically different business models. $LMND has mooned to all-time highs while $ROOT has fallen to lows and in this DD I will compare both and show you that $ROOT is better.

**Business Models:**

Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a persons driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car.  This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.

Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance, nothing new, no moat. The only thing "tech" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So this brings me to my next point: valuations.

**Valuations:**

Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade was a tech company and Root wasnt. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no its literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. Is this opposite year or something?

**TLDR AND THE PLAY:**

Lemonade is a boomer company in disguise but has high valuation while a tech company like Root is does not. Root 20C Any exp before April ( thats when lock up ends). Free tendies.

POS: 20C 19 Feb 21

according to https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities gamestop has been on the threshold list every single day since december 8th.

and then according to https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm (there is some basic info on short selling as well): "In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency **must immediately purchase shares** to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” **if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days**."

does this regulation apply in this case? where is the catch? surely market makers would be aware of this and wouldn't be outsmarted by some autists here.

I'm too much of an autist myself to understand the full picture, anyone care to enlighten me?

Position : 800 shares at 16.5_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming & Easy Put Opportunity $$$ I put together the below DD for retards in bullets so you retards could easily follow. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a tremendous Put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.

&#x200B;

* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:

1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.
2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.
3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.

* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.
   * Snow CEO makes $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this
* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.
   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market
* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.
* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.
* Since my balls don't drag on the ground when I walk, I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. Positions below, $10k in each.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.

This shit company has worse seller support than Amazon, shadier sellers than craigslist, and more stupid users than facebook.  

Let me tell you something:  This shit company has the best policies to keep prices low on their platform.  They lock sellers from being able to raise their own set prices 'too much' (like 10%) within a 4 month period.  Not only that but they run this gimmick where they 'promote' your products for you --  guess what --  you can't make any financial changes to your products (except making it lower).

Then to top it off their scheme pricing is fucking atrocious. (fake numbers) Sell your item for $20 with $5 shipping?  For some reason the product is now listed for $30 on their site.  These assclowns decide to raise your price and keep the difference??   It looks to be their [policy](https://merchantfaq.wish.com/hc/en-us/articles/205211297-Why-have-our-displayed-prices-changed-on-Wish-).

They are a legit Tier-1 EV supplier with $40B in revenue (yet only a $19.9b market cap) that is a top contender to partner with AAPL. News just broke tonight as I was typing this up of Magna creating a $1B joint venture with LG electronics to make EV gear ([https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC](https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC)). Oh and options are dirt cheap, with implied volatility currently around 35 and a low company valuation (only  \~1/2x revenue and under 10x forward P/E). This is still early innings for this play. Some key points about Magna:

•	Has already had prior discussions with AAPL regarding outsourcing their vehicles ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/))

•	Prototype that MGA supplied to AAPL in 2012 looks very similar to AAPLs current prototype ([https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/))

•	Boomers are catching wind of it, picture below is from today

•	Fisker (FSR) recently announced they will use Magna’s EV platform for their upcoming Ocean SUV. Magna has warrants for 6% equity stake in FSR. Fisker’s market cap is currently \~$4.4b, implying Magna’s stake is worth north of $250m.

•	Invested in Waymo (Google’s self-driving car program) alongside other top-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake and partnered with Waymo on their first factory

•	Very active in core autonomous technologies and is first to market with solid-state LiDAR ([https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider](https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider))

•	Makes the Jaguar i-Pace since 2018 (Waymo placed order for 20,000 vehicles plus 20,000 other vehicles sold)

**Financials/Stock:**

•	Currently at 52-week high

•	Market cap just under $20B with $38B revenue

•	Operating cash flow more than doubled in last quarter to $1.6B

•	Trades for under 10x forward P/E

**How this trade goes right:**

•	Perception of potential AAPL partnership drives share price up, already has good momentum

•	Actual AAPL partnership sends this to the moon

•	Fisker goes on a run and MGA benefits from equity stake

•	Low implied volatility gives this trade very good risk:reward

•	Valuation multiple “catches up” to comparable EV suppliers

**Risks and mitigants:**

•	Current market conditions erode, causing a broad market selloff. This risk is low over the next year given the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low at least until 2023-2024 and pumping billions of dollars’ worth of liquidity into the market each day (incl. purchases of corporate bonds and junk debt).

•	AAPL partnership doesn’t materialize. Apple’s exclusive leak to Reuters highlights the tech giant’s intent to produce cars. While I think Magna is in the pole position to win business from AAPL, Magna already has a robust business that will grow well next year without any AAPL revenue. Magna’s relatively cheap valuation vs. peers gives the stock plenty of runway without AAPL hype.

Some of you may have seen Needham analyst Laura Martin (same analyst who called FUBO early) mention on CNBC today that it is her top stock pick for 2021 and could run up 500% when asked by the hosts (I think that's a stretch). Her pick caused MGNI to run up another 17% after hours.

IT IS STILL NOT TOO LATE TO GET IN. In fact, you are early. This is going to keep running, here is why:

We are just starting to see advertisers open up their budgets for Programmatic Advertising more and more. You've heard of cord cutting, right? You know you don't watch shit cable TV or at least don't want to anymore, right? Well, your favorite apps or shows on Connected TV (AppleTV, FireTV, Hulu, Netflix etc etc) are just beginning to work in advertising spots on their free programming. Magnite is the one who sells alot of those ads for massive clients (exclusive agency for Disney Hulu and Discovery Networks) and they will absolutely add more partners. This is just the beginning. I would say we are 30% of the way into adoption from big brand advertisers (they can also serve small-mid brands).

In addition, the technology they have processes super targeted ads in real time. This is much better for advertisers than what they got on linear TV. These advertisers have to follow the audience. They have no choice but to spend their money on CTV ads and the younger generations are ditching the cable box completely. This is like investing into the ad agencies that got huge at the inception of the television. BIG MONEY. Lots of room to grow.

Magnite is also working closely with TTD (TradeDesk) to develop identity technology (think cookies) that is less intrusive to the user/consumer and more telling to the advertiser allowing them to target better and with less violation to the consumer's identity. SERIOUS tech. TTD is buying the ads for the big brand advertisers from MGNI who represents the sellers (Disney Hulu etc).

TTD has a $50B market cap. MGNI is sitting right around a $3B cap right now. You see where I am going here. This company will grow and probably quickly since they are leading the sell side (SSP) of the Programmatic TV industry right now. Happy to answer more for any of you who have questions.

Here is a great thread on Twitter that breaks down CTV/PTV, TTD and MGNI among others:

Please note that I will be referring to these 2 points in this DD, and maybe even throughout this DD series. These are the most important points that would form the foundation of my DD but they aren't the 'freshest' I apologize.

**1. Let me start by pointing out that most of us WSB autists are privileged. There exists the others, who actually make up the majority of the population** who/whose kids can’t afford to risk losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars making “educated guesses”/gambling the way we do.

As a group, it’s easy for us to confirm each other’s biases, forget about the rest and create our own echo chamber.

**2. Digital games is overtaking physical copies. This is true.**

SONY, EA, Take Two all have crossed a tipping point where more than half of their console games are now sold via download 51%, 52% and 55%

For Sony, it was up from 37% last year. (Source A)

Generally, the growth of digital vs discs seems to be quite even, so using SONY as an example, that’s a 38% increase (Yes. It’s a 14% difference, but it’s a 38% increase from 37% that takes it to 51%). That means GME’s going to experience apx 26% decrease YOY in sales.

\*\*BUT!\*\*The global console games market is expected to grow from $40.6 billion in 2019 to about $57.9 billion in 2020 (source B) That’s a 42.6% increase.

&#x200B;

[The numbers,](https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17)

**Young Mason:** This mean physical copies are dying! GME is DEAD!

Not quite. Actually, not at all. GME will definitely get a smaller percentage of the *console game pie*, but the pie itself has grown and they will actually end up with a larger slice.

**But wait, there’s more!** The research/stats was published in May. Did anyone project COVID will be as bad as it is now? Stay at home kids want to play games, meet desperate WFH parents that want a break. I am confident that the 2 factors push the numbers a lot higher than $57.90 Billion, but hey for now let’s just use that. Also remember, that % for digital games download vs physical is based on quantity including all the shit/old games they push for cheap and people buy out of boredom. Although the numbers aren’t reported solid, the consensus is, is that more disc consoles are sold because people want to play their old disc games. Even at a modest 50/50, we’re locked in more or less until the next console cycle.

\*\*But wait, there’s even more!\*\*So the console pie has grown 42.6%. You know what else has grown and is growing?

Gaming overall! Mobile, PC, even board games, they’ve all been growing. Checkout Gamestop’s website.

They’ve been getting into phones, computer parts and board games. It’s not out of desperation. It is the right move as Gamestop is really establishing its brand as one stop shop for games. When you think building supplies, you think Home Depot. Soon, when you think games, you will think Gamestop.

Gamestop is already set up for used games/devices trading like no one else. Phones are super liquid and high in demand (This isn't anything serious YET, I will cover this in another DD). Did I tell you that the digital consoles are now more tradable/rentable too? No moving parts = very low risk of damage other than drops/spills. Keep an eye on this. Remember the point #1.

Carrying computer parts also shield them from any sort of lockdown possibility because computer parts are essential. Bigger pie, and more pies.

**What you are saying makes sense… but bro, don’t you remember Q3 earnings?**

Yes, I do…Bro. They had a decrease in revenue. Do you remember Q3 was for August, September, October?

Were you really thinking about video games back then? We were all out there seeing friends, partying, enjoying nature thinking either Covid was gone and it was renaissance or thinking second wave is coming, and we have to enjoy it while it lasts.

**Establishing its brand? Are you nuts? People hate GME.**

Yes. **We do**. We all have that bitter memory. We remember the day when we or our friend went to GME to literally get hustled as a noob kid like we remember going to the strip club to get hustled as a noob adult.

Remember, we are ALL 18\~40+, ‘privileged’ minority. (Point#1).Peak gaming target demographics is around 13\~25.

Right now, GME is putting trade value of all games online, updated daily and it isn’t as ‘hustly’ as it used to be. This is a simple change, but powerful. People now know exactly what to expect, and they’d only bring in the games/consoles when they see the money/credit is worth more for them.

Results? Happier transactions on both ends, and better branding moving forward.

They’ve also been spending a lot more on advertising for brand recognition. That recognition will soon put them in a spot where they are the only one that can organize e-sports/gaming tournaments in the western world in any meaningful way.

I will leave you with this. The majority (Point #1) isn’t so lucky to start blowing money at the launch of a new console. Where can the majority go to fill their increased gaming needs while being fiscally conservative during this pandemic? eBay? With all the shipping delays?

Like how Amazon is eating eBay’s breakfast but eBay will always have its market share in ecommerce, GME will always have its place in gaming at the very least.

**Tomorrow I will tell you why GME will crush Amazon and not the other way around, and also touch up on either what their current valuation means to Cohen, or the future of gaming.**

Don’t worry, I’m even going to cover Stadia at one point too.

Edit: Positions:  My position on GME is made up of shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example let’s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but that’s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If it’s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it’s 18.8.  

That’s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren’t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if it’s not a short squeeze, and that’s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don’t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He’s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn’t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That’s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn’t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn’t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don’t be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO is an absolute monster and MGNI was picked to be next today On this sector Needham and Laura Martin have been dialed in.

My positions: $40k in stock_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why JOE won't slow-- how this stock is primed to double in 2021 Let's start things off by saying that The St. Joe company is hot right now. [After the promising Q3 that was promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiiw0q/joe_to_obliterate_earnings_wednesday_on_sale_today/), JOE has risen a whopping 42 percent over the past month. I am here to tell you why that trend won't be changing anytime soon.

&#x200B;

The St. Joe Company is a land development company headquartered in Watersound, Florida, and are currently the second biggest private owners of land in FL (177,000 acres). What makes JOE stand out from the crowd is that they stand on the precipice of a once in a lifetime bull run when considering all of the bullish cases: An absolutely glamorous forward projections of sales, their control of Walton County, the mass migration from city to suburb, the bullish case for real estate in the US as a whole, and as a hedge against inflation. Additionally, JOE sits at an impressive 96.85 percent institutional ownership, with additional share buybacks planned.

&#x200B;

JOE is currently in a spectacular position, growth-wise. After years of sitting on empty lots and middling growth, The St. Joe Company has found itself now generating a decent cash flow and is reinvesting the profits heavily back into its developments. JOE's latest lots have sold almost instantly at 100 percent margin. With JOE's land ownership being concentrated to specific regions (Florida panhandle/Walton County especially), they stand to gain immensely from the recent growth of residents as their counties/towns transform from ghost towns relying on tourist revenue to legitimate communities with a more productive economy. Take a look at JOE's Q3 earnings update video showcasing their newest developments [here](https://youtu.be/ije46j7Tc4k). As you can see, that is a fuck ton of homes, apartments, and commercial buildings being built on beautiful panhandle land.

&#x200B;

I wanted to specifically touch on JOE's control of Walton County due to its importance in JOE's future growth. Walton County is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation (4.58% increase this year), and JOE holds almost all of the salable land that remains. Development of these lands into bustling commercial and residential properties is something JOE stands to gain from immensely, as this monopoly will allow them to profit in a huge way. Florida will not stop growing for a long while, and JOE is prepped to build the future of the panhandle and will certainly attract much more attention in the following year as they start reporting their record growth and projections. For the reasons listed (and the implied reasoning that wasn't explained such as hedging against inflation and the bullish case for real estate), I easily see JOE hitting somewhere in the 90-100 range by Q3 next year. This is a stock that, today, still provides great value to investors willing to hold for at least a couple months while investors price in JOE's forward growth along with the near certainty of Florida remaining a booming growth state for years to come.

Our world is becoming more shitty and you all are becoming older, fatter, and more lazy. This I believe suits the demographic spot on and will eventually drive more volume into the market. If you take a look at the Technical Analysis, you can obviously see (with your wise trader intelligence) various bullish trends forming.

Comparing the US dollar to the Linden will one day be a joke, watching your money burn in value the past years won't do anything for you in the future. With Second lifes minimal fees+tax, this currency is looking to compete against bitcoin by 2030. There is no reason for you to not convert to the second life linden.

International EV manufacturers have collectively shot to the moon this year. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued (e.g., steel, as recently popularised on this dumbass sub). Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.

Ref 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)

**If you have not considered the lithium market yet, you should**. As manufacturing requirements for lithium rise (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry.

I draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining & exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km² of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of £9m, trading at p0.08/share.** The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.

**🚀**  **🚀** The current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, which is expected in a matter of weeks. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will carry my autistic fucking nut to Pluto. They also hold gold mining permits in Mali and Côte d'Ivoire which will shore up the share price. Definitely worth a look at. **🚀**  **🚀**

Green tendies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICLN TO THE FKN MOON 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What's your minimum stock volume to risk buying options? 10 mill? 5 mill? 1 mill? 500k+/-? So for options gamblers, what is the minimum volume you have to have to even consider buying options for a stock.

Generally for short or longer short term (less than 3 months) and even longer I don't really like going below 1 million because I may need a quick escape to stop losses or avoid bot manipulation.

If a company is rather popular despite low volume, or used to be huge previously, and in a sector that's up, I may go in with 500k To 900k volume. Especially if there's occasional news about the company instead of uninformative autoblogs.

But I generally need at least 1 million. Some people however won't go below 5 million or 20.

What's your minimum volume before you take a risk on buying options for a security?

Well, I'm sure as shit not making money, so let me take all my tax deductions and put them in with the rest of my shitpile of a financial outlook, you cocks. Please join me in sending them an e-mail protesting the ability to centralize all of my suffering.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ End of the World for GME Bears | 2012 🎮 🎮🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME to da moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First FireEye(FEYE), now it's SolarWinds(SWI). Anyone thinking of picking SWI up? So the attack on FEYE was thought to be by the same org/nation-state that did SWI. FEYE crashed 13% on news and now up 45% from PRE-CRASH value(66% post-crash value.) Anyone thinking this gonna be the same for SWI? 

Main Product: https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion
Clients: https://fortune.com/2020/12/15/solarwinds-hackers-u-s-agencies/

300k clients including all gov branches and 80% of F500. Product is highly highly sticky since it is integrated into customers' IT system(in order to have God-eye monitoring) and take a long time to switch. I read somewhere that F500's SAP digital transformation take more than a year and a few million $ so there is no way SWI will be something easy to remove. Thoughts?


https://redd.it/khpr5v : /r/sysadmin made a poll about whether admins would switch and 50% say NO. This is an underestimation since this event is still very fresh in people mind and Redditors are known to be quite anal about Tech & Security. I think it's unlikely SWI will suffer long term damage(have not seen any tech comp losing long-term due to security breach.)

Here with your daily update on the steel situation. Get your shit packed because we're heading to the moon for some juicy fucking tendies Q1 2021.

&#x200B;

Because I can't put it into better words myself, here are some direct quotes from the article:

&#x200B;

**Quotes of the day**

"Availability remains extremely limited," one sheet consumer said. "There is so little spot HRC available that the price just pretty much changes on each shipment." 

Said a service center source: "For the first time in the history of our company, we have submitted steel orders with no pricing on the orders. We are being told to place orders, to hold the production time and we will be told of the pricing shortly. In the short term, I believe there will be hurt feelings between suppliers and customers."   

And a second distributor said: "Mills are so far behind, I think they don’t want to overcommit on an already robust book. We see no chance for a breather on pricing until March. Crazy end to a crazy year."

&#x200B;

$MT's PT continues to receive upgrades from various investors with each passing day. We're seeing all-time highs with respect to the price of steel. Unfortunately for those who need it, steel is expensive and in high demand - but this is fantastic news for us fucking autists.

Historically, we're seeing some of the lowest interest rates being offered by banks and these rates are likely to stay until 2023. This bodes perfectly as infrastructure projects are all financed (who the fuck has $10B in cash to complete a construction project!?!?!).

Either way, I'll shut up and post my position:

I'll see you all on the moon 🚀🚀🚀
