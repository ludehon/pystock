Hi All,

I debated if I should make this post but I thought it might help one or two new kids who are new to investing. If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it.

At the beginning of 2020 I was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020: \[Apparently I can't post screen shot here. I've the screenshot posted on my profile\] 

**Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**

My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago, you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time.

**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**

My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93, I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him.

**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**

If you haven't deleted R0binh00d and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs, crashes, service outages, your data being sold, .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here.

**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**

If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong, then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you, even if you disagree with them.

**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**

CNBC, Bloomberg, ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment.

**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**

I used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring, right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks, being banned, DDs being deleted, ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing, economics, .... I got temporary banned here, and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now, and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops.

**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**

Most people including me already know this, but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy

**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**

Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME, Palantir, and such.

**Lesson 9: Reddit is skews the information you see**

Not all the best ideas are popular and not all the popular ideas are good. lol

**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**

Popularized by WB, he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens, and I guarantee you there will be a correction, then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction, pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh

**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**

LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so.

**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**

You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one, in my opinion you are wasting your time.

**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.**

Those who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as "always do this and you will win". Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x, y and z and you will make money, that's total BS.

**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**

You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys, buy coke, or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment, buy a car for the ones who really need them,... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life, not on options.

**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction, you won't get the results that matter**

You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red, you gotta have conviction in your thesis.

What do y’all think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RLH (Red Lion Hotels Corp.) to be acquired and taken private, but is also now being investigated Red Lion Hotels Corporation (RLH) jumped almost 30% on Thursday 12/31 on takeover news, but is now also going to be investigated by two law firms to see whether the acquisition agreement was fair and really in the best interest of the shareholders.

Thoughts on this? Could this be really bad for the stock (i.e. could it drop to levels below the pre-acquisition announcement) if the investigations uncover something?

Personally, I think the acquisition price of $3.50/share is too low when compared to where RLH has been in non-recession times.  Historically (over 23 years), RLH has generally traded above $5 a share, except in the 2008 recession, and this COVID-19 recession. Granted, there had been financial turmoil within RLH in the few of months leading up to the pandemic (which resulted in the ouster of its CEO), but it seems like the board is just throwing in the towel at this point and not patient enough to see its turnaround strategy be implemented and in action post-pandemic.

I’m looking into Corbus Pharmaceuticals ($CRBP) after seeing how it plunged from $9 to about $1.25 after the two phase III clinical tests they did failed to show any positive results. 

Doing a bit more research, I saw that they recently filed for a patent on 12/31 for “Treatment with ajulemic acid that results in a dose-dependent decrease in the occurrence of acute pulmonary exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics when compared to placebo. A 75% reduction was observed in the 48 week rate of acute pulmonary exacerbations in subjects treated with ajulemic acid at 20mg BID”

My question: How often do pharmaceutical companies file patents like this and is this something that’s worth having high hopes for? I’m assuming this happens all the time in the industry and I know it’s just them filing an application (rather than getting it approved) but I was curious to hear any other investors’ opinions on how much weight they put into news like this and what other aspects on pharma related companies they look for? I usually just invest in the MJ sector and am pretty new to this sector. I think it’s worth noting that this company is studying cannabinoids and is the reason I came across it as well lol. Also, their pipeline of new drugs is pretty small right now which I know is not good/ideal but figured I’d take a look and see what y’all thought!

I am planning on investing in Brookfield Renewable & Brookfield Infrastructure stocks for the long term. 

However, the recent share splits made me confused. 
See, BIPC is outperforming BIP, and BEPC is outperforming BEP. 

Meanwhile, the dividend yield is higher for the partnerships than the C-corps.

I'm confused as to which stock to buy. 
Aren't the two stocks supposed to be equivalent? Why do they have such different performance?
 I don't want to buy the C-corp and have a risk of valuation (since it is more overvalued than the partnership)
I also don't want to buy the partnership and miss out on future gains, since the C-corp seems to be more popular..

Could someone clarify for me as to which stock should I buy?
Because quite honestly, I'm thinking about avoiding all of Brookfield's stocks because of all the confusion.

I'm in the process of backtesting a new price action breakout strategy, but I'm not sure how to accurately measure its success. I've managed to collect over 8 months of minute data for the S&P100 to test against and was originally averaging the profit percent of each ticket. This was a horrible way to measure it and lead to all kinds of errors. 

From there I learned about APPT (average profitability per trade). I averaged the wins, losses, and profits from all the tickers before calculating it, but even then I'm not sure what a successful value should be (other than +good, -bad). 

Using a $100k initial investment I was able to make 70k trades with an APPT of $25. The W/L ratio was 3:1. 

I was also able to tweak my strategy to make 30k trades at $20 APPT and the same initial investment and W/L of 3:1. 

Is the second strategy better because even though it has a lower APPT but the number of trades is cut in half? This could mean more simultaneously trades assuming the right conditions are met?

What is consider a good APPT value and what other success measurements do you all use?

Note: My 70k and 30k trades are assuming I could make every possible trade across all 143 tickers. I would at best only be able to combine a hand full at a time (averaging ~500 trades per ticker)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Roth IRA contributions Hey!

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How is the opening price of NASDAQ pre-market determined Hey guys,

i was wondering how the opening price of NASDAQs pre-market, or maybe any pre-market, is determined,

I would guess that all orders filed before pre-market open are summed up and put into effect at once, the resulting share price will be the pre-market open price.

For example 10k shares are bought and 5k are sold resulting in a increased share price at open.

&#x200B;

The other option i could imagine is that all orders will be processed  consecutively in order of the filing date and time.

This would imply, that a stop loss order could trigger even though the opening price will be above the set limit of the stop loss.

**"Okay, but where do I start?"**

*I was asking myself this same question only 10 months ago. So, do not automatically assume that you are laps behind. For the past ten years, I focused on just allocating a portion of each paycheck towards my retirement account. I focused on keeping it simple and stuck to low-cost index funds. Mostly, because I am unable to invest in individual stocks in my government retirement account. With that said, low-cost index funds are the most assured way to secure a nice retirement. The only thing you need is a few decades of continued contributions and growth. I found myself wanting something else though. I did not want to wait to retire in my sixties.*

*This is where I shifted my goals a bit. I wanted to focus on building up an investment portfolio, which I could access at any time. I opened a brokerage account so I could eventually live off it, much like my 401K, but could start relying on 20 years earlier. I still contribute to my 401k, but the goal is to not need it.*

**Road Map:** 

*You must be ready to change your beliefs. There are endless of ways to invest and many of those ways can be the right way.* 

**How I currently see my investment road map is this:**

*Next 12 years invest in companies that:*

&#x200B;

* *Small to medium market cap*
* *Very high growth*
* *Software as a Service modeled company*

*From years 12-15 transition in companies that:*

&#x200B;

* *Medium to large market cap*
* *Dividend companies or,*
* *High growth*

This map could easily change, based on too many factors to count. Instead of the next 12 years, I could keep my approach now well into the future. I could end up being burned by one too many companies and grow to be more conservative. You just must be willing to adapt.

***Philosophy:***

**How many companies?**

*There is no golden rule I follow when it comes to the number of companies, I hold at one point in time. I try to stick somewhere between 15-25, because it is easier for me to really keep up with these companies from top to bottom at this amount.*

**Ideal market cap?**

*Less than 25 Billion is where I would like to be for each holding. Typically, I focus on companies in the single-digit billions, but if a company continues to grow at a high rate, I stay in my position until the revenue growth declines by a reasonable amount.*

**What type of companies?**

C*loud based subscription modeled companies. This means that the company is usually a SaaS one. Software as a Service (SaaS). They offer small, medium, large, and enterprise customers certain services on a subscription model. The stickier the service the better. If the type of service is one that becomes hard to live without, the company can sell additional add-ons and improvements to the company. The subscriptions are usually done annual, so it is easy to see revenue floor of the companies. So, the growth would be accelerated by the additional new customers that are brought in.*

*I also do not mind e-commerce companies (Shopify, Etsy, Pinterest, etc.) and sometimes a bio tech company here and there.*

How long do I hold a company?

*It is quite flexible, but If I see two consecutive quarters of growth declined earnings… I put my money to work in a better vehicle.*

**Building the portfolio:** 

*I originally started with 10 companies and made them all 10% each of my portfolio. I felt that it was straight forward and that the cream would rise to the top and make up a larger percentage of my holdings. My beginning balance was no great amount, either.*   
 *The companies were:*

1. The Trade Desk

2. Etsy

3. Datadog

4. Fastly

5. Alteryx

6. Crowdstrike

7. Roku

8. Appian

9. Elastic

10. Zoom

*I still own all of these companies, aside from Alteryx. I put very little more into any of these companies. I want to make the company do the hard work. I want their performance to grow my account… not more of my own money. I only add more money to accounts when I see a large collapse of share price for no fault of the company (Covid).*

**New companies?**

*For new companies, I limit the size of the position to 1-3% of my portfolio’s current size. Overtime they will grow and be worth more than that percentage of my portfolio and if not, the risk was minimized, and I move on. I do not focus on share price because these are typically small cap companies with large runways and just because something is 900 dollars a share, does not mean it cannot hit 3000 dollars a share.*

Most people are entering 2021 with a huge sense of optimism following the release of several vaccines, as well as the new Democratic President.

However, for investors, there are still a lot of risks left up in the air from 2020. Valuations continue to be sky high without any meaningful pullback, which was a large concern even in 2019. Sectors such as Clean Energy have seen huge run ups in anticipation of a friendlier government, but it remains to be seen how easy it will be for those companies to deliver those expectations. Genomics has seen a recent surge in popularity, however the timeframe for widespread adoption is still way off into the future. This is to name but a few things to be wary of at this time.

So with an exciting new year for investing just beginning, /r/stocks, which stock do you consider to be your most high risk / high reward play going into 2021 and why?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aventures in Investing: In and out of $BYND and realizing the dangers of YouTube hype Finance blog adventures in investing: So I had gotten all hyped related to Financial Education Jeremy’s 10x video on Beyond Meat, $BYND. I thought Beyond was an exciting company, and an interesting stock, and I had just seen the stock price drop after they reported Q3 earnings. But I hadn’t decided to buy the stock, and it looked like FEJ had and he got in at about the bottom after earnings. “He’s a genius!” I thought… So I liked his bull thesis, I added it to my watchlist, and I watched and watched and watched… and finally on a day it pulled back like 5% I got in! I was going to start building my position. And then it kept dropping. And on another day it finally got back to the price that FEJ had gotten it, so I doubled down! But then I started getting nervous. Why had they missed earnings? What reasons did they give? FEJ didn’t even talk about it in his video. Well I checked out their last conference call, every publicly traded company gives out a summary of their finances every quarter and holds a question and answer session on a call. 

And then I found out. They missed huge. And the reasons they gave… because of “freezer stuffing” (I’m paraphrasing), during the grocery panic in Q2 related to Covid… customers didn’t buy as much in Q3, because they had already bought so much and they were storing it. Okay… Oh, and the reason that they didn’t “participate” in takeout was because restaurants had slimmed down their menus and didn’t include their products. Okay… Oh and they declined to issue guidance for Q4. So on the call you’ll see every time an analyst asks if they see their situation improving they would just reply “we are not issuing guidance at this time.” 

And then finally, there is this whole thing going on w/ McDonald’s, where they’re debuting the “McPlant.” Which was maybe a collaboration with Beyond, but they’re not publicly saying it… and Beyond wants their brand represented on the menu but McDonalds won’t even confirm that they are partnering with them, only that they had helped them test products at some point blah blah blah. 

So after learning all of this I thought it was pretty disingenuous of FEJ to not disclose these details in his video. To me it means that uncertainty and risk in Beyond stock is HIGH AF rn. Fortune favors the brave, so if you’re entering here and they turn things around, I think you could build a kick-ass position. But you need a reason to be faithful. Why do you think they’re going to turn it around in the near term? Because if they miss again, that stock price is going to fall again hard. Not to mention, you look at their financials and they are not currently profitable, and the stock is already being given a generous price multiple, etc. 

And finally, I was low on cash. And $BYND looks thirsty. IMO if you’re going to enter a risky stock, you gotta be ready to average down. You gotta have water. If you got no water then what you really want in the stock market is a cactus 🌵. So I’m out of $BYND stock for now. I also go out of $ABNB for similar reasons on the same day. Both interesting stocks and interesting companies and I hope to get back in at a later date. 

Happy new year!!!
