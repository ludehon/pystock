 GME winners - remember to give back, I'll start Congrats you degenerates, you finally beat The Man and you're swimming in tendies. This was a fun ride and it's probably not over yet, but I'm hopping off the train with over a million dollar gain. 

Here's the fun part - while I never thought I'd make this much on the trade, when I entered it I promised my Maker I'd give 20% of whatever gains I had to charity and folks affected by the pandemic. I thought maybe it would be $10k or maybe $20k - who knows, $50k if shit got wild. 

So far, post taxes it's around $150k. Wow. We researched charities in our area and I found one that focuses on preventing evictions and helping kids in crisis. We called them this week to tell them what we plan to drop by next week and they were shocked. It costs a lot less to keep a family in their current home than to find them a new one, and in a lot of places, the average eviction is over less than a thousand bucks. They estimate this will keep 100 families in their homes - the majority of whom have kids under 5.

I don't want give up privacy or too many details here and you can ban me for that if you want ( you can see I mentioned this plan in an earlier comment a few weeks ago) , but there are a ton of eyes on this sub and this community right now - let's show the world that we're not the 'dumb money' and we do good when we do well.

I encourage everyone who made bank on this to make a donation to a local charity as there's a lot of need right now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You Idiots Helped Me Make 2 Years of Passive Income in One Day I've been in the stock market for a few years mostly playing blue chips and S&P500 ETFs. 5% was a great day for me in the past. I averaged about 20% returns yearly .

After browsing this forum and doing some DD on PLTR,  GME and CCIV., I got into them for about 25% of my portfolio. I've always tried to stay away from "hype stocks" but I took my time and dove into something I was a bit uncomfortable with. 

Well fast forward to today..

I'm up 29% on PLTR, 58% on GME and 60% on CCIV. 

I don't even know what to say. This is probably the biggest success in my stock market career and I wouldn't have heard about them without WSB.

Blackberry is like that glorious team that won everything in the past and then got beaten so bad that it disappeared into the oblivion.. They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. 

Recently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. 
 
First Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.
 
 
Now who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? 
 
So this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.
 
Here is how it happened. 
 
Most car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It’s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can’t process much.  
 
QNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It’s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It’s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.
This is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. 

Why didn’t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?

Because they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It’s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It’s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn’t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.
 
They now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. 

Neymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. 

Even when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. 
 
Amazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It’s publicity.. A charity game. 



1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)

2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.

3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.

4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)

5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android. (Fact)

I think its fair to say that Blackberry is going to be a $ 100 Bn company.. it’s imminent. 

They will now have a Tesla run.. they will have a Fiverr kind of run or Cloudflare._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀 thanks for the retard encouragement. I'm new to inventing, but have had a good 10 months.

8:00a ET 1/18/2021 - Globe Newswire
H2O Innovation Builds Momentum, Signing $3.2 M in New Industrial and Wastewater Contracts
Mentioned:	HEOFF
(TSXV: HEO) - H2O Innovation Inc. ("H2O Innovation" or the "Corporation") is proud to announce it was awarded the engineering contract on a capital equipment project for the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the US, as well as four new municipal and industrial capital equipment projects. These new contracts, totaling $3.2 M, will bring the Corporation's Water Technologies & Services ("WTS") sales backlog to $37.1 M.

"Our WTS business has been very active, and their efforts are highlighted by the recent wave of projects we have captured, keeping our WTS backlog very healthy. With our business model, the projects we execute often also lead to opportunities for our other business units down the line", stated Frederic Dugre, President and Chief Executive Officer of H2O Innovation.

The Corporation has secured the engineering contract to design two identical reverse osmosis ("RO") trains, each rated at 2,200 m/day, for an electric vehicle manufacturing plant located in Texas. Upon successful completion of the engineering work, a purchase order for construction and delivery of the equipment should be issued to the Corporation.

The first project is for an upgrade of the 7,500 m/day Granbury Wastewater South Plant, in Granbury, Texas. The existing conventional activated sludge plant will be converted to a membrane bioreactor (MBR) facility with biological phosphorus removal. The new equipment builds on the plant's current infrastructure, reducing the capital cost, and the upgrade is designed using the Corporation's innovative flexMBR(TM) universal membrane system, which reduces lifecycle cost.

The next project awarded to H2O Innovation is for a redesign and replacement of a failing MBR system at a school in the State of Maryland. The Corporation has been selected to make the necessary repairs and improve the durability of the wastewater system using ceramic membranes.

The third project, an exciting first for H2O Innovation, is the award of a demonstration pilot for its novel SILO technology at an industrial customer in the Midwest US. The SILO platform was developed in-house as a simplified approach to MBR treatment for smaller applications and decentralized treatment facilities where installation costs, ease of operation, and low maintenance are key differentiators.

Finally, H2O Innovation has secured a contract in Southern California for the supply of two RO demonstration units at the Hyperion Water Reclamation facility for long-term testing and public outreach. Each unit will be capable of producing up to 134 m/day treating secondary MBR filtrate. This project reinforces the Corporation's presence and experience in the critical water reuse market.

According to Mr. Dugre, "We continue to put our efforts into capturing more wastewater, water reuse, and industrial opportunities, characterized by higher gross profit margins, and expanding our presence in Texas, which is a strategic market for us".

1. Blackberry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market (These include Sony, Hyundai, Apple, Ford & more)
2. Blackberry has a new relationship with AWS (Amazon's giant cloud business), for Blackberry IVY for the EV market above
3. From the financial post - "BlackBerry sued Facebook in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its popular messaging applications. Facebook responded with a successful campaign to challenge BlackBerry patents and launched its own suit accusing BlackBerry of infringing patents for voice messaging technology.  On January 15 2021, BlackBerry Ltd. said it’s settled a dispute with Facebook Inc. over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed."
4. Blackberry is diversifying its revenue streams, it is also building its cybersecurity business. From the motley fool " In recent years, BlackBerry completely transformed its business, ditching smartphones for cybersecurity. Today, it has one of the best cybersecurity software portfolios on the planet. Its Cylance division, for example, can thwart attacks *before* they occur by deploying artificial intelligence networks that identify vulnerabilities in advance. "
5. Blackberry has approx. 38,000 patents in its portfolio dating back to when it was one of the biggest retailers of cell phones in the world. They recently sold 90 to Huawei and are coming to a settlement now with Facebook, although these may be immaterial transaction it speaks to the value of the patent portfolio. They are shifting their business away from retail phone sales and still can capitalize on their patent library.
6. BlackBerry [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-teams-up-with-desay-sv-automotive-to-enable-an-intelligent-and-safe-driving-experience-for-the-new-xpeng-p7-a-leading-level-3-autonomous-ev) that it will be powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng, one of the most-funded electric vehicle startups in China, and Tesla’s local challenger.

EDIT - Did a bit more research

**IN JOHN CHEN WE TRUST**

7.  BlackBerry Ltd. Chief Executive Officer John Chen signed a new contract worth at least US$128 million to keep him on the job for at least five years. The pay package includes 10 million restricted stock grants — valued at $128 million as of Wednesday’s close — that will vest through November 2023, the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said Thursday in a statement. Half will pay out if share-price goals of US$16 to US$20 are reached. He’ll also get a performance-based cash award if the stock hits US$30.

8. When better days come, we'll be ready to execute well: BlackBerry CEO 7 minutes of John Chen on BNN

New to this whole thing (up 25% on $2k in my first week, love you goddamn tards!), just got a notice today from Robinhood stating that if I bought and sold one more stock I would be turning off the Pattern Day Trade Protection setting which would put me at risk of needing $25k on hand at all times. 
How much should I worry about this? Is it an overstated position on their part or should I be diligent about not getting that setting turned off? They give you 3 same day buy/sells of a single stock before the 4th one turns off said protection (and the 3 stand for 5 days thereafter).

If I feel anything at all - im just pissed I will have to pay taxes on this. Has anyone thought about tax implications once we all agree its cool to sell to the boomers and let them hold the bags?

PLTR SQUAD RISE UP 🚀 🚀 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NEXT STOP, THE MOON!!!!!! 🚀🌕💎🙌🏻 🚀🌕💎🙌🏻 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🐻 take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody #I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION 

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A little more diversified than most of us autists, but I play the game hard... this is today’s gains and about a total of 2 weeks of GME, BB and FINALLY today, PLTR. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You are in all of our thoughts $GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Still has room to grow IF... We all saw the squeeze. I know all your wife's boyfriends are getting jealous at your new lambo. Enjoy.

There's a reason we stopped where we did. You're not going to like it. GME had the potential to reach fucking Alpha Centauri but there was one important thing making it hard.

Strikes.

The highest strike available to you retards was $60. At this point, no one is selling calls for anything above that because there IS nothing above that. WSB inadvertently did what was called a "Gamma squeeze" where basically MMs need to buy the underlying stock for every call contract they sell. You guys bought SO MANY FUCKING CALLS that the MMs had to cover their positions. They don't want to do this, but they had to.

But the calls stopped at 60. That's also roughly where the whole thing stopped. Yes, it went to 72. That was probably people continuing to buy shares but more than likely it was margin calls getting activated for a FEW short sellers. Others may come later. Some other short sellers may have closed themselves out earlier and newer, fresher meat came in (at new higher short prices.) The point is you see where it basically hovered once the day was done. Roughly $60. That's all it could do. 

But the gamma squeeze is what ended up happening here possibly in conjunction with a small short squeeze.

So how does it go up from here?

If whomever decides what options are available to buy adds more to the list, be it MMs, Options Clearing Corp, whomever does that shit. 70c, 80c, 100c, 150c. If they add more, and you people keep buying those moronicly stupid OTM contracts that we all know will make you rich, that's how you squeeze everyone.

This is also why BB shot up when GME was shut down. You guys IMMEDIATELY went in and bought EVERY damn call contract there was.

Buying 50k shares of GME will cost you a cool 3mil right now.

But you can make the MMs buy 50k shares and spend their 3mil by spending $100,000 on those 80c 1/29 contracts... If they show up on Monday.

If anything I said was wrong and you absolutely know better, please correct me. I'm asking nicely so be nice about it. We're all here to learn, despite us being retards that only say "strike date!!!1!11"

TL;DR: This was mostly a gamma squeeze. When you buy a contract from an MM you are forcing them to buy 100 shares of the underlying. When you do this with thousand of contracts across higher strikes you are forcing them to buy more and more. This is called a gamma squeeze. This is what you guys did the first squeeze (20 -> 35) and most of what you guys did for this squeeze. If more strike prices get added, it will blast off even further.

Adjusting TL;DR with this tidbit by u/FatCatBoomerBanker:
So, to fix your TL;DR, they don't have to buy the full 100 shares to remain delta neutral. Everyday Joes like you and me have to, but MM will only buy shares based on the delta value of the option and adjust as it ebbs and flows.

Final edit: read u/Unlucky-Prize comment below. It goes into further detail. 

Edit to add:

I'm hoping they add higher strikes for next week. If they do, this thing hits Andromeda.

What a fucking ride ✋💎✋🚀🚀🚀👨‍🚀🥜👩‍🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR. So, I’m here to help you degenerates. Broke off some BB gains to help this cause. GME boys seem to have things under control! Together we will rise! Robinhood is collecting a shit load of data off of us. Let’s make the daily movers list and add fuel to the 🔥🚀😂 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Still confused about what all this means. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Price and Number of shorted shares - correlation vs causation 🤓 ft. PLTR There is case made for prices not just reflecting simple buy and sell but also the amount of of available short shares to a greater extent. I'll take PLTR as an example, you look at PLTR when the price is low you can almost guarantee that the number of shares available are very little.

On **Jan 6th** the number of shares available for that day reached it's lowest and that's when the momentum swung back leading to the increasing trend seen below. On **December 15th** we also reach the lowest number of shares available and once again the momentum swings back.

Possibly because after reaching their lowest point you can't keep shorting so people start covering. Now this doesn't always happen but I can see a pattern that when there is a downturn and there are no available shares left, the direction of the trend reverses.

&#x200B;

[Points where shares available were lowest](https://preview.redd.it/f4wfn7lhkyc61.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7aa29b08a026a1f979046f7cfc8e7d64901781d)

[iburrowdesk shares availalbe for PLTR](https://preview.redd.it/7ngpi1y6nxc61.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff29e05ddbfe07cbfd30917b955ab1fcac21d8f1)

Just in **January 20th** PLTR shares available were around 200,000 and now it's at 1,000,000 and the price is starting to increase once more from the huge dip.

[Shares available were lowest before we see the huge rebound we saw today](https://preview.redd.it/0c395n68txc61.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa509c5a044839422db4fb41155868e120a3846b)

Now this doesn't always happen because on December 24th the price actually decreases to it's lowest. A possible explanation for the reversal is that a stock can't be shorted forever and when it reaches near it's maximum they start getting unwound. Also, it could just be a counfounding factor as short sellers know more about short interest than we do just like some shortseller said.

Now another reason that I can put some support to this theory is that in **October** when PLTR was trading at $9.00 the number of shares availalbe to be burrowed dropped from 6.7 million to 200k Probably even lower because you can't even see this on the graph.

&#x200B;

[When trading at $9 in october shares available dropped from 6.7 million to 200k](https://preview.redd.it/38zid15dsxc61.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c77f35343a1af3c2dce3c27b3f3caf4964157126)

Another ticker is SPWR the number of shares available to burrow was very low and the price has been increasing astronomically with the new government giving lots of support to green energy.

Going back to GME - this was when citron tweeted about the 5 reasons and the shares available plummeted. Now it's near 0.

PLTR volumes available to short now. Not that different from start of the squeeze.

I think that PLTR is a heavily shorted stock that has a possibility of a squeeze.

tl;dr I'm in PLTR for the long term despite being a 'casino'. This is just an interesting observation just for entertainment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why GME’s closing today is a sign that it will spike even more next week Listen up retards. Emerging addict here. Let me tell you why I think today’s closing price is a sign that GME is yet to rocket!

Why do you think the spike dropped to $60 and stayed there the rest of the day? Because the fuckton of $60 option calls that just expired. /u/PlayFree_Bird explained it well [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/). Today wasn’t a margin call, it was a gamma squeeze. The four-hour war at $60 is huge evidence of this. Basically, as the stock price increased, call writers realized they might have to provide stocks for the $60c option owners. Greedy bastards didn’t want to payout. What do they likely do instead? Fucking borrow more GME and short-sell the shit out of it to drop it below $60 and keep it there the rest of the day. If they succeed, they don’t have to provide shit on the butt-ton of 1/22 $60c options. If it closes above $60, they get fucked. For four hours today, every time the stock jumped above $60, call writers bought MORE SHORTS to drop the price back under $60.

Again, today wasn’t MM dumping shorts, it was options contracts buying MORE shorts attempting to save their ass (at least that's what my dumb ass thinks). But guess what? The stock closed at $64.75! Fuck! They lost!

So **why does this mean GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 in the future**?

1) This wasn’t the short squeeze, old shorts are likely still there bleeding fuck and filling the rocket with fuel.

2) Short holdings probably INCREASED today because the gamma squeeze above. More rocket fuel.

3) They lost the fucking bet on number 2, and have to fulfill the calls that expired today. More rocket pressure.

Notice: Aftermarket is up to $68. No more panic-pressure to keep it down.

It seems to me that GME is actually in a better position to rocket AFTER today, not worse. To the moon you retards! 🚀🌚

Pathetic Position: 23 sharse GME_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After a crazy GME increase my fianceé is convinced WSB is the way. So I bought $1k in GME shares at $39 and it has been an amazing ride so far. My fianceé started mad, then annoyed, dumb founded, and now hilariously impressed. Lmao her last text to me on the subject:

Post your experiences! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How WSB might get targeted soon(🚀🚫) Good idea to read if like me you came for easy 🚀STONKS, but your financial knowledge stops at “shiny rock can get me many normal rocks”

Probably next week the big squeeze will happen and we will crush a big handful of crooks, robbing the 0.1% of a few billion dollars. What next?

Do you think they are simply gonna roll over and let us enjoy or gains? 

What I think they will instead do is: 

1) hire people to look through the subreddit and find posts hyping certain stocks, and then as we start buying they would short them. We saw similar tactics being used on GME and the reason we broke through is sheer autistic🚀 numbers and a solid strategy, this won’t work on individual calls.

2) create false hype around sinking stocks, maybe even a few heavily doctored DD, this will definetly trick newbies like me and only TA esperts might be able to call Bs on it, but they might be downvoted by Bot armies and disappear in an ocean of comments.

3) scare their other billionaires friends that the peasants are coming for their tendies and to steal their influence, rich people clubs are exclusive for a reason they don’t want us there. I’m not sure what they could do, but rich people weild way more influence that a sub reddit, SEC calls are just one of many ways they could trip us. There might be even be new regulations on trading, this would hurt them too, but as long as we stay out of reach it would be be a good trade off.

4) various: call bs on perfectly good DD, spamming restricted content to have the subreddit quarantined etc.

5) (edited) might use our newfound influence to cause bump and dumps.

Possible solutions:

Well, fuck me if i know, I thought of making the subreddit private, but with 2 million users we would sooner earn a million working on a min wage that find all leaks and infiltrators. Same problem would apply with moving to another subreddit or even an external website.

I think all we can realistically do to resist the storm is: 

remain low-profile outside the platform, if we remain quiet it will be harder to call a crusade on our asses.

avoid giant rally posts that make our already lacking IQ go further down until 🚀 is the only thing we understand.

Actually confirm the DD is legit by doing your own research.

And most importantly, don’t fucking throw all the money you got back in the market, enjoy it a little, we don’t want these old mummies to get it all back at the same time, right?

I've been wanting to get in on this company for a while now so I looked a bit more into it and found this [source](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/2/163979/Tencent-mulls-'club-loan'-for-acquisition,-report-says) mentioning that it could likely be a Korean or US company. Since the posting of the rumors, Tencent has already acquired the Canadian [Klei entertainment](https://www.gematsu.com/2021/01/tencent-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-klei-entertainment), but keep in mind that they buy smaller studios like this one [all the fucking time](https://www.thegamer.com/tencent-secured-more-games-ma-deals-in-2020-than-any-other-studio/), and the reports about raising several billion are very recent so definitely nothing to do with that.

For those of you lost souls who don't know about Tencent, they are a Chinese behemoth with a $862 billion market cap who own, among others, big portions of Epic games (Fortnite, Unreal Engine, etc), Riot Games (League of Legends), Supercell (all the big grossing mobile games like Clash Royale), minor stakes in studios like Activision and Ubisoft, and a [bunch of other shit](https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/). They also own WeChat and a growing music business ($TME) and possibly your mom and your firstborn kid, I don't even know.

I don't think they are trading at high multiples at the moment, and they seem to have decent debt ratios and a crazy growth, so the acquisition of a major studio could potentially bring them even more to mainstream attention. They're already up around 24% this year. With a revenue of $60B it would have to be something huge to really have any serious impact on their balance sheet, but even something smaller could be interesting.

Looking to open up a discussion thread about today's GME Short Data. I'm attaching an image from ORTEX after today's beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We're only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago\*\*, you would know that I kept on hammering the term 'zero point' over and over. It just means it's the starting point (whether it's your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you've held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, **especially** after today's close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched \~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from ***\~13 years ago*** (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), *and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @* $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It's some fucking tendie-town shit.

All the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS' advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they're getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew "Left for Dead" Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain't that the truth.

I don't claim to be an expert on GME short metrics & data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I'm attaching here, hence a discussion thread. *AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?*

However: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit ***only slightly***, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let's discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC >100%, at 102.29%. *Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.* Can't complain though lmao. *Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!*

Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) '*fixed'* massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/*might not* sell, *all while* the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn *Atlantic Ocean* with no boats nor ships in sight. It's like *Titanic*, but they're Jack, and you're *the sexy-ass rich bitch* named Rose. Only one survives. *(Spoiler alert: It ain't Jack.)*

All said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (*we're talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)* e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be *THE* trade of your lifetime.

[CRAYONS TO TENDIE-TOWN, BITCH. \/ You like that, daddy? The image attached is in FULL 4K RESOLUTION. It's some RICH-PEOPLE SHIT. Makes me dripping wet asf looking at those crayons and those numbers 😩💦😩😩🐳🐳🍆🍆🍆😩😩💦💦💦 it probably means were about to git fookin rich as fook, can finally afford tendies 3x a day 24\/7 GODDAMN DADDY FUCKK](https://preview.redd.it/xquiruns9yc61.jpg?width=7659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d6d13ea9895a57c80ced0e43c6ebd00b702834c)

>Lastly, a special shoutout to our brother and OG GME GANG **Rod Alzmann** ( u/Uberkikz11 on reddit, and [Rod Alzmann](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann) on Twitter. Rod is--among many titles--the Prime Author of the GME DD website, accessible to anyone curious about GME-GameStop Valuation Targets : [$GME DD](https://www.gmedd.com/) ) He was live on BENZINGA this morning, giving a NON-RETARDED & INTELLIGENT REPRESENTATION of GME LONGS and Retail Investors alike ([$GME With Rod Alzmann & CJ Trades | ZingerNation Power Hour - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzTU87MJMM), starts at around 18:39); and I watched as the MARKET FUCKING RIPPED THE SHORTS TO SHREDS (EVEN INFLICTING MULTIPLE TRADING HALTS) WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED LMAO. Even the Benzinga hosts couldn't fucking believe it themselves. Appreciate the good work, brother. Fucking cheers!! Maybe Ryan Cohen next? 😎

**GME = WHALE-MAKER** 🐳 🐳🐳🐳

**Long live WSB, and Long live GME. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**Positions**: 100% GME. Diversified at 2/3 in Shares, 1/3 in April calls, and I rode these fuckers to war even during and after the **Q3ER** share price crash, due to paper hands and heavy short-seller action. **#WeRemember** and **#WeWillNeverForget.** **NOW, it's time for the Shorts to pay lmao.** (Current Value in $ : *more than tree fiddy,* and *more than enough* *to finance* Andrew "Left for dead" Citron's onlyfans as a tax-deductible charity expense.)

edit 4: added an important comment, thanks to u/otto989.

>u/otto989: *Hold up it says Thursday, Jan 21 at the bottom right of the chart. I'm as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.*  
>  
>u/fieryskyes: *Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today's close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the "%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN" data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself."*

Yea, the "%Free float on loan" actually increased by \~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It *could* mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it's all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.

Don't worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. *Shorts will not get out alive.* Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way. Just consider it if you want the raw data for yourself.

You have made the world a better place to live...ha ha ha._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I guess as long as you stay in the game you can make it back. Been very lucky lately _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I am about to get tendied 😭😭😭 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bionano isn't done mooning ($BNGO)🚀 It is up several x's but that doesn't mean it can't go up more. Like Peter Lynch said, a stock can go from $100 to $0, but can also go from $1 to $100. BNGO has just gotten started mooning. Bionano has alot more potential. It has gotten some media attention, but not real mainstream media attention, which it is starting to get. Pacbio went from $3 to $40 in just over a half a year and i think bionano will moon faster to $30 then pacbio.

Catalysts:

* Genomics convention next week (26 jan is the day which bionano will speak)
* Earnings march
* fda approval, isn't needed to moon but if they get it, it will boost the stock. Pacbio doesn't have FDA approval but still has ARKG invested in them)
* ARKG invest may happen

Positive things about Bionano:

* Their product (saphyr). Uses OM (Optical mapping) Which is patented, Pacbio uses Sequencing. Sequencing can look at each individual tree and OM can see the whole forest. Can detect different kind of symtoms (structural variants) like autism, tumors, diabetes, plants and many more.
* Data collection
* Software
* CFO has worked at tesla🚀
* Maxim Group raises BNGO price target from $2 to $14 (2021-22-01)([Link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/01/19271569/hearing-maxim-raises-price-target-on-bionano-genomics-from-2-to-14-bionano-shares-are-up-6-in-premar))
* There is no direct competitor (Maybe nabsys in 5-10 years)
* Their product saphyr can see genetic drivers of severe covid-19 Susceptibility.
* They have hired Alka Chaubey as Chief Medical Officer. She has helped companys before with FDA.

Tom nash has made some good DD on youtube (Youtubelink3 is the most relevant)([YoutubeLink1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgu62fIZWw))([YoutubeLink2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mphuyNvbP4U))([YoutubeLink3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAf9XvT9v5c))

Second offering is now done which means it will moon next week for sure.

TLDR; BNGO $20-30 March. Buy next week or regret it 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Market Cap of GME at 20 was 1.385B, or our position was about 110M.  Now that position is worth around 360M or gain of 250MMM for this sub.  I propose we declare Jan 22 GME day at WSB or something....Before we can move sub 2B stocks....now we can go for 10B plus companies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did WSB inversers get a Margin Call today? Almost every WSB meme stock is up today - GME, BB, PLTR, CRSR, FUBO etc. The spike in BB directly correlates to one of the halts that occurred in GME, and I don’t think it is coincidence. 

What I think happened - due to a small gamma squeeze that happened in GME today, this forced the shorts to cover by closing other short positions. (shorts in PLTR, FUBO... you get the picture.) 

What does this mean for us autists?

The shorts of GME have TRIPLED down!! They foolishly believe that the short interest in GME will not result in the largest short squeeze in human history - and they are WRONG. 

TLDR: Mad money to be made in any WSB meme stock in the coming days if GME continues to rise and the shorts have to continue to cover!

# obligatory rockets:  🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀

# What is Corsair?

*“CORSAIR offers a complete range of products to equip gamers, enthusiasts, and esports athletes, including mechanical keyboards, precision gaming mice, wireless headsets, premium PC components, and the CORSAIR ONE fully-integrated gaming PC.”* **Basically, they sell high-quality items to gamers.**

&#x200B;

## Gaming Peripheral Industry as a Whole

The global gaming peripheral market size was valued at USD **3.88 billion in 2019** and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **10.4% from 2020 to 2025.**

And who tf sells gaming peripherals? CRSR and its main competitor Logitech (LOGI)...

**Now let's step into the ring with LOGI and CRSR**

($LOGI)

Net Revenue: +73%

Gross Profit: +108%

Operating Income: +18%

Net Income: +276%

($CRSR)

Corsair Net Revenue: +60.7%

Gross Profit: +112.4%

Operating Income: +353.6%

Net Income: +2293.5%

&#x200B;

Obviously, Corsair is expanding like a fucking madman and will continue to do so this year. They are stacking up very well against LOGI numbers-wise.

The fun doesn't stop there... "\[Corsair\] commands over 18 percent of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42 percent of gaming PC components."

Logitech has a current price of $104 and a market cap of $17.2B Corsair has a current price of $38 and a market cap of $5.35B

**CORSAIR IS LIKE 2/5 THE PRICE OF LOGI BUT IS EXPANDING QUICKER, ACQUIRING MORE COMPANIES, AND HAS AWAY MORE LOYAL FOLLOWING**

## What differentiates them from the competition?

1. **Quality:** Anyone who buys a corsair product will instantly realize the superior build quality and feel. Somewhat like Apple products, Corsair products are ascetically pleasing, last for ages, and offer many creature comforts.
2. **Name Brand:** If you look at any PC forum that recommends what parts to buy Corsairs’ name will always be popping up. Experienced gamers know what Corsair offers and superior build quality. Most of the time one-off Chinese brands that also sell PC peripherals are not named; People recommend Corsair instead. Almost all of the commentators on this Reddit post swear by Corsair's product line. This is not just a one-time occurrence, it can be seen regularly; Enthusiasts recommending Corsair due to their amazing products.
3. **United Product Front:** Unlike a lot of their competitors, like Logitech or Razer, Corsair has a diverse product lineup for inside and outside of gamers’ PCs. Almost all of these product lighting can be controlled by Corsair's proprietary lighting software. Lighting sounds very stupid, I know, but gamers love it as it makes their PC look cool. With iCue all of the owner’s Corsair products can be controlled from a single interface. This encourages people to stay in the Corsair ecosystem once they purchase their first Corsair product. Everything just works together perfectly.

To sum up, they shit on their competitors for their better execution.

**Their products:**

Computer RAM (light up)

CPU air and water coolers (light up) Keyboards (light up)

Mice (light up)

Headsets (light up)

Mouse Pads (light up)

Computer power supplies (light up)

Headset stands (light up) RGB strips (light up)

PC Cases (light up)

PC Case fans (you guessed it, light up)

**If a consumer can buy all of their peripherals from one company and have them work harmonically together, why not?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

## But consoles are becoming more and more popular…right?

Yes - and Corsair is covered. They own “Scuff Gaming” which is “a global innovator and creator of high-performance gaming controllers, providing superior accessories and customized gaming controllers for console and PC that are used by top professional gamers as well as casual gamers”

Scuff has cornered the 3rd party controller market. When someone has a non Xbox or PS4 brand controller they ask, “Is that a scuff?” Scuff is the only real name brand company that makes comfortable and quality 3rd party controllers. Unlike Corsair there is much less high level competition in this space. Also almost all competitive console players use a scuff controller due to the superior button layout and customizability.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91fonxmq7yc61.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef39e5a08918c9c38ebf3048241f4fdbd8a61c7

## I see a lot more people streaming on youtube and twitch now…Is there money to be made?

Yes! Corsair also owns Elgato which creates necessities for streamers. Elgato does not only offer necessities for steamers but also for YouTubers, filmmakers, and hobbyists. They offer a wide variety of products to produce high-quality videos. Again like Corsair, Elgato is one of the best, if not the best, at what it does in its industry.

## But who wants to build their own PC when I can just build a prebuilt?

I think you know what I am going to say. Corsair offers this through their subsidiary Origin PCs. Origin offers some great value for money prebuilt PCs because they can secure exclusive deals with Corsair as it is its parent company. I am not going to sugarcoat this, but Origin does have ALOT of competition in this space but I think it is good that Corsair has exposure. I know multiple people who really like their Origin PCs but I know just as many who own other prebuilt that get the job done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Your whole setup could be Corsair…**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/js7wto5s7yc61.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be497c21bdef1b9292840378107f03aff9dd73b

&#x200B;

**TLDR: CRSR** 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀

They shit on their competition, that plain and simple

&#x200B;

**So how am I playing all of this?**

**SHARES SHARES SHARES (for their next ER which is expected around Febuary 10th but has not been confirmed yet).**

There will probably be a runup if the hype is there so calls could be good to capture that IV runup but I am sticking to shares so I have less risk holding through ER.

See you there!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Big boys shorting all our plays? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "the short trades will be killed off with no chance to respawn." - S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Summary from Barrons.com:

"...GameStop stock rocketed above its 2007 peak Friday in a move that one short selling expert thinks could possibly kill investor interest in shorting the videogame retailer. Surging volatility also led to brief halts in trading.

Pointing to an earlier squeeze where a moderate amount of older short sellers covered their positions as the stock surged in recent weeks, S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky told Barron's he thinks today's action has piled up mark-to-market losses for even newer short sellers betting on a price decline.

He thinks that will, "force both older and newer shorts to reconsider their conviction in this trade -- more than likely, the short trades will be killed off with no chance to respawn."

"Brokers have been searching for stock to meet the existing short demand but are coming up empty as virtually all the lendable shares have already been taken down on the street," Dusaniwsky told Barron's...."

S3 Partners is one of the most important allies we can have, if anyone understands the potential here it's them.

Edit: Missed one letter_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Record Options and White Knuckles for Shorts Fuel GameStop Mania _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Frigging 🥜 compared to what we'll be at in a few weeks. I'M NOT SELL 🚀🚀🚀🚀 LFG _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are Surges In GME, PLTR Related? Total speculation on my part here, and perhaps the professionals who frequent here can help us out on figuring out if the lemon has been squeezed.  A preface, as many posts today have said, QUIT MAKING THIS SHIT PERSONAL, DOXXING IS NEVER COOL.  This is about making tendies.

Citron has been most public about shorting GME, and y'all have well documented this week's PR cluster surrounding that, culminating in the announcement that they'll no longer talk about it.  

We also have quite a few posts that the bump today was someone's margin call.

More quietly, PLTR has been steadily climbing today, and is knocking on the door of all time highs.  A reminder that [Citron called PLTR a "full casino" way back in...November.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-target-short-selling-position-citron-research-pltr-2020-11-1029845368)

Presuming they've still got their position in PLTR too, and PLTR gaining 25% today, we know they're hurting.

Both GME and PLTR are "hard to borrow" stocks, with GME's available shares to short well documented daily here as well.  Anyone have a read on how many PLTR shares are out there, and whether we've got a squeeze going on now there?  And, just possibly, if a certain firm is going dark today not because of Doxxing, but because every time the phone rings, margin is calling? 

Whether it is Citron or not, it seems that today was a great day to be long meme stonks, and a horrible, horrible day to be a short seller.

Also, Rocket Rocket Rocket....  **🚀🚀🚀🚀** **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Positions:  400 shares PLTR, 150 late to the party shares of GME.

But Steel Dynamics (STLD) is a profitable steel manufacturer in the US that is reporti g their earnings on Monday, Jan 25th after hours.

I think this would be a good play and wanted to share. They typically beat earnings, and their Q4 earnings have historically led to a week or two of +10% gains following earnings from the end of January to mind-February.

Positive forces: Price of iron is down, expected production demand to increase in post covid environment, cheap cost of money will lead to increased infrastructure / capital improvements.

Potential alpha: STLD is rumored to be the supplier of steel for the TSLA Cybertruck. STLD is building a massive plant in Texas near the new Tesla Cybertruck factory. This hasn't been confirmed. 

Cons: It's steel. Steel is boring and typically take a long time to respond to market forces.

With that in mind, STLD recently upped their earnings guidance for Monday's release, and the stock is trading down vs 52wk highs. I would expect an earnings surprise and increased guidance for the rest of 2021 for a post covid schedule. This may not seem flashy, but when SNE had a similar surprise and guidance lift, their stock rose ~30%.

Love to see you there!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Next Great Renewable Energy Companies  

[https://imgur.com/gallery/v6C2BmV](https://imgur.com/gallery/v6C2BmV)

**TLDR: American Superconductor $30 C 7/16** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Previously I wrote about Enphase Energy 1 year ago and people doubted the investment opportunity

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct16c1/whos\_with\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct16c1/whos_with_me/)

And rightfully so as I did not understand YOLOing in Options. Now I'm leveraged to the moon with contracts! (funny what a year can bring)

Back then, Enphase energy was trading at $32 and many people naysayers flooded my inbox. People looked at the P/E ratio and I had responses saying that it wouldn't hold. Well, look at where we are now; ENPH became an industry leader in microinverters for solar panel systems and is now trading at a 566% gain from when I posted that. Though I believe that there is still a long runway for ENPH and I do still have a position within it, I do believe that there is a potentially better investment moving forward.

As we all know, the Biden administration will push and promote renewables and renewable infrastructure within the next 4 years.

" He will launch **a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future**. " - according to his website

Though most of the market is now aware of solar companies and wind energy companies, there is a huge gap in focus of infrastructure.

The next 4 years we will see a huge push and incentives for companies taking out age old infrastructure and replacing them with modern, ecofriendly, and more efficient systems to meet the rising demands of power.

That's where American Superconductor comes in.

This company specializes in MEGA-Watt scale power solutions that improve the performance of power grids., and electric utilities.

As we know, there is increasing demand for Electric vehicles thanks to companies like Tesla as well as ramping up production of EVs from other car manufacturers. There will also be new wind as well as solar farms propping up in the very near future to meet the goals of switching to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels. In the near future, we're going to see a lot more charging stations, as well as more demand in infrastructure to deliver renewables energy into cities. **How do you get large renewable energy wind/solar, which is concentrated in the suburbs and farmlands of America, into the cities?** You do it with new power lines, and ideally more efficient ones.

Their main product, a high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire that will take up less space and transmit up to **10 times more power**, **allowing bulk transfer of transmission-level power at distribution voltages.**

We're going to need new infrastructure to scale up the demand for renewable energy. American Superconductor will be one of those companies that will rise in the coming months and years.

Currently, it's trading at $28 and is set to have earnings reports after hours on 2/3/21.

Looking at their EPS reports, the company has increased revenue over every single quarter over the past year. (Similar to ENPH a year ago.) ***And is still unknown to the masses.***

Q1 2020 -0.24

Q2 2020 -0.15

Q3 2020 -.13

Q4 - 2/3/21

Looking at their past earnings, it's clear that this company is on track to have positive revenue within this year.

In the post I mention that with a new president, the US will most likely adopt a foreign policy similar to 2009-2017. In light of the new administration, I would like clarify and address some issues that have come up since my first post.

"Over the last month, Citi and Credit Suisse both **downgraded** the shares to a sell rating or the equivalent." **(and people think we're dumb lol)**

Reasons include:

1. "On Jan. 13, Citi analyst Tyler Radke cut PLTR stock to 'sell' from 'neutral.' In addition to valuation, Radke cited [“the lapping of Covid-19 related contracts”](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-had-a-huge-run-up-in-2020-citi-says-its-time-to-sell-51610556595) this year and in 2022 as a reason for his downgrade."
2. "On Dec. 18, Credit Suisse’s Brad Zelnick [lowered his rating](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-palantir-stock-credit-suisse-says-questioning-valuation-51608315660) on the stock to “underperform” as well. Zelnick noted that the company’s “valuation \[is\] disconnected from fundamentals” and the stock is well ahead of itself. Additionally, the analyst warned that Palantir could be hurt by customer companies being reluctant to spend a great deal of money on contracts going forward."

Well, I'm hear to say **fuck the nerds at Citi and Credit Suisse**. To address the first point, **PLTR didn't start as a COVID tracking company**, they started as a fucking **"track and kill terrorist"** company. COVID contracts are just icing on the **PLTR freedom dispersing cake**.

The valuation is disconnected from the fundamentals???? What. Just because these analysts **don't understand** the company, does not mean they need to **make some shit up**.

**(Most IMPORTANT)** Lets think about what PLTR does: big data. **Their data isn't your covid sick grandma**, it's **secret government documents**. Even if a worthy/better/less expensive competitor presents themselves, **which military or government official will take the risk of transferring large quantities of classified data**? NO ONE. The threat of spillage or losing secrets is a bigger deterrent than saving a couple million dollars. PLTR may get other competitors in their space, but **no intelligent person would take the risk of transferring TOP SECRET/CLASSIFIED data to a new platform**. It's not going to happen.

The idea that PLTR is not a solid company blows my fucking mind. This shit hasn't even started to fly.

TLDR: PLTR is extremely misunderstood. Just because Citi and Credit Suisse can't read numbers, does not make them right.

Unrelated, but you have have a DD without fucking charts or graphs. There are intangibles when it comes to a companies value. I can stare at a fucking cool graph, contract list, or an article about them "potentially" losing a COVID contract all day. It's not news until it happens. Grab your balls and hold strong.

I'm suspected that the runs from a couple of days and today Gamma Squeeze on GME probably forced some Shorters to cover their short position on GME by unloading their other heavily short position on wsb meme stock such as PLTR and other stocks to cover their ass.

Now PLTR is in the stratosphere without someone pulling them down even the hit pieces and also BB got another run from nowhere today even there is news of insider unloading their shares.

I expect to see more run on the stock market next week if this is true. Short are burning hard, and a lot of money is changing hands.

TLDR ; SOMEONE HEAVILY SHORT WSB MEME STOCK AND NOW HAVE TO COVER THEIR ASS BECAUSE OF GME

As promised boys here is the update from the stratosphere. We are now in the endgame(stop)

The rocket is fueled up and lift off is a go. The final nail in the coffin was Citron dropping his pants and presenting his rear with that embarrassing live-stream. The market sensed weakness and pounced.

Over the weekend the hedge funds will have many desperate meetings but will ultimately realize there is no way out. Come Monday more of them will undoubtedly crack and begin to cover. The first rats to jump ship will be wounded but will survive

When the price breaks 100, it will plateau as the remaining boomers and paperhands disembark the rocketship,

After the shorts realize no one else is selling, they will resume covering and the price will continue upward

If you are bullish on this stock (you should be) the fair value for this stock is now 169, not even accounting for the squeeze pressure . Check the excellent model put together by the folks over at [gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com/) who have done some amazing work

The next exit point is 300.

Cohen's previous company, Chewy trades at around 330 and the pet food market is a fraction of what video industry is worth. Long term, this stock will break 500 a slice no problem.

The danger here is not missing the peak (as it takes days for hedges to unwind huge positions) but selling too early, and you won't even be able to afford your initial stake after the squeeze has squozen

&#x200B;

As we approach 500+ we enter the land of diamond hands. Only the slow moving institutions and the true autistic diamond dick gods among us will make it this far.

It’s just absurd how much they are trying to appease the short firms by scaring paper hands into selling because they fear GME has already peaked. I mean for gods sake they said shorts started to cover the minute Ryan Cohen was added to the board. The stock went up a dollar on the day that was announced and short interest fucking increased over the following week.

What do I do next?  I immediately buy more contracts and lose 700.00 because I got scared.

What do I do next? Put 4000.00 back into BB contracts.  Sold at a loss of 800.00 on that.

I have a foolproof 100x stock that’s about to pop in February. Aurora Cannabis has been tanking all through 2020 but some Democrat wins have awakened the beast. The stock has tripled since November and with their earnings coming out in mid February, they will report their first positive EBITDA. Bulletpoints below will 100% prove that this stock is gonna rocket way passed the moon.

•	Obviously with the Democrats controlling the house and senate we are more likely to get friendly marijuana legislation. In fact, a bill was passed in the house in December that decriminalizes Marijuana throughout the US meaning that Banks can now accept money made through marijuana sales. With mama Kamala breaking the tie in the senate, it’s a slam dunk for some favorable points with young people. Guaranteed to be top of their agenda. Expect announcements in the next month and a bump in stock when all the idiot brokers hear the news for the first time. 
•	As mentioned above Aurora Cannabis has been tanking through 2020. In September they added a new CEO, Miguel Martin. In their last earnings call Martin casually claimed that the company would be EBITDA positive by Q2 2021, which is this February. Several articles followed the call brushing off the statement has him being cocky, but they didn’t look at the facts. 
•	Aurora Cannabis has spent 2020 shutting down operations, laying off staff, buying less inventory and paying down debt. The CEO is setting them up to be purchased! He previously owned a company that was purchased by Aurora Cannabis and was then put in charge as the CEO. He knows how to put a company in the best possible sales position. When the analysts see positive earnings on a pot stock they are going to rush in and the stock will fly.

Lemme $TELL you your next multi bagger Tellurian ($TELL) is a liquified natural gas startup. Been around since 2011. Time, the industry, and Covid have not been kind to them, but they managed to survive. Pre covid levels this was $7 a share. They're now $3.00 a share with the wind behind their backs.  


&#x200B;

[Look at that VOLUME!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/yw4ebyqzqxc61.png?width=2251&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d6cdb3e47d6e7210cfac06454a103e2e945b889)

Now with soaring LNG prices in europe and asia, LNG facility (Driftwood) construction slated for summer, and with same founder behind Cheniere ($LNG) -  $TELL is poised to explode as soon as Deal is announced. 

TLDR: If you got a $1000 to blow heres some easy 100%ers or greater.

Long Value: shares 

Patience: 7/21 4.5c @ 1.00

Positions:

5000 shares $TELL @ 1.66

100 2/19 2.5C @ .15

100 1/2022 15c @ .35

As an analog, check out $LNG circa 2011. They shot up 1300% over the year after their announcement of their SAP (sale and purchase agreement) with GAIL (india's natural gas company).  


![img](r8s4jylkkxc61 "$LNG rise from a low to a high circa 2011 - 2013(they currently are trading around 65 a share)
")

Okay, you ask yourself, why not just buy a competitor, or hell $LNG to take advantage of these prices?  


Well, the growth potential. Duh.  And also long term value.

**Keys:**

**Source of gas** 

Tellurian is unique in that it will source its facilities with its own natural gas from Haynesville production. Haynesville also has ALOT of gas. This eliminates dealing with the volatility of purchasing it on an exchange like Henry Hub. This source brings the cost of gas to $2.00 MMbtu + $.75 debt service + $.75 transportation = $3.50 MMbtu

**Price and Buyers**

Then you consider okay, but how much can they sell their LNG for, and to who?

Europe and Asia. 

Clean enrgy policies, environmental image, and Russian seediness, middle east hesitancies all point to the US to help supply the hungry appetite for reliable energy.

### Jumia Technologies  ([JMIA](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/jmia)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=JMIA) advanced after Citron Research recently tweeted that the e-commerce platform's stock was on its way to $100 per share and called it the "largest opportunity in e-commerce." The firm had accused Jumia Technologies of fraud last year.

First they say Jumia is a fraud? and now it is the largest e-commerce opportunity? How can anybody belive what they are saying it is obvious that they try to manipulate the market, first this desperate try on GME, and now they try to push Jumia.... 

Why is there no investigation from SEC? Why people listen to them? On all news shows they get quoted?

https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/lit/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Haven't heard this take on GME before Most of this article is fluff garbage but check out that one paragraph near bottom:

>But there's another level of danger to the gamma squeezes. This involves  the relentless, high-volume buying in low-priced far out-of-the-money  call options to drive a stock price higher by forcing the market maker  to purchase the stock as protection against their selling the calls,  assuming they can't find another party to take the risk. For market  makers unable to pass the risk, they could soon find themselves out of  business. We could also see market makers begin to abandon stocks.

Literal opposite of what's happening, from my understanding.  Highest priced call I can even see on RH is $60.

# AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GM & $F are jokes. Ford and General Motors are jokes. People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀. you can't make a car company into a high tech car company, you can't make a high tech company into a car company. they have to be one company, not a partnership.

I’ve been watching each closely for about a month now, and it makes sense that many would be skeptical at first about NOK’s fair price evaluations by most.

When it comes to their overall size in comparison to the two aforementioned giants, it can be easy to write off NOK as an impossible player within the market. However, what many fail to realize or just simply neglect, is the fact that NOK not only has done much more to flesh out 5G as a consumer-ready item, but they haven’t faced any of the same obstacles as their competitors; this is evident through ERIC (their most viable competitor IMO) massively cutting their profit forecasts due to the intense competition over 5G. Back in 2018 when Trump blocked the AVGO.O buyout of QCOM.O, it shot 5G heroin into the veins NOK and ERIC execs, who saw it as an even greater opportunity to enter the market. Since then, the race, especially headed by Huawei due to the initial amount of 5G towers invested in, has taken a turn from being about which phones will have better performance from 5G, and onto greater innovations in order to take full advantage of 5G capabilities. This brings us to today.

NOK announced a partnership with the Saudi Arabian telecommunications and internet services company Mobily in a press release on March 4, 2020. This allowed NOK to test and further develop the outer limits and commercial strengths of 5G, which eventually led to two days ago, Jan 20.

NOK and Mobily successfully piloted the first ever 4/5G Fixed Wireless Access network slicing. If you’re not a fucking nerd, you probably have no clue what that means at all. I’ll do my best to spell it out. Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) allows for companies (such as VZ and T) to provide high speed broadband to places where putting a fiber cable would be pointless. This would greatly increase the BPI of these companies, so they’ll be looking to make possible contracts with NOK in order to flesh out this tech. Furthermore, FWA greatly increases the viability of other companies to incorporate 5G tech into their products using NOK’s comm chips. 

NOK’s recent innovations should make it an obv. undervalued share at its current price. For the past 5 years NOK has been somewhat stagnant. However, the magnitude of this achievement cannot be understated, and the fact that the stock price saw such a small per-cent increase is a testament to the fact that an uninformed public won’t pick up on such a thing immediately. However, NOK’s earnings are expected to be given on Feb 4 this year. That’s less than two weeks. I highly believe that one of two things are possible; either NOK hasn’t had the time to broker deals with the larger telecoms companies and earnings will be low (keep in mind earnings will be from the entirety of their last fiscal quarter, so investors will be watching their most recent growth), or NOK will have brokered deals by the earnings report date (which I find more likely), and would reflect so within their earnings report.

Lot I couldn’t get to in order to keep from writing a full novel (such as why phone manufacturers were reluctant to implement 5G, and why they would be much less reluctant now), so I’ll link some shit you can read on your own.

Read this and dont panic sell:

https://www.warriortrading.com/circuit-breaker-halts/

Circuit Breaker Halt: Volatility Pause Code: LUDP
A halt on a Volatility Pause is one of the most common types of circuit breaker halts in the market.  If a stock moves up or down too quickly within a 5min period it can cause an automatic circuit breaker halt that will pause trading for 5min.

This helps smooth volatility in the market and prevent flash crashes.  It forces traders to take a 5min time out, research the stock, news, etc.  Often times if a stock is spiking up and is halted, it will reopen higher._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I am 100% new to this but you retards got me pumped.

Its a struggle to find good undervalued ideas in this market, but here's one I like

**OSTK**: [Overstock.com](https://overstock.com/) is an e-commerce company. Current 2020 revenues is 2.5bn (67% up yoy over 2019) and the company trades at under $3bn market cap

* **Cheap vs. e-comm competitors**: Wayfair($W) trades at 2.4x EV/Sales, Etsy ($ETSY) trades at 19x EV/sales, Real ($REAL) trades at 5x EV/sales -> $OSTK trades at 1.1x EV/sales.
* **Industry tail-winds**: I'm sure everyone's seen those graphs of how e-commerce penetration is gone up from 17% to 30% last year. The sector is going through massive disruptions, and $OSTK is capturing it
* **Management turn-around**: In Sep 2019, Overstock replaced its eccentric owner Patrick Bryne (who has no involvement now), and replaced him with Jonathan Johnson who has focused on execution and helped turn it around into a profitable e-comm biz, growing revenues 50% yoy. (Shades of $GME, $BB)
* **Q4 earnings outperformance:** Street estimates Q4 revenue of $650mm, which is down 12% qoq which makes no sense. Every year, Q4 revenues have been higher than Q3 (holiday shopping, black friday etc) and this year should be no different. The amount of online shopping this year was enormous compared to years past due to pandemic, so no reason why we should not set a quarterly record.
* **Disruptive startup** **portfolio**: see comments
* **Technical set-up:** I'm no technical wizard, but check out some of the popular accounts on Twitter on $OSTK. Its breaking out of a wedge and is about to moon. In my opinion, if it breaks 75, we will see 100-120 soon.
* **Short interest:** 18%
* **Strong cash position:** They have >$500mm in cash, and the stock has not recovered since their secondary offering (down 50% from ATH)

**$OSTK Positions:** Long 900 stock, Long 9 Mar calls at 75, Long 6 June calls at 75 🚀

[DD for idiots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I’d like to start off by saying, this is not about $GME.

It’s about $PLTR. 🚀

I’m going to state my opinion on GME first however so I can get the criticism out of the way. I made my profits, got in at about $37, and I honestly doubted myself if it’d go up. I believed in you guys, and believed in u/DeepFuckingValue more than anything. I admit; I cashed out today at $71 per share. I made some good returns and whether or not it continues to rise is beyond me, I hope it does but I also hope that all the people who get in today don’t become bag holders. It’s really stressful, especially not knowing where the peak is gonna be. However, this is where I draw everyone’s attention to the best play yet to be made.

Today in PLTR’s unpredictable (yet predictable if you check my linked posts) journey we saw a good 15% run, and is still continuing to do so. Reason being that there’s a major demo-day happening for $PLTR on Tuesday. Followed by earning reports shortly after. This means everyone’s wanting to buy in now before the weekend and not having to get in last minute on Monday the day before. This small gain is only a fraction of what $PLTR is capable of doing, I recommend reading [this deep dive for retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you’re clueless on why Palantir is a good buy. 

Here’s why I’m making a part two:

WSB is unstoppable, if you’re still a doubter. That’s probably because you’re a paper handed fuck who checks RH every hour of the day and wets themselves when they see -5%. If you want to play a little more passive for guaranteed free money, PLTR is the move. Upon this demo-day and earnings report I’m expecting nothing but good news, which leads us to lockup. 

Lockup will be happening very soon as well, that’s when 80% of the current stock that’s unavailable to be trader because it’s held by insiders (employees and some investors) will able to be publicly trader. You may think that’s a bad thing, however it’s not. Yes, I do think lots of shares will be sold off. Although, this allows huge investment firms to be able to finally get their hands on some PLTR shares that they haven’t been able to receive since its DPO. If major investment firms start claiming those shares upon lockup, then this is the inevitable moon we’ve all been waiting for. But what if they don’t buy up these shares? That’s where we come in. You’ve done it with $GME, you had faith in DeepFuckingValue. Now, have faith in $PLTR and Shuffil. You can either buy some shares now, which may seem high but I promise it’s only a fraction because $PLTR is the best long-term hold currently in the entire market. That’s a bold claim, but we all know it’s true. Just look at its infantile competition $SNOW, which IPO’d at @$200+. Take those $GME tendies and set yourself up for the Tesla of data analysis, something all companies will need in order to succeed in the future. 

TL;DR: Buy PLTR with $GME tendies. PLTR demo-day next week, followed by earning report shortly after.

🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VIDEO: Bill Ackman and JCPenney Parallels to GameStop You should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C2Z75X6_g4&feature=youtu.be) of Bill Ackman talking about why his investment in JCPenney failed if you want to learn something.  The similarities between this story and GameStop's current situation is pretty interesting I think.  And this is NOT me implying the same thing will happen or that the situations are identical; I just find the insight interesting.  

Both stories include an activist investor who grabs a few spots on the board of an older retailer with the goal of turning the company around.

Fuck the shorts. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 1 DAY RECOVERY _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME - I think this is a Gamma Squeeze where dealers COULD NOT hedge fast enough ***You guys did it. By concentrating enough WSB autism in one point in the form of $60 call options, you created a previously unproven distortion of the fabric of vol/price/time known as a Degenerity, where vol became price, green became red (for dealers) red became green (for option holders), bears like me get excited for bulls, and the market broke, spawning a wormhole to a new universe where GME is somehow above it's ATH, and spraying out a massive field distortion via degenerons, which are now being detected on CNBC.  It's like a black hole, but with options. I look forward to those with PhDs in physics and finance expanding upon this theory. Expect additional unforseen repercussions such as*** r/investing ***advocating a 10% allocation to "YOLO" in their now 4 fund portfolio (domestic stocks, global stocks, bonds, YOLO).***

**TLDR: I think Market Makers got completely screwed today by this sub's unprecedented call buying yesterday. Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM, and realy, a good 8-10m of that need happened in a few minute period which was when the market broke. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole $100-200 million today. And yeah, some people are getting fired. You guys did it - you made the Degenerity! GME hit an all time high price (but not all time high market cap)**

&#x200B;

**Not a short squeeze:**

I don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.

Shorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.

On the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  🚀 ⛽

That's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽

When the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60.  When it hit $60, there was a HUGE amount of options all at once, and market liquidity was insufficient ("The Degenerity"). At the writing of this post in the morning during the halt, it means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge in real time.

In terms of gamma conditions from here, there's no remaining real ramp once you are at around 63.

**Edit #3: Previously said we would see stagnation right under $60 because dealers have an interest in a $60 close and probably own 40m+ shares at this point offsetting the huge short calls - and had to unload 6m shares in ITM calls ending today. But it looks like they either don't care or are losing control with this hot close at $64.75. Going to be a lot of share delivery into Monday, maybe as much as 10m.  That'll be interesting to sort out.**

**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs, probably on the order of $100-200m... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one. You are welcome, you deserve it.**  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

And I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.

I do think MMs will be more careful on this moving forward and make this less likely to repeat. This epic failure on their part is going to attract CIO level oversight. Unlike the meltup last Wednesday where they got to hedge smoothly, they were not able to hedge here.

Also, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has about a year of federal prison left)? Very interesting. Looking forward to his read as someone who's squeezed someone before:

The fact that literally NONE OF THIS IS NEW. 4-5 years ago we where dealing with the same fucking issues. The SEC was trying to shut us down every weekend. If I bought a share of Tesla every time someone thought the “sub was over” when I was here 4 years ago, maybe I’d be rich enough to not give a fuck about you bunch of autists. The only thing that’s changed is that WSB has grown bigger and better, and yes, is now more mainstream, which is something that is a direct result of the core mod teams efforts. As someone who at one point saw behind the scenes, this place is a fucking mess and I can only imagine the type of janitorial work the poor mod team does these days on your behalf now that it’s 20 times the size of what it was back then. It’s really a thankless job, and the mod team has always maintained the core founding principles of this subreddit wether you fucking like it or not, even to the point of ousting the founder. They’ve never been out to profit or interfere with the content and community that exists here and everything they do is for the better good. As far as I’m concerned they can do whatever the fuck they want, including going private with the subreddit whenever they want, which they used to do far more often. For their thankless work and thousands of hours turning this place into the beacon of hope for retail investors that it is, they get absolutely nothing except constant complaints from you whiny bunch and the ability to have some very minor sense of ownership in the entity that exists as we now know - Wallstreetbets. 

Now, let me explain why a Twitter account or some other form of communication is absolutely necessary at this point. It’s happened a million times that I’ve stumbled across fake and deceitful references to Wallstreetbets. Wether it’s that Instagram meme page with close to 150k followers (@WallStBets) that spends all their time ripping memes from here and monetizing that shit to the max, or the multiple trademark and copyright filings by various entities including Reddit itself to control the Wallstreetbets name, there is an immediate need for clarified communication from the mod team and action to prevent fakes and phonies from taking over and encroaching on the good name and people of this subreddit. Again, none of this is new and it’s something that I know was the main focus of moderation efforts back when I was on the team, the problem has just gotten worse since that point. Now, I believe the direction the mod team was taking with the “official” twitter account was slightly fucking retarded and far too curatorial of the actual user submitted content, but that’s just one slightly misguided step in the right direction for something that will eventually need to be done. This sub will only keep growing in size I imagine and questions of who the fuck actually runs the place and makes sure it stays the way it is will only grow larger. One thing the mod team has never been is 100% transparent about what they do, it’s all a bit of a fucking meme in that sense, so you should really stop trying to understand it and just let it happen.

“As we know, viruses change over time, so the appearance of this new variant is not a surprise,” she said. “Again, this is the reason we take a multi-antibody approach in our infectious disease programs, as the virus would need to mutate in two distinct locations to evade the binding and neutralizing capacity of both antibodies.” 

One of Regeneron's antibodies in the cocktail "may be susceptible" to the South African variant, the company's spokeswoman said, but **the other should still work.** That's the "exact idea behind the combination approach," she said, which is to "mitigate risk."

At current EPS, it's P/E assuming it hits the same earnings next quarter would be 17.5. Assuming they hit the same target, which seems very likely given there were more COVID cases than ever in Q4, it should be conservatively priced at 620 and is trading at 545. That's a 14% upside. If the company becomes the only antibody therapy player as this article suggests, they could easily beat and continue to beat earnings estimates, taking the company back to its July high of 660. 

Earnings are 14 days away and Goldman Sachs has a $793 price target on it for 2021.

Listen up you retards, this is a post in the most autistic community on Reddit. I am very clearly NOT a financial advisor. If I was, I wouldn't be here with you degenerates. Do your own research and invest at your own risk.

With that out of the way, let me introduce my moonshot bet of 2021: $RECAF, complete with all the DD my smooth brain could muster up.

&#x200B;

**First, obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Now that I have appealed to the lowest common denominator, onto the real DD.

&#x200B;

**What is RECAF?**

Reconnaissance Energy (Africa) is a junior oil & gas company in Africa.

&#x200B;

**HOLD UP, DID YOU SAY OIL?**

I'm not long on drilling into the Earth for dinosaur dicks either, but this company has the potential for some serious tendies in the short-mid term. Keep reading to find out why.

&#x200B;

**What is special about RECAF?**

They have secured the rights for a 90% interest in the Kavango Sedimentary Basin in Namibia, and 100% interest in a petrol license in Botswana. The two licenses together cover an area of 8.5 MILLION acres.

&#x200B;

**QUICK SMOOTHBRAIN MATHS**

Similar land in the Texas Permian Basin is valued at roughly \~25k/acre. As recently as 2015 is has been valued at \~70k/acre. 24k x 8.5M acres = $200 BILLION+ in market cap potential. Currently the stock is valued at a paltry \~300M market cap despite possibly sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in oil. For you retards that is easy ten-bagger potential.

&#x200B;

**MY WIFE'S BF SAYS THERE IS A REASON IT HASN'T MOONED YET**

There is a reason. Drilling has not started yet. (edit: as u/thetryguy47 pointed out, drilling has technically started, but we are still \~6 weeks away from knowing whether or not there is oil) There is technically a risk they will discover there is in fact no oil to be found. HOWEVER, the chances of this are incredibly slim. It would basically be the only basin in the WORLD of its size and thickness to not contain any commercial hydrocarbons.

We won't know anything for another month or two, but the most conservative estimates have predicted roughly 120 BILLION barrels of oil, and that is off just 12% of the licensed acreage. Oil can go from first tap to full production in less than a year, so the timeline for returns is short enough to satisfy even the most impatient of degenerates on here. [Haywood Capital Markets](https://clients.haywood.com/uploadfiles/secured_reports/RECOJan182021.pdf?inf_contact_key=b19dbaa7c446441fe385e2b2c42f509d680f8914173f9191b1c0223e68310bb1&fbclid=IwAR3SQSzfAoZq_iqNilVdRmmWZ9k8tqVqWY3kkBrFbbMnSp3Sx9HJbrnNx8c) have a price target of $7/share (currently trading at \~$2.90), but I think the potential is even greater.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Buy $RECAF. Massively undervalued and probably sitting on billions of dollars in oil. Relatively low risk, extremely high reward. 🚀🌝

I'm in @ 250 shares myself, will probably be kicking myself this time next year for not YOLO-ing it all._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ride that 🚀🚀 boys! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR 🧻 🤚.

May the odds be ever in our favor  [**u/JimmyGarapEmHoes**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JimmyGarapEmHoes/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀TSM World Domination: Beyond the moon. Don’t call me crazy yet, let me explain.

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Welp _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Holy shit i just turned 18 and put all my money into GME.

Looking good friends. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone not buying CRSR is a retard CRSR is an unbelievably cheap buy, even at 40. Look at their P/E compared to LOGI. Look at their last earnings crush, and compare it to Black Friday + Christmas + numerous product releases (Q4). Tons of volume opened up this morning and it’s going to scream past 60 by earnings.

I tried to tell y’all the other day, and I’m up 80% in my options since then.

Look at LOGI and HEAR earnings, and compare their fundamentals. Look at the latest filing where they basically showed their hand that they are going to DESTROY earnings.

Look at their volume today vs avg volume. Don’t miss this one.

They are getting coverage for their unexpected stock offering, setting the lower bar at $35. Note that this will not dilute stock value, but will reduce volatility, which is arguably much needed for this stock. Logitech (competitor) also beat expectations, though the price moved little after this became known. 

Corsair has adjusted guidance, indicating they've beat projected expectations for Q4 earnings.

If you listen to past earnings calls, the C-suite sounds smart and experienced, with an eye for future markets (streaming and coaching in e-sports and live stream channels). I build pc's for personal use and was surprised how many parts were Corsair when I recently updated: RAM, power supply, fans and case, all CRSR. Christmas sales will probably  be  focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

Small(ish) market cap, media buzz around the company and a lower threshold established close to the current market price, three weeks before an earnings report they've said they will beat--what else do you need to know?

TLDR: buy CRSR, it was a solid play a week ago, more solid today.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $37.78

(BlackBerry is in both). BlackBerry’s market cap is only at 7 billion, yes only 7 billion...it should be at 100 billion, because stocks are supposed to be investments for future earnings...100 billion market cap would put BlackBerry at a share price of $180 US ...crowdstrike which earns the same amount as BlackBerry is at a 50 billion market cap, and if you evaluate the vehicle side of BlackBerry and Amazon partnership to be 50 billion dollars additional market cap (I believe it’s worth more) then you have 50 + 50 = 100 billion market cap evaluation

Probably also because of the gambling). 

**The Pledge** 

I was sleeping with a Chinese girl and she told me to invest in Billi Billi (BILI) and BIDU. Obviously I didn't because 'The China Hustle'/CCP etc. etc. Obviously both stocks then boomed. Only did DD (Deep Dicking) and no DD. I did throw into FUTU because of some glorious DD from the King [u/dhsmatt2]. Took profit @ 60% gains, should have stayed on like a thong. 

Lesson: divesting from China is morally right, it's also not very profitable. Some of these companies are full of magic pudding. 

Youdao (DAO) is the dictionary app **everyone** has on their phone/desktop. Seriously Chinese people love this company. They also make hardware and run online learning courses (largest source of revenue). The company was spun off from NetEase (a big baller) in 2019. 

**The Turn** 

Youdao is 2x undervalued relative to its peers and and has posted incredible, yet believable, growth. Compare this to GSX Techedu which is likely a total scam, and DAO is likely to benefit from their inevitable downfall. They have a solid management team, and a massive marketing push over the Summer is going to show big numbers in Q4. 

Unlike their rivals they are a purely online play, which is bullish in the Covid/future paradigm. Especially as cases in China start rising again. Education is also something the Chinese will always invest in, and invest bigly. 

They are reporting losses, investing back into the business and targeting growth. They have a few big competitors, but Youdao has the name recognition and technical edge to grow bigger/faster. 

**The Prestige** 

I'm not qualified to give out PTs, but I am into this because think this play will appreciate \~50% in the short term and double/3x by EoY. Solidish fundamentals, growth, industry and the fact it is currently unloved is my very Bullish ground-floor thesis. 

I enjoy DD, and that's why I wrote this. Invest or don't, up to you didgeridoo.  Um abraço._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD - NCLH: Room for Growth There is some serious opportunity with NCLH right now, it’s made significant progress since the bottom of the pandemic, but it’s still at less than half its price since pre-COVID. I’ve been in and out of the stock and made some good money since the initial drop, but I’m now going long (6 months - year) for the following reasons:

1. Room for growth: as mentioned, it has rebounded some, but still less than half its original price. Unlike some other stocks that will never make it back to pre pandemic levels due to market disruption (think movie theaters, etc.) this one cannot be replaced with a ‘virtual experience’. Additionally, this one had a great upward trend and growth before the pandemic. If things can return to semi-normal, I see performance following the same pattern. 

2. Pent up Demand: yes, this is going to be demo-specific. But for people who have been vaccinated and/or just don’t care about corona that much, I see an explosion in bookings once things are able to get going again. Most of the delays to cruising at this point are being self imposed by NCLH, as opposed to the government, which is a good sign. Once we see critical mass for vaccinations, I see this thing booming.

3. Cash Reserves: NCLH has large cash reserves to weather another year or so of no-cruising, without any new financing or cuts. Yes, the pandemic could rage for another year, but I think we’re going to see much bigger and more widespread problems if that happens.

4. Politics: This one is iffy, but I really believe Trump was a bit of a scapegoat for Rona..yea it happened on his watch, but how much better would anyone really have done? Anyway...I truly believe now that Sleepy Joe is in, the media will start making everything ‘good news’ about the virus. This, combined with the increased vaccinations, will make for some great gains on pure hype alone over the coming months.

tl;dr: long (9-12 months) NCLH_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’d like to thank WSB for these 💎 🙌 and tendies. I’m no u/deepfuckingvalue but I’m doing my part 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is CRSR the next short squeeze? Is CRSR the next short squeeze? Or did some of us miss it in December? Is it possible that this may be the next short squeeze gamers are very passionate about their companies (me included). Corsair makes great stuff for computers both hardware and peripheral. I was looking at this stock this morning and according to TD its at about 36.48 Short float on DEC 30th. Yahoo however had a very different number at only 6%. another short squeeze is less likely i know but how does our community feel about the CRSR stock overall. Not anything other then what noticed while doing a little lite DD lets discuss.

TLDR: just my opinion CRSR looks ripe to me

Thank you fellow autists and retards lets get some monies or be homeless.

Edit: I hold no position but am looking into making a purchase not looking to pump just discussing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PayPal earnings, coming out February 3rd, will be mind-blowing!!!! We have seen a tremendous rise in the price of (the asset that starts with a B and can't be named on this forum) immediately following the launch of PayPal's ("B") offering. Many people used PayPal to buy "B" during the run up in December (PayPal had a large social media marketing push too).

Unlike Square, PayPal has almost no cost associated with their B offering. They partnered with Paxos who is the custodian exchanging the B and managing the accounts. PayPal is just reselling Paxos' product and taking a fee on top. Easy to implement, provides a large new revenue stream, and 0 risk for PayPal.

When Square posted its earnings following a B rally last year, Square stock skyrocketed and analysts raised their targets. I predict we will see even greater returns for PayPal.

I just put half my stack on PayPal call options expiring Feb 5th. Yolo!!!

I also have a $240 call expiring 4/16 and a $260 call expiring 1/21/22. I plan on holding these for a while tho as I think PayPal has a lot of room to grow off the B play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Update on GME VSA I made a post yesterday about watching interest at highs.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to update this mornings trading so far made new highs (during NYSE on-hours) on low volume relative to previous volumes.

&#x200B;

I can't see off market volume in relation to open hours charts. Take that into consideration.

&#x200B;

TLDR = Relatively low interest at highs = no ceiling yet for rockets

Some significant volume at what COULD be a high. Volume the highest over the last 3 days of trading, but not exactly climactic in terms of the last two weeks of trading.

&#x200B;

If this is indeed a high, I would expect a retracement and then look for buying interest to come back in, hopefully.

This is what significant volume looks like. 

However, as I am typing this price just broke this high volume candle.

Volume coming in but overwhelming demand it looks like steamrolling. Some big dick boomer just hit buy because his son on wsb convinced him.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Posted yesterday when it was $11. NNDM is mooning! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JPMorgan Upgrades Ford (F) to Overweight with target of $14 🚀💎🌈 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tendies 4 Mai Tiddies 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😁😁😁😁 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD Gang Since 2013 This post contains no numbers and no news. This I is about my experience with AMD and what I think the future holds for them based on what I see in the industry. 

In 2013 I bought a gaming PC from my neighbor at a garage sale. The PC had an AMD FX 8350 in it. I spent around $1k on the PC upgrading everything. To this day, the PC still has that same AMD FX processor. Before everyone jumped on the Ryzen hype, I was there, believing. When I got the PC I told my dad to buy $100 worth of AMD stock for me. They were worth a dollar something at the time. They are now worth around $100 a share. Sadly, I didn’t make the Tendies from then investment when I was a kid who saw potential in AMD. 

On July 6th of this 2020, I bought in myself because i knew how great the company was from year of experience. I have been holding ever since and will continue to hold and buy in. AMD, in my mind, is undervalued. Not because of technical analysis or earnings. But because of what I see in the real world. Friends of mine who bought and built PC’s back when I did, had Intel CPU’s in their PC’s. Some of them have never even heard of AMD processors. Between then and now. All of my friends who have upgraded their PC’s have switched to AMD. Everyone who knows a thing or two about PC’s at least considers going AMD instead of Intel. 

You might be thinking it’s too late to buy now, too late to invest in AMD. Your loss. AMD is starting to do the same thing with Graphics Cards, laptops and Server parts that they did with gaming CPU’s. I foresee them having the same takeover they had with gaming CPU’s in the laptop, GPU, and server chip space. The potential is huge. Big cloud  companies like Amazon, Google etc. are starting to switch their servers from Intel Xeon to AMD Epyc. This can make AMD much more money than gaming processors. I don’t know much about Xilinx but i believe if AMD follows the same philosophy they do with their other chips, they can bring Xilinx to the top. AMD had a lot further to go. 🚀🚀

GME SHARES PURCHASED
https://imgur.com/a/WZ3O6Hr

First, forgive me for my cowardice. I should have joined you earlier but I was afraid. I am new to this. In time I hope to grow massive balls like you lot.

I also want to thank citron and andrew cleft. After yesterday’s ‘live stream’ I felt he lacked conviction in his belief, this was evident in the way he spoke. A lot of Ah’s and Um’s, complete lack of charisma and confidence. Subjective but still. That and he did say some stupid things like issuing more shares to pay down debt. Which generally you don’t do (but can). He shouldn't be giving management advice if his goal is to short a share. The most important thing is this, conviction and faith. Have that, which he, and to point I lacked. Already you have seen people who had the balls to jump in make gainz.  Also as u/An_EliteMind_Ihope pointed out, citron is clearly lying, thank you for sharing this friend. 

Also want to thank u/DeepFuckingValue for his hard work. If I miss anybody I apologize. I usually lurk here.

The other thing I want to share is for anyone that was afraid to invest. A few days ago I sold about 814 shares of Nio and realized a gain of about $41,901. I apologize for the proof.

https://imgur.com/a/VFryR9L

Here in Canada half of that is taxable so $20,950. I originally sold to buy BB and PLTR. I still have positions in NIO, I do believe in it and I like how the company is being managed. However, I also purchased GME. The point is this if I get a loss I can net that against my gains. I’d rather make more money than pay my incompetent government taxes.  Since it is the beginning of 2021 I won’t have to pay taxes till like May or April of 2022. It also gives me a whole year to sit on this and realize those gains/losses when I need to. Plenty of time to get my shit in order. At the same time, you don’t have to sell. If you get a loss eventually any other position might gain that allows you to plan things out long term. If these companies are doing things you like ride it out. Ride to die. Don’t be a coward. As you have seen others have sold on  poisitions to diversify too.  Just some incentive for you folks. Now I am in Canada, and I am sure the US has similar tax rules. 

That is all I really wanted to say. This last bit is personal. I know I have bugged some of you guy’s for guidance and advice. I want to throw this out there. I do want to get into options trading or learn how to do analysis like you guys. I have somewhat learned by reading these threads and studying independently. I don’t care about being rich, I just hate being a loser in my 30’s. I am the son of immigrants, and all I have wanted to do is provide for and take care of my family. I want you to understand that so if you have some guidance or knowledge that has helped you please please dm me. That is all._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why GME might squeeze to 400$? 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 I am a retard trying to understand short squeeze

As per Yahoo finance, the total float is **47M**. The total shares shorted as of Dec 30 is **71M**. A lot of the insiders e.g. **RC** won’t sell their shares irrespective of squeeze. The total outstanding share stands at **69M**. Even if the management decided to offer **20M** shares, it still does not seem enough to cover short positions.

So, how will the short position be covered ? Buying the same shares multiple times? Can someone explain ?

If management does offer a certain amount of shares directly to hedge funds, can those shares be traded in the open market? If they can't rinse and repeat, then an offering from management still does not seem enough to cover short positions.

Now, GME management is fully aware of the situation. So, at what price point do we expect them to offer more shares considering they can dictate prices. Let's say, they offer 20M shares @ 200 raising 4B. That would be enough to pay off all debts and GME will have 3B in cash. However, since these shares won't be enough, the prices should still continue to rise.

That's why I think even though a price of 400$ seems highly unlikely, it is possible.

Here’s what we know. 

Canoo - $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai to provide them with their B2B skateboard platform for their new electric cars. This is great and all, but let’s be honest, we’re not moving away from GME for a fucking Hyundai here. All you fuckers have Lambos and Tesla’s already, no time for that shit. 

So here we are back in the glory days of February 2020. TSLA, SPCE, PLUG, and Lumber Liquidators were rocketing 🚀🚀🚀 off to the moon 🌖. No wearing a fucking mask all day, we could drink with our friends, pass a blunt, and snort cocaine off hookers asses without first having to douse them in sanitizer. Ah the good ol days... anyways back to this gem of a deal that has brought us to where we are today. 

Hyundai and Canoo collaborate and agree to use Canoo’s skateboard platform for their upcoming EVs. See article below;

[Hyundai News Release](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982)

Also check out the skateboard (slick marketing, very inline with a fruit named company 🍎)

[Slick as fuck Skateboard video](https://youtu.be/3ucsFNUTqtM)

Now I know your pants are starting to get a little tight or damp, and that’s ok, but stay with me here. 

Hyundai acquired Kia back in the 90’s, as a whole they sell about 7 million or so cars a year. They have set a goal of 25% of their cars sold to be electric by 2025 (not that far away). 

For those who can somehow read, but aren’t so good with this things that aren’t letters but are used in math. Let’s do some for you. 

7,000,000 cars x 25% = 1,750,000 that’s like, over a million for the folks above. Now I’m sure you’re wondering where the fuck are my rockets??? 🚀🚀🚀 There have a couple to keep you going through the next bit. 

Let’s move ahead to current day, world’s a fucking mess 😷, but Shittron is eating some of that 💩 for breakfast because they’re broke as fuck after trying to short GME. 🌈🐻s have all realized Stonks only go 📈, and they’re looking for a way to rebuild their kids education fund after blowing it all on puts. Apple has decided they want some of that dirty Tesla action, and head out looking for a way to get into the electric car business. Not knowing how the fuck you actually make a car, they go out looking for someone who does since they hope to be selling 400,000 cars by 2025ish. Here comes Hyundai, yeah they used to make shitboxes that no one other than Shittron employees and 🌈🐻s would drive, but now they’re stepping up their game. They’ve partnered with this up and coming company, who are doing some pretty cool shit - Canoo. 

So hypothetically Apple has been rumoured to be working with Hyundai/Kia for their new car, who had partnered with Canoo to use their skateboard as a base. So here we are with this little stonk with a market cap of somewhere around $4 Billion and a $17 share price. 

[Article about Apple working with Hyundai/Kia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/)

Skip this if you don’t want numbers, but I think you’re going to like this part. 

Canoo is going to be making some cars, yeah cool, whatever. The real value in here though is their B2B skateboard platform for EVs. We already figured out if Hyundai is selling 1.75 Million cars, and Apple wants another 400k or so, we’re now over 2 million cars a year. I’m going to go ahead and guess that this skateboard is worth somewhere conservatively between 5,000 - 10,000 (Canoo has already said their cars will cost 33,000, so I’ve estimated but let’s call it $7,500). 

2 million cars x $7,500 = A whole lot of fucking 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Or give or take $15,000,000,000 yup $15 Billion fucking 💵. We’ll go with a revenue multiplier of 5x because I think that’s fair. 

5 x 15,000,000,000 = $75,000,000,000 Valuation. 

Let’s remember today’s market cap is $4 Billion. 4B x 18.75 = 75B again for all you simple folks out there that’s 18 full rockets 

🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

So is this Tesla, not yet, but am I in for a potential 18x ride to the moon? Fucking right I am! 

Now let’s show this little stonk some love, and make some fucking Millionaires. 

TLDR 

GOEV = 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick.

Will Disney+ make this company a must have? What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~ \~Don't read if you hate long posts!\~**

Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney’s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what’s the upside for the stock! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

Let’s start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.

Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks & experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks & streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.

So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.

Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.

They announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney & Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).

The company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).

Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android & Apple devices, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google’s devices.

The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven’t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN+.

Hulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads & live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.

They also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.

But guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.

Despite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarterly & yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment & the Park, Experiences & Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.

Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top & bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media & Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.

I also used the Depreciation & Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.

So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For Disney’s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks & Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 & 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let’s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

**Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! Have a great day and see you next time❗**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The ultimate meme stock, $WOOF! WSB Idiot DD $WOOF!

It's more than just a funny ticker name, it's a lifestyle. From the time I was a young boy, I knew that dogs would one day rule the world. The four-legged barking fuckers stole the hearts of humans and just ripped them right out, especially when they did something cute.

And then last week, something amazing happened. PETCO went public again, under the ticker name $WOOF.

**Why the fuck should you listen to me?**

I'm the clown that's been calling all of the non-GME (and GME things) things that have been making money in the discord these past few weeks. I'm the guy that brought you:

* PLUG
* FCEL
* ICLN
* BNGO
* TLRY, APHA, and other weed stocks
* Other shit

**What's so great about this company?**

First and foremost, obviously, the ticker. But beyond that, the company itself has undergone an incredible transformation, moving from a brick-and-mortar retail store to offering pet health and pet care services (not just retail ones, higher quality ones), and moving into more advanced pet care, such as theraputics.

A few points:

* PETCO's annual revenue in 2019 was $4.43B
* Their market cap isn't even 2x revenue, at $7.9B - spelling out that this stock is MASSIVELY undervalued
* Their top competitor, CHEWY, had revenue of $3.5B, but a market cap of $40B - more than 10x its revenue.
* PETCO, a traditional brick and mortar business, has massively grown it's e-commerce platform. As an example of this, in October of 2020, it had almost 20 million website visits, compared to about 20% of that in October of 2019.
* This company has existed since 1965, and while other similar businesses have faltered, they have stayed open.
* Pet ownership has increased more than 21% during COVID (thanks u/fallenangel51294), and young people spend more on their pets.

**What the fuck do I have invested?**

A group of us on the WSB Discord have nearly 20,000 shares combined, plus options. Best list I can come up with, below:

* 2,500 shares at $26.50 average
* 11,000 shares at $27.50 average
* 5,000 shares at $29.50 average
* We've also seen a few users buying 2/19 and 3/19 30c.

**What else is there to know?**

This is an IPO, almost 90% of which have been highly successful in recent years, including $WOOF's primary competitors.

**Target Price?**

Some analysts are suggesting this is worth $70, others $100. If I had to guess, this stock could reach $30ish-$35 EOM, and go even further in Feb/Mar.

*Obviously, I'm just another idiot on the internet. Do your own DD if you want, but I'm heavily into WOOF.*

***TO THE MOON*** 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR set to launch??🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How luck plays an important role in the stock market (GME and others) Fellow retards,

I noticed that this sub is going to hit 2 million people soon, and I have decided to put aside my project assignments to write this DD (albeit more towards psychologically) on why luck is extremely important in the stock market, and what you can do to potentially get in favor of luck. Before I start, I want to congratulate you on being here. You have came a long way in life, and there’s more to come. Be happy.

**TLDR at the last paragraph.**

I want to talk mainly 3 things; luck, the psychology behind investing and what you should do to maximize profits. 

**Luck**

In the book 'The Drunkard's Walk', under chapter of 'Illusions of Patterns and Patterns of Illusion', and I quote: "In 1978, Koppett revealed a system that he claimed could determine, by the end of January every year, whether the stock market would go up or down in that calendar year. His system had correctly predicted the market, he said, for the past eleven years. Of course, stock-picking systems are easy to identify in hindsight; the true test is whether they will work in the future. Koppett's system passed that test too: judging the market by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it worked for eleven straight years, from 1979 through 1989, got it wrong in 1990, and was correct again every year until 1998. But although Koppett's predictions were correct for a streak of eighteen out of nineteen years, I feel confident in asserting that his streak involved no skill whatsoever. Why? Because Leonard Koppett was a columnist for *Sporting News*, and his system was based on the results of the Super Bowl, the championship game of professional football. Whenever the team from the (original) National Football league won, the stock market, he predicted, would rise."

In the book 'Fooled by Randomness', the Prologue mentioned "...luck disguised and perceived as nonluck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). "

In the book ‘The Black Swan’ by Taleb Nassim Nicholas, Page 119 mentioned " A successful person will try to convince you that his achievements could not possibly be accidental, just as a gambler who wins at roulette seven times in a row will explain to you that the odds against such a streak are one in several million, so you either have to believe some transcendental intervention is in play or accept his skills and insight in picking the winning numbers." More often than not, luck is rarely on your side. I can provide many other articles, but I believe you get the point. **To emphasize it, "the habit of mistaking luck for skill is most prevalent - and most conspicuous - and that is the world of markets."**

So why am I saying all these? What I am trying to imply is, do appreciate your GME gains, or whatever astronomical gains that you have. These gains, more often than not, are results of extremely lucky happenstances, where most people are incapable of harnessing them. Yes, there are tons of good DDs. But you yourselves are incredibly lucky to be part of WSB, and personally reading the DDs yourselves, and lucky enough to decide that you would be retarded enough to take the risk. You should be happy and grateful about it, because like I said, this is hugely, and heavily dependent on luck. Humans are flawed, because we have the tendency to look for specific causes that lead to effects. We often find it hard to accept that an event can be the result of total randomness, but sometimes it is. In financial forecasting, several times random volatility is mistaken for accurate prediction. In a group of many analysts, it is normal to expect that someone's predictions will turn out to be true (u/DeepFuckingValue). So, in case you get way too ahead of yourselves thinking you are absolutely a genius for having triple percentage gains in your portfolio, remember you're most likely just lucky. And since you're lucky, be appreciative and do not be complacent. 

**Psychology behind Investing**

Several studies have fooled people into believing they are in control of something they actually have no control over. In fact, human decision-making shows systematic simplifications and deviations from the tenets of rationality (‘heuristics’) that may lead to suboptimal decisional outcomes (‘cognitive biases’). There are currently three prevailing theoretical perspectives on the origin of heuristics and cognitive biases: a cognitive-psychological, an ecological and an evolutionary perspective. To simplify that, it basically means that cognitive biases arise from intrinsic brain mechanisms that are fundamental for the working of our neural networks. Your mind is always on the cautious side of things, because it is trying to protect you.

Remember a time when you were very near the edge of a building/cliff, and all of a sudden you feel hypersensitive to the surrounding around you? You are aware of every rocks and stones that might sabotage you. Another example can be that you shiver when peeing, because your body is exaggerating the signal that you are rapidly losing body heat, and is trying to shiver up the muscle fiber to keep you warm, etc. You get the idea. 

This unfortunately, applies in investing as well. Your mind will inevitably forces you to be on the safer side. A dip? Oh no... you panic. But relax, that is normal. In my last point, I will explain what you can do to overcome it.

**What you can do to stay calm?**

So now you know that it is in human nature to be a paper handed bitch. The first step is realizing that your own neural networks are playing a huge part in giving you a paper hand. When you realized that it is your own mind that is keeping you on the safer side, perhaps you can be more self-aware. Being impatient in the market is the worst mistake that you would commit while investing in the stocks. You have to know that if you do not have good patience in the market then you would find difficulty in getting the right stocks for your investment. You have to finally take your own decisions when you wish to select the stocks. Remember however, you do have to be lucky to hit the jackpot on certain investments as per my first point. 

Confirmation bias is also a bitch. As philosopher Francis Bacon put it in 1620, "the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken." This happens very often in WSB, and I want you to be cautious as well. To show you how easy confirmation bias is, imagine I have 5 numbers here. After presenting you these numbers, I want you to guess what is the rule of the game. Here are the 5 numbers: 4 6 8 10 12. What will your next 3 numbers be? What is the rule of the game? The rule is: &gt;!Increasing Numbers, the next 3 numbers can be 13 14 15!&lt; Most of you might have guessed "increasing even numbers and provided with 14 16 18, when in fact it is not. 

Luck does not solely come from deciding whether to listen to another retard's DD on a thread, and YOLO-ing your life savings onto some stocks. It also comes in the form of your birth status, etc. Having a $100,000 head start in the stock market, is almost always better than someone having $1000 as a starting capital (or worse still, negative capital simply because your parents are poor, that's unlucky).

That being said, I believe all of us here are in some way privileged to be gathered here and discussing individually. The poor kids in some countries have to fight for clean water and food. So the next time you realized that you are earning money in the stock market, remember, it is incredibly hard to do it, and you should be proud of yourselves. And in the scenario where you lose your money, well, you shouldn't be surprised either way. You are bound to be losing. 

Here are some books you can refer to if you're interested: The Drunkard’s Walk by Leonard Mlodinow (How Randomness Rules Our Lives), Fooled by Randomness by Taleb N, The Black Swan by Taleb N, Who’s in Charge? by Michael S. Gazzaniga (on Free will and the science of the brain), Success and Luck by Robert H. Frank, The Most Good You Can Do (How effective altruism is changing ideas about living ethically) by Peter Singer. 

Clarification: Some people mentioned if this post was directed to "diminish the contributions of skill and the hard effort of anyone". Absolutely not. ~~This post is assuming that in the top few % (if you're reading this, yourself included), everyone is just as talented.~~ But to be part of that 1% in that 1%, to be the richest among the richest, you have to be incredibly lucky. 

**TLDR**: If you make huge gains, go and give some of it to other people that may not have been so lucky. Go and give it to the homeless people at the unemployment line, who ain't so lucky as you. Maybe buy him food. Get him clothes. Donate to your local charities. Most importantly, give it back to your parents, because your parents are the one who, most likely, set you up in this direction, and you are lucky enough to be here today. If you did not make any gains, remember, it is perfectly okay.

**Shorter TLDR**: Be happy, be grateful.

QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don’t renew the system, you won’t be able to drive it? That’s a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it’s very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto’s systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it’s just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BBBY and BEYOND!

One day a fellow named Paper Hands rushed into the office, typed out an order on Robinhood and sent it. Then he rushed over to where Mr. Diamond Hands was listening politely to Jimmy Shill's story of the time he overheard some autist give an order to one of his brokers and all that Jimmy made was a measly thirty points on a hundred shares of TSLA and of course the stock had to go up twenty-four hundred points in three months right after Jim sold out. It was at least the fourth time that Jim had told him that  tale of woe, but old 33-year old Diamond Hands (aka u/deepfuckingvalue) was smiling as sympathetically as if it was  the first time he heard it. 

Well, Paper Hands made for the old chad and, without a word of apology to Jimmy Shill, told u/deepfuckingvalue, “Mr. Diamond Hands, I have just sold my GME shares. My people say the market is entitled to a reaction and that I’ll be able to buy it back cheaper. So you’d better do likewise. That is,  if you’ve still got yours.” 

Paper Hands looked suspiciously at the chad to whom he had given the  original tip to buy. The amateur, or gratuitous, tipster always thinks  he owns the receiver of his tip body and soul, even before he knows how the tip is going to turn out. 

“Yes, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands, I still have it. Of course!” said u/deepfuckingvalue gratefully. It was nice of Paper Hands to think of the old chad. “Well, now is  the time to take your profit and get in again on the next dip,” said Paper Hands, as if he had just made out the sell market-order for the old chad. 

Failing to perceive enthusiastic gratitude in the beneficiary’s face Paper Hands went on: “I have just sold every share I owned!” From his voice  and manner you would have conservatively estimated it at ten thousand  shares. 

But Mr. Diamond Hands shook his head regretfully and whined, “No! No! I can’t do that!” 

“What?” yelled Paper Hands. 

“I simply can’t!” said Mr. Diamond Hands. He was in great trouble. 

“Didn’t I give you the tip to buy it?” 

“You did, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands, and I am very grateful to you. Indeed, I am, sir. But” 

“Hold on! Let me talk! And didn’t that stock go up twenty points in ten days? Didn’t it?” 

“It did, and I am much obliged to you, my dear boy. But I couldn’t think of selling that stock.” 

“You couldn’t?” asked Paper Hands, beginning to look doubtful himself. It is a habit with most tip givers to be tip takers. 

“No, I couldn’t.” 

“Why not?” And Paper Hands drew nearer.

**“Why, this is a retard-strength bull market!”** The old fellow said it  as though he had given a long and detailed explanation. “That’s all right,” said Paper Hands, looking angry because of his disappointment. “I know  this is a retarded bull market as well as you do. But you’d better sell that stock of yours and buy it back on the reaction. You might as well  reduce the cost to yourself.” “My dear boy,” said old u/deepfuckingvalue, in  great distress **“my dear boy, if I sold that stock now I’d lose my position; and then where would I be?”**  Paper Hands threw up his little pussy hands, shook his head and walked over to me to get sympathy… “I give him a tip on Gamestop. He buys fifty thousand shares. He’s got 35 points profit and I advise him to get out and buy ’em back on the reaction that’s overdue even now. And what does he say when I tell him? He says that if he sells he’ll lose his *tendies*. What do you know about that?” 

“I beg your pardon, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands; I didn’t say I’d lose my *tendies*,” cut  in old u/deepfuckingvalue. “I said I’d lose my position. And when you are as old as I  am and you’ve been through as many booms and panics as I have, you’ll  know that to lose your position is something nobody can afford; not even Papa Elon.

I hope the stock reacts and that you will be able to repurchase your  line at a substantial concession, sir. But I myself can only trade in  accordance with the experience of many years. I paid a high price for it  and I don’t feel like throwing away a second tuition fee, especially at boomer valuations. But I am as  much obliged to you as if I had the money in the bank. **It’s a retard-strength bull market, you know.**” 

And he moonwalked away, leaving Paper Hands dazed. What old Mr. Diamond Hands said did not mean much to me until I began to think about my own  numerous failures to make as much money as I ought to when I was so right on the memestonk market. The more I studied the more I realized how  wise that old chad was. 

He had evidently suffered from the same defect in his young days and  knew his own human bi-curious bear weaknesses. He would not lay himself open to a  temptation that experience had taught him was hard to resist and had  always proved expensive to him, as it was to me.

I think it was a long step forward in my trading education when I  realized at last that when old Mr. Diamond Hands kept on telling the other retards, “**Well, you know this is a retard-strength bull market!**” he really meant to  tell them that the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements that is, not in reading the crayon drawings, but in sizing up  the entire market's fed-steroid-injected, retard-strength, bigly gigantic hulk dick and its trend. 

And right here let me say one thing: After spending many years in  Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me.  It always was my 💎🙌. Got that?

\- Highest trade volume out of all brokers for multiple years, this trend isn't going anywhere (nearly doubled 2nd place broker), resulting in more opportunities to earn revenue

* High volatility is great for the business and while we likely won't see 2020 levels, they'll probably still be higher than the years prior to that at least until a few months after the money printer gets unplugged
* They might also be able to do something with all the data they're collecting but idk

\- Cash flow positive with EPS significantly higher than dividends so there's room for dividend growth there, currently just under 4% yield

* If dividends increase, the price will likely follow

\- High ROE (29% Fwd.) and P/B multiple is much lower than other brokers when compared with a regression, showing potential for multiple expansion (figure 1) from 1.7x to 3.0x

* 3.0x P/B is implied but it's doubtful it'll get that high because the comps are much larger and less volatile
* Comps median is 1.4x P/B

\- Used high cashflow from 2020 to reduce debt and will be using it for share repurchases up to $100mm, though I doubt they'll use all of this up

\- Trading at 5.9x forward P/E, compared to its median over the last 4 years of 7.2x (figure 2) and its comps median of 11.2x, so there might also be room for multiple expansion here too

I’m surprised I haven’t see more acknowledgment that $PENN is now opening up legal gambling in Michigan today... home only to one of the biggest Degens / our future president, Dave Portnoy

Michigan Barstool Sports Book opening today:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/penn-national-penn-launch-sports-141902701.html


We just had a $128 upgrade

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/penn-national-gaming-rises-on-credit-suisse-outperform-rating


I also should point out that this guy - Andrew Cuomo, is now open to the idea of bringing sports betting to NY. Who is the one person in NYC that is doing amazing things for everyone in the U.S? The Barstool Fund. Barstool. Sports degen community base, large. Barstool/ PENN =my future yolo play. 

ONLY DOWNSIDE. Cramer likes them.

Cramer said he thought the stock would go down because of the downgrade to sell by the analyst at Loop Capital. "I would buy the stock because Michigan gambling is about to start next week. It's a $16 billion company which is very little versus the opportunity. I would buy some now and some later betting that maybe another company downgrades it. This downgrade was your chance to buy the stock, and so many people took it before I could get more people in it."

Notice how he uses the word “betting” and he’s been talking about his sports bets on squawk box in the morning lately 👀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BABA currently undervalued? I know we’re in the war against 🍋 and 🧻🤲for $GME but I can’t help but bring your attention to $BABA. 

Although it’s in the spotlight for its anti-trust investigations, they have been beating analyst estimates for earnings and this company undoubtedly has solid fundamentals.

I’m currently planning to start a small position in $BABA as it can very well be the biggest $AMZN competitor! Thoughts on this? $BABA to the moon? 🚀

P.S. I currently own 148 shares in GME and am planning to add more in our fight to achieve the MOASS!! 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Putting GME in perspective as an investment So apart from the potential short squeeze I was comparing GME with other companies.

For instance ABNB has 100 billion market cap, a revenue of less than 5 billion, is losing money, and revenue growth is questionable amid pandemic.

GME has 3 billion market cap, 5 billion revenue, could be profitable soon, and revenue growth is almost guaranteed with console supercycle and new business and product lines. Yet, ABNB market cap is 30-40x times that of GME just because it is a “unicorn”.

Seems to me GME is way undervalued, or ABNB is way overvalued, or maybe both.

Any thoughts?

Position 1500 shares adding 100 more today._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Remember we're not selling for just 420.69 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Future of WSB **I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**

&#x200B;

* too much publicity

WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?

* too many new wannabe autists

WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.

* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets

Anyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.

&#x200B;

**How to fix this?**

1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.
2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.
3. GME to the moon
4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.
5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.

&#x200B;

positions:

pronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Diversified enoif? GME 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next steps for WSB and GME Hello there fellow degenerates, seen as we successfully shafted shitron I feel like it's time for a post to discuss this sub's true potential. A lot of us are absolute autists who scream reeeeeeee when we hear Mr Andrew 'cuckhold' (as his wife calls him) Left and order him pizzas or make tinder accounts for him (poor fucker won't be getting action any other way but please don't keep doing this). However the success of this sub is down to a couple of things:

1. How diverse the audience is, we have VC, boomer general Jim Cramer, bankers, yolo artists, lawyers, engineers, astrophysists, doctors (helo lol) and the true heros those wendy's employees who're making the major returns from diving dickfirst into every DD with  🚀🚀🚀🚀. This means we have serious power in influencing the market, not just because there are 1.9m of us, a lot of people don't follow the page and the true autists amongst us didn't just throw our student loans into GME, they got their friends to as well. So I believe as mentioned previously by some huge nerd we're probably acting as a MM when we work together.
2. Big firms know about the impact WSB has, and some of the intelligent ones will join us for the ride, more will join in the future. This means soon dumping your load into the most mentioned ticker on this sub will almost guarantee you gains.
3. GME is the first real test of whether we can turn a stock around in value mostly on our own as retail investors, because most boomers don't see any potential here, if we do get this fucker to $100+ they'll shit their pants and take notice for sure. Imagine seeing the most mentioned WSB tickers on Mad Money lol.
4. We need to continue holding GME and continue to buy MORE, this is the only way the price of GME doesn't fall to 30s, and if it gets to low 30's there's a risk of paper handed motherfuckers wiping their ass with the stock. This means that WSB will lose it's market influence and shitron can say they're right for once.
5. What most of the boomers seem to forget is that the market stays irrational for way longer than they realise. They stick to stats, which may help you get a modest return in a year but major gains are caused by irrational behaviour and logic. There's no exact science here, there'll always be a probability you'll lose due to irrational moves in the stock, what WSB has done is become that irrational move so the boomers are pissed.
6. DON'T get influenced by the paid off media, half the articles you read are sponsored by the shorts, they are shitting themselves HARD. We pushed GME up 10% even when shitron tried to make his cuckhold argument against GME. They're trying their best to manipulate the market i.e. us so that we stay poor af. Fuck. The. Boomers. They've been pouring capital into trying to convince us to paper hands but all we need is one tweet of a fucking nut by RC and the stock jumps.
7. EDIT: Having been caught up on the nightly drama, please don't post how great WSB is on social media, keep it to this reddit. If we want to make tendies for months or hopefully years to come then we've got to keep our shitposting to this subreddit, we're at a tipping point people. That being said I think it'd be quite hard to stamp us out, even if the SEC tries shutting the subreddit down, which I don't think is probable (hopefully).

HOLD GME TILL DEATH 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 We will be going to the moon lads. Pos: 378 shares @ 17.05 GME.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CLSK potential reversal to $40-50 after a hit piece on them Alright since I got attacked instantly in prior post, I deleted and am amending. Apologies.. wasn't trying to instigate. I genuinely think this is a good play. But again take it as you please.

Cleanspark had a hit piece on them last week. The research firm Culper Research has had terrible track record they are 0 for 8 on success of their previous short reports. For example, put a report out on BLNK in the summer, went down initially, and it then mooned to $60.

Cleanspark is a microgrid clean energy software and hardware company, so incoming policy and administration are on their side. They have a relatively decent balance sheet for a small cap. Acquired a mining center in December that has been profitable very quickly.  It has gone from $40 to $25 area after the hit piece, management responded yesterday  so th dust is settling.

I'm currently only shares and have been adding  since the hit piece. I will dabble in some OTM leaps, looking at $40-50 strike area.

There has been some chaos surrounding GME as most of us are well aware. Big money is under water and they are VERY mad. They're going to great lengths to manipulate WSB, other retail GME bulls and the stock itself. 

Shorts lost $800 million on Wednesday alone which means Thursdays price action put them at a loss in the Billions (these numbers come from a retard with a particularly smooth brain trying math). **They're desperate**, which is evident by Shitrons embarrassing live stream and his urgency in trying to convince people the stock is worth $20. They are trying to strike fear into investors who don't have conviction in GME to encourage them to sell and take profits.

They reek of desperation and sadness which means their positions ***probably*** expire today, Friday, Jan 22. I expect a minor sell off to start the day as the paper hands will do what they do,  **I will buy the dip**. 

This is BIGGER than the potential MOASS (which I believe will start today if enough people have true diamond hands). This here is about good vs evil, right vs wrong, David vs Goliath. I will hold every share until we reach a meme number only found on the moon and beyond. I have prepared my peanuts and look forward to our moon landing. I hope to see you there with me, WSB.

69 Shares — JAN 22 call $60 strike x1 contract_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bears are fuk - why institutional money is following Ryan Cohen [GME DD] Yes, we do need another DD on Gamestop. I will take a look at the biggest institutional inflows and outflows into Gamestop and ~~reason myself into bullish confirmation bias~~ explain why objectively the buyers are right and the sellers are fuk.

You can also see my full DD with charts and images and emojis and shit in this PowerPoint, *yes there is a Powerpoint, DID I STUTTER?:* [*https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk*](https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk)

This DD is concerned with **institutional investments** in Gamestop. Why do we care about institutional investors?

1. They can greatly influence the price with big buy or sell orders
2. They often have longer holding periods than WSB autists. If many institutions hold Gamestop, it reduces the actively traded float and increases the probability of a short squeeze.
3. Institutional buy-in means support for the fundamental value of Gamestop and confidence in their turnaround.

**Tl;dr:** Lots of institutions IMMEDIATELY but quietly made big bets on Gamestop after Ryan Cohen made his first investment. I believe these inflows will continue as his influence on the company grows. While many institutions also exited Gamestop in the past months, due to the timing of their sales I believe these were panic sells that were made prematurely.

***Even more tl;dr:*** **🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦,** but you really might need to hold for quite a few months to see big gains.

This post talks about three different issues:

1. Gamestop’s situation in Summer 2020, and how Ryan Cohen swooped in to save the day.
2. How different institutions reacted to Ryan Cohen’s investment
3. Why the bullish institutions were right, and the bearish ones were wrong

**Part 1: Initial situation in summer of 2020**

Things were looking real dire for Gamestop just a couple of months ago.

[-91&#37; return in 5 years, nice](https://preview.redd.it/ejlho2zamuc61.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3d0686cb7459d56d881f43865474489f5be60b)

The price was on a consistent slide. Sentiment was absolutely terrible. A dying brick and mortar company. Going short was a sure thing. Then, Covid and retail closures. Bear thesis totally confirmed, right? Right?

In swoops Ryan Cohen and sneakily accumulates 5% of the company. We all know what happened to the share price after.

[Look at that erection](https://preview.redd.it/u5i7k2oemuc61.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a99e455105e7cd1d6cd85c12d65afbdb225e6f)

This DD is mainly concerned with institutional money flows in Q3 2020 - who bought and who sold, and what can we conclude from that?

**Part 2: How different institutions reacted in Q3**

Now sadly reporting takes a long time so we only know what movements funds made up until September 30, 2020. But that gives us a glimpse into what funds did in the same quarter in which Ryan Cohen bought in.

In that quarter, institutions ***bought*** 22m shares of Gamestop and ***sold*** 13m. A few big names were involved both in the selling and the buying.

https://preview.redd.it/62lu32fimuc61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=234024c1e51099af1c098c4e556f6b788512e45d

"But drunkiez", you say "why do I care? So some institutions sold and some bought? How does this info help me go to Mars?" Read on my child.

**Part 3: Why the bulls were right**

The relevant info here is ***timing***. If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020, 7 of those opened completely ***new*** positions once they heard about Cohen's first investment. The other 3 increased their share count by ***200-900%!*** They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely - Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer, but had a long-term chance for a new future. These guys are in it for the long haul. Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20-40 quarters. The average WSB tard can't even hold for 20-40 minutes.

[Institutions are loving this turnaround story](https://preview.redd.it/jg1zasbnnuc61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf69d9a1a36ee3c4fbd55ffed3e9447c069d4079)

Now what about the poopoo bears?

We can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020. These funds also have long holding periods. In fact, you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly **unchanged share holdings** since at least September 2019, and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic, right before they heard about Cohen's involvement.

&#x200B;

[The most bearish institutions bagheld for months and panic sold right before our lord came in](https://preview.redd.it/huityktkmuc61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa909d1a28f275276f9987580a769650fc3f684)

Actually, the truth is even worse then the chart shows. Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019. Yes, you read that right. Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018, bagheld for over two years, then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in. Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019, then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom. D.E. Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019, and panic sold at the bottom. They all deserve to be mods on this sub. Do you really want to follow these people with your trades?

What does this mean for the future? Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2020. I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment. Not to speak of Q1 2021, when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members. This turnaround story has only just begun.

**Bonus: why it's a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen**

A lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub. If you want to understand why I'm bullish on anything he does, read this great DD by runningAndJumping22: [GME DD - Background and experience of new leadership](https://www.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/)

I just want to add one point to this: building a successful startup is HARD. Out of the companies that receive funding (which in itself is really hard to do), 9 out of 10 will go on to fail. But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100%? **If you've already done it before**. You have the money, the network and the talent to do it again. Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished: Tesla, Affirm, SpaceX, all of Peter Thiel's successes, Palantir, Youtube, Linkedin, etc. Very different companies, every single one of them a winner.

VC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders, because **they know they will have an almost 100% chance of succeeding again**. Ryan and his buddies have done it once, and they can do it again. It doesn't really matter to us how they do it. They could walk into any fund's office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e-commerce company. But they chose to do it with Gamestop. Not a bad idea in itself.

In my opinion, they could literally close every single store, sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch (btw: Chewy, which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there). But Gamestop does come with some good assets: a store base, a well-known name, partnerships, Reginald Fils Aime on the board, etc.

One hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street. I know this point has been beaten to death lately, but I think it will take **several quarters of Cohen's involvement and operational changes** to truly change that, so you really shouldn't invest a ton of money if you're not willing to hold for that long. However, we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. Even without a short squeeze, this stock can go to the moon in the coming years.

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to lose ground, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, losing over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further decrease in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher & higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction & lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

**Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! Have a great day and see you next time❗**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Drama night Summary (Retarded edition) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I Support you , so i support me _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Collateral value of lending shares GME and getting assignment on call options Hello retards,

First of all i do not want to make anyone afraid but i really think it is important to give a warning on a unlikely thing that could happen.

Today i discover my GME shares (around 4000) are lend out. I like that because i do get 10%+ (broker takes other 10% so shorts are bleeding). But i discover also that the collateral amount for those lending is not higher then 40$ at the moment. If the lender default i would not get more then the 40$ back.   
I am a bit afraid that even the big short players will bring the shorting of GME under a separately entity to protect there main business and being able to be more aggressive. They could default more easy this way and i know it most scummy thing this hedge fund can do it would not surprise me with what they do now and in the past.    


**What should happen? What can we do?**  


1. Check if your broker lend your long GME position if they do without benefit for you stop that.
2. Ask your broker with this circumstances to give more collateral  because there is more risk and swings on this stock. probably there is a "expert" involve who gives the "right" amount of collateral but i have no trust in this "expert" (those experts are not on our side).   


The more collateral they need to put up the better it is for us in anyway possible.

&#x200B;

Extra info : today a get assignment on 21$ ITM call options for 29 January. Some people or MM really need those shares i think. getting those shares now is better then lending for them. (so look out with writing naked far ITM call options)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB - Yolo Update 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 Today's comeback from down 5% was very impressive.  The path forward for any ascendant stock is never a straight line, so any time you get through a red 5%er like that without losing your mind consider it a gift and strengthen your resolve to push forward.

As for me, I am ass deep in contracts, and another 40,000 shares in another account.

Finally a reminder that you are all very special, but BB is on the path back whether or not WSB participates.  100 million share volume days means institutions and funds.

So fucking diamond hands this and LFG.  🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Pre-market looks like it could start red tomorrow as well.  That's okay. Stay the course.

You made us a shitload of tendies, and we are forever grateful. Since SadJim already acknowledged some of us aren’t nearly as autistic as most of us are retarded, I wanted to submit a strategy play that could give $GME more fuel for 🚀 🚀 🚀 

See, most of us retards, especially the other autists over in r/gaming don’t just spend our tendies on condoms for our wives boyfriends — some of us are stupid enough to dump our tendies into dumb bullshit called *in-game transactions*. Typically, these transactions are in the pursuit of digital assets, like different colored 🌈 🐻 jumpers for your retarded characters to wear in the game. In case you autists missed it (I’m sure Daddy Cohen didn’t), I just said digital **assets**. 

Now, a smart man would take a look at this and say: “so fucking what? Who gives a shit about fake digital shit that doesn’t even exist. We like terminals with lots of big numbers, charts that go up, and green”. I’m not going to belabor the irony here.

The fact is we’re not smart men. We’re autists. And when autists see pent up value as a secondary market in gaming accounts, we see fucking tendies.

Of course Daddy Cohen has put two and two together, but I know you retards need a helping hand so here we go. Essentially, along with its increased emphasis on online game sales, $GME could also create a marketplace for gaming accounts whereby customers sell accounts for various games using valuations derived from tools $GME develops on its platform. Some tool/plug-in scans your accounts, determines the current value of your shit, and you can sell it to retards who are too lazy to amass their own dumb digital shit on their own time.

“You stupid fucking retard”, you may be saying. Yes, I know, I know. The gaming companies whom publish the games are technically the owners of those assets! Not the people who actually *paid for them*!

Well listen here motherfuckers. Daddy Cohen just bent Melvin over and fisted him after an aggressive spanking — you think he’s not ready to spend half of those tendies on a rabid team of lawyers to do the same thing to EA or Activision?

The time is now.

2/19 $BB 13.5c 100 x 5_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ how much will it cost for shorts to cover gme? I started asking myself 2 questions recently: 

1-) why hasn't the SEC said anything yet about the current short interest? which leads to my second question

2-) what if there just isn't enough money for shorts to cover their position? maybe that could explain why the SEC have been silent so far... I don't know

 all you beautiful degenerates, I know a lot of you smart people are out there are looking at every little thing on GME so I have to ask this. according to shortsqueeze the last reported short interest was 71million shares; given the current pps of $43.02 how much would it cost if the shorts give up and decide to cover? let's make it easy and assume time froze and the pps doesn't budge a cent while they cover? I did my crude math, **it looks too good to be true and wouldn't want to be in their shoes**

say whatever you will about gme business, the mm deep pockets, all the strings they can pull etc but one thing is for sure is there are still **71millions shares to cover** so pls just share  the math on how much that will cost even if  (hypothetically)  there is no squeeze. That will give everyone a good understanding to everyone how screwed are the shorts

I'd see you on the moon_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next Sector Growth  The stock market is still following the standard business cycle
 
We've moved passed basic materials and capital goods Those sectors will still grow, but at a turtle pace 

 With a democratic government that will print money for economic recovery and accepts the reality of global warming. Any hints of partnership with private energy companies or movement with Biden's environmental plan. With the combination of an essentially one-party government and being on the cusp of moving into the energy sector, we can possibly see technology levels of returns from the lows of March to now. 

 I won't recommend any specific stock(s) because it won't matter much. The entire energy sector, especially renewable energy like electric or solar will actually moon. Don't expect massive returns within a week tho, IMO this play will make a great yield with a somewhat low level of risk. Still do your dd and invest responsibly.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Martin Shkreli on Gamestop Our pharma bro Pill Gates has offered his take on GME. Argue why he's right or wrong in the comments below. I'm a retard so I don't know.

From his post on his subreddit:

>Lots of people interested in $GME - the stock is fairly valued (probably a touch overvalued, really). A big turnaround is priced in. Peak free cash flows were around $300m, so if a new team could do that, perhaps it has some upside, but that is quite the stretch. Would short at $60-80, would buy at $20--congrats to those who bought at $4!

>(from martin posted by mo)

&#x200B;

>I don't really think about short ratio, etc. when looking at stocks. Think about it: what difference does it make? The fact that some shorts may cover \[if it/as it continues to go up\] is counterbalanced fairly evenly by the fact that they all think its overvalued! In my experience, stocks that are crowded shorts or have large borrow rates (or both) are often likely to decline. The question is can one take the pain. Outside of trading dynamics, my simple approach with all of investments is: what would I pay for this entire business. I would not pay $3 billion for a risky turnaround. I think the turnaround will go fine as COVID goes away and they have new management/active stockholders. Typically I really could not care less who owns a stock. All of this stuff is really silly relative to real value. Now, if you care about what price the stock will be this week or next week, perhaps it matters. But to me, I'm worried about buying a $40 stock if I think it is worth $80 or more. That's not this. I'm also interested in shorting a $40 stock if it is worth $20 or so. That's not this either. Like most stocks, it's neither here nor there, thanks to the arbitrage of the market. The smart money was buying in COVID-induced panic for retailers. The arbitrage opportunity appears over to me. Keep in mind the guys who were short at $10 are probably out and replaced by bigger meaner traders who are short at $40. It's not easily to tell who is short or what their basis is FYI/FWIW. Finally, the craziest concept, and i know some of [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) is thinking this, is the idea that one could crowd-source a "short squeeze". A group of people buying a lot of stock, even 10% of it, won't really change the price much without fundamental changes. That's why short squeezes are more mythical than empirical. Usually, short-sellers exit positions because of fundamental changes. It's true SOME short sellers will exit because of price changes, but they'll usually be replaced by traders who are new to the position. For instance, I came to this situation hoping it would be a good short (and open-minded that it would be a good long). I don't think it is. One can't buy their own asset and keeping trying to sustain its price. Eventually the company has to deliver on something.

These ETFs won't stop, can't stop, plus they have low IV at the moment, allowing for some of that more traditional options gambling. If a certain group of space monkeys PowerUp successfully and go full Jupiter AM-18 like Able and Baker, then these should see a decent boost.

**The questions you should be asking...**

People have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.

You're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.

How do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GameStop's been on it far too long.

But brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?

&#x200B;

**Questions for you**

Have you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?

Do you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).

&#x200B;

**General thesis as of today:**

* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us
* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)
* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.
* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)
* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company
* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

&#x200B;

**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**

As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.

These dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.

By looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.

If someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).

Those institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.

Those short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.

With the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.

All of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.

But with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.

# FOR THE NOOBS

&#x200B;

* **ELI5**

GME🚀 bears r fuk

&#x200B;

* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**

I have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.

Days to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.

The catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.

This is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.

I used to post DD and stock picks on here under another name. I may start again soon, I stopped for personal reasons and deleted that account, that was almost 2 years ago.

* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**

Learn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron

How I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.

After that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.

Do it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.

&#x200B;

***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.

Fuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.

This isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.

**The mania around here now has the public viewing us as some goddamn conglomerate pump and dump scheme. That shit has to stop. We're just dudes with small accounts compared to the real big fish, and we believe in $GME.**

I'm not going to lie, I got a little worried when I saw that 3 people on executive team -- the head of Enterprise Software, the CMO and CFO -- sold large %'s of their stock holdings on Wednesday (the disclosures are filed on a 1 day lag, so we don't know if more people sold on Thursday).

&#x200B;

It wasn't the $ amount that worried me as much as it was how much of their holdings they sold. Like if John Chen sold 5% or even 10% of his stock tomorrow, I wouldn't blame him or think anything of it. He's probably got his whole net worth tied up in the stock, can't blame a brotha for taking some $ off the table to de-risk your life. But the CMO's sold 60% of his shares (at $12.63), and the **CFO literally sold 100% of his shares** (at $13.01).

And looking at the filing, it doesnt look like this was part of preset sale plan that he just unluckily turned on before the stock went up. I looked at his last stock sale in October, and the footnotes are pretty explicit. So he genuinely just looked at the price on the screen and by his own free will decided to sell every share he owned as soon as the stock hit $13.

Ignore for a moment the fact that he's been CFO for 7 years and owns fewer shares than at least 10% of the autists on here (wtf). **More importantly, if his stake is so low that it's clearly not a big % of his net worth, why sell literally every share he owns instead of riding them to the moon?** You'd think that guy would have been like "thank god people finally see the value we know is coming, now would be the best time for me to **BUY** shares since I own so few right now, and that'll help this thing moon even faster!"

And since these don't get filed for a day or two, we don't know if other people also sold yesterday. But if it turns out the guy running QNX also sold 1/2 his shares, that's going to be even worse.

Am I just being paranoid and reading too much into this? It's sad to say but unfortunately I can't just walk off losing 20% of my life savings like some of the other autists on here, like that would really suck.  Real talk, does this give anyone else pause for concern?

**EDIT:** some people saying in comments that this was a pre-arranged sale. First, I don't think that's correct. It looks pretty clear that when it is tied to a pre-arranged plan, the filing explicitly says so. (also who does a pre-arranged sale for 100% of their stock in one transaction?)Also, I just googled it, and apparently if it was a pre-arranged plan, it wouldn't have said the note that says the sales were done in multiple transactions at different prices, because if it's pre-arranged, the sale would've happened automatically wherever stock opened that day (hence why the GME example just has one transaction / one price). So the fact that it was multiple transactions means he pulled the trigger himself in the middle of the day.

Easiest to see when you compare to what it looks like for a pre-arranged sale. Look at this example from GME: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315015/000132638015000218/xslF345X03/wf-form4a\_144555581244023.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315015/000132638015000218/xslF345X03/wf-form4a_144555581244023.xml)

Second point raised was that that's not 100% of his stock since it doesn't include RSU's or new shares he'd receive in December. But if you look at his earlier sales this year (which were much smaller), the filings says if he has RSU's, as well as if the sale was just related to selling shares that vested. If the last shares vested on 9/30/20, I don't think the next tranche would've vested on Jan 22nd, they would've already vested on 12/31/20.

I noticed my margin went down 23k and my maintenance requirement increased 23k. I called my broker and asked why and they said that GME has an "increased risk" and therefore they are now requiring all shareholders and shortsellers to have a minimum 70% maintenance requirement. Any thoughts and/or anyone else seeing this with their brokers_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME DD: Float breakdown + MOASS speculations  This is a somewhat long read. Let’s start with the summary.

# Tldr;

* VW-like MOASS is likely to happen regardless of whether we 💎hand or not; and whether we keep stocks in cash vs margin. Pussy 🧻🖐are not going to make the squeeze any weaker but rather they will just miss out on the best part.
* The true float is not enough to cover all shorts. (not new, but detailed holding breakdown below)
* The most violent part of the squeeze is likely to happen on the last 1-2 days of the squeeze, not the beginning. 
* The end (peak) of the squeeze is not in our hands as much as it is in the hands of large institutional holders, insiders or a company offering.
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Disclaimer**: I’m a simple retard trying to understand the mechanics of the market. This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.

# Float deep dive

Previous DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. 

I wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.

## True float 

Before looking at the data, let’s talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.

As mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.

Thus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short

= share float + short interest = \~117M

Now, let’s take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I’ve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn’t account for WSB holdings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gg7lm3zj1uc61.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c77a8a0b8e8cecef2ad754a04029d302fc52e3

 

## Observations

* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. 
   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. 
   * This is what previous DD’s referred to as negative float.
*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1

# Why I don’t think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference

The premise from previous DD’s is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. 

Essentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the “true float”  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.

Eventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a 💎hand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.

Thus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account 💎hand shares.

When the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.

While I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don’t think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:

1. Shorters don’t have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. 
2. I’d expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.
3. It’s obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.
4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it’s squeeze sounds like suicide so I’m speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.

In other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you’re considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.

# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW

The short:float ratio is not constant.

Since insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.

As shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.

To imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.

Since it’s hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:

* Let’s assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.
   * This probably isn’t very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.
   * If anything, I’d imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.
* Let’s assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze
   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.
   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.
   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.
* Let’s assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze
   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. 
   * Even if someone is that crazy, I’d expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.

Following the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.

To visualize the data above, let’s put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&format=png&auto=webp&s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05

&#x200B;

 

Observations

1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.
   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.
2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.
3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.

Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.

I’m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it’s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don’t see why they wouldn’t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.

My conclusion - 

The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.

Positions: \~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.

If you search for "Carbon Capture" in the statement (and if you retards could read) you will see how they are actually contributing to the effort and plan on focusing on this market as one of their niches within green energy as a whole. With Daddy Elon tweeting this could this be a sign of an upcoming rise in the value of $ENG?

Also adding this just for valuation and true potential, we see how they are trading at a lower multiple than the bigger guys like FCEL and PLUG [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsT3YLLVoAMp781?format=jpg&name=large). This gives ENG more upside to grow 20x to match the levels of FCEL and PLUG, which would be a stock price of $140. That sounds outrageous and I'd aim for a lower target of around $20 for the short term until we really see traction and news on the company pick up.

The market however was open when this happened and I’m guessing it cost a lot of folks billions because others bought due to seeing information that was not supposed to be public.

- At a loss of 24,000,000.00 to 40,600,000.00 per dollar increase in interest for a day in short positions all shorts are bleeding money

- 95k shares available for shorting down from 1.2 million means the shorts can't seasaw, based on IKBR

- more media outlets are showing positive news for GME so more people are jumping in than before

- at spot price it would cost 3.2 billion to cover all shorts


My thoughts
With current estimations of 6 days to cover the short interest when a short squeeze takes off i dont see hedge funds covering this without being margin called; they've all found religion and are praying for a hard market correction to cover and exit. I'm pretty sure alot of them are going to have to liquidate most or all holdings to cover if margin called.

That being said I expect this stock take off now on the basis that short selling doesn't work, they were seasawing 1.2 million to try to push the price down, and they've maxed out. This stock is not going back down unless a catastrophe happens and even so the stock might be suppressed for a day if that due to the limited shares moving around.

Expect huge volatility with an only upwards trajectory due to 💎 ✋ s. 

I'm hoping for a margin call myself and to be blunt I'm going to try to sell my shares at a million a piece.


The size of the short interest and limited supply of shares in circulation leads me to believe that estimates that this is only going to 5x or 10x is way off. VW short interest was 12.8% and GME is over 100%. Hedge funds lost $30 billion covering just 12.8%. What do you think 100% covering with an estimated 6 days to cover based on stock circulation will look like.

This is going to make head lines when the short squeeze starts snowballing. And I honestly believe its now that it starts. Theres no downward pressure.

Once the world transitions to fully renewable energy, large batteries are going to be a must have. According to what I’ve read, vanadium batteries are much better than alternatives. They have higher cycles with less deterioration, and they are cheaper when used at scale. 
This is all just from what I’ve read online, so I’m unsure whether or not to trust it fully. I have a very basic understanding of battery technology and am not confident enough to say these claims are true or not. I was hoping someone in this community could give some more insight or knowledge on the topic. 

With Tesla’s obvious path towards energy storage with power walls and other products, is there a chance Tesla will use vanadium batteries? 

Are vanadium batteries actually better than alternatives at a larger scale? Will they be the battery of choice for these future fully electric grids? How can we capitalize on this if these claims are true? 

If anyone has any knowledge on the topic please contribute to the conversation. 

I know everyone here is retarded but I’m sure some of you actually know what you’re talking about, my apologies for bad formatting as this is my first post._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citron is starting to look a lot less like a "research company" and a lot more like just some guy tweeting from his apartment. How does a company not know that the *fucking presidential inauguration* is happening? Putting that aside, the stream does eventually go live aaaaand... it's just some guy ranting? Was it recorded on his phone?

Is Citron an actual thing? Is there a brick and mortar office building, with revenues and services, or is it literally just *some guy* making tweets with a lemon picture? I'm so confused right now.

And why aren't they bullish on $LMND? What's the point of manipulating the market if you aren't going to make memes or inside jokes? Gourd, what a waste._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
