 CRSR: A magic crayon story  https://imgur.com/9AI9FCa 

Okay autists, if you aren't balls deep in some CRSR plays, then pull up a fucking chair.  Because your about to see some magic on why we are going on a non-stop RGB ride to the fucking moon.  Feast your eyes on that last candle.  Looks pretty fucking brutal.  Nasty day of selling that's been the norm for CRSR since before Christmas.

But what else do you see?  Cause to my eyes I see a mother fucking hammer candle ready to slap those paper hands pussies the fuck out of the way before the ride to tendy town.  This has been the 3rd time we've tested the 38% Fib retracement from our original parabolic run (yellow arrows). This is what we like to call a triple fucking bottom.  And not the kind you perform for your gf/wife's boyfriend. Not only that, this was a test of the support line that CRSR has followed since the IPO back in September.  A test that bulls clearly passed as evidenced by that beautiful dangling dick just swinging below that candle.

Hammer candle, triple bottom, holding support?  You couldn't ask for a more gift wrapped sign to buy the mother fucking dip. This bitch is about to start a run back up in anticipation of another great earnings report.  I'm fully expecting us to be $45 by the end of Jan ready and waiting for earnings to catapult us to ATH and a run to the $58-$65 level. Load the fuck up 2/19 options or shares if you want to go the boomer route.

TL:DR - BTFD on CRSR, shit's going to moon according to voodoo crayons.

Positions: 1500 shares and shorting the fuck out of 2/19 40P

\*Edit\* Chart wasn't fucking working_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why BNGO will be your bingo ticket to the üöÄ Bionano Geonomics (BNGO)


Let‚Äôs start with cathie wood at Ark. She has already stated that genomics will be the future in terms of tech development. ARKG is heavily invested into PACB which is BNGO‚Äôs competitor. 

BNGO recently released that their product Saphyr is now 30%ish more efficient than PACB‚Äôs product.

PACB‚Äôs market cap is 4.9B

BNGO current market cap as of this writing trading at 6.58 which leaves them at 1B market cap.

Assume similar price trajectory to PACB‚Äôs market puts this at 4.9x of its current share valuation. Which puts this around $32.00/share!!

BNGO is waiting on FDA approval right now which could be further catalyst and reason for Cathie to enter. 

BNGO got an extension of nasdaq delisting by 6months a few weeks ago which at this point no longer matters. (This means BNGO needs to trade above $1.00 consistently for 10 trading days to meet compliance) 

I recommend buying now. Load up. Anywhere between 2-5 is sexy. I expect a small dip

My current positions: 500shares averaged at 2.73$/share

My strategy is to sell a quarter of my position at $10 and let the rest ride long term. If this dips anywhere below 3 again, I am adding more to my shares

First DD so do your own research! Tbh, I‚Äôve never felt more confident about this. 

EDIT 1: This is posted after the run up to fit the market cap requirement of 1B that this sub requires prior to posting or auto removal. 

EDIT 2: I am being told in the comments that PACB is actually complimentary to BNGO's technology. This makes me even more bullish & likely that Cathy would invest in this game changing tech. 

EDIT 3: A team member from ARKG (Cathie's fund for Genomics investing) has already contacted BNGO via Twitter. 

EDIT 4: Previous TESLA EXEC (Christopher Stewart) joined BNGO as CFO - news reported Aug 2020

TLDR: buy BNGO before you miss the boat.

To the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Great Leap Ideas for 2021 - BTFD Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections. But fear not and BTFD. Here're some top picks:  


1. NIO. Just released its December 2020 delivery numbers yesterday, and as expected, they killed it. 121% increase in deliveries for 2020. Deliveries doubled year-over-year. There are also rumors that Nio will open its first non-Chinese store in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's comfortably over $50 today. I predict $60+ by Nio Day. Furthermore, I predict over $100 by eoy. Anything below $45 looks good rn. Weeklies might be worth it, but to be safe, go for leaps.   

2. JMIA. This is the African Alibaba-Amazon. I'm being a touch anecdotal, but I bought BABA when it was $60/share, and while waiting for its meteoric rise, BABA received the same criticism 12 years ago that JMIA is getting now (\[China's\] infrastructure is weak! They're not tech-savvy! They're not revenue positive!), I also see parallel upsides: JMIA knows its customers. It services over 12 countries and has a customer base of 1.2-Billion people. That's more customers than what Alibaba has in China. Furthermore, JMIA's platform has a payment system like Alipay, a food delivery service like DoorDash, and a travel booking service like Expedia all bundled in one platform that happens to also be one of the most popular websites/mobile apps in Africa.   
JMIA will monopolize many industries in the large and rapidly growing continent of Africa. MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are some of their investors. The two co-ceo's (Europeans) formerly worked at McKinsey, and their African co-founder is a Harvard MBA alum and successful entrepreneur. Fun fact: Alibaba outcompeted Ebay in China and became the de facto local E-commerce provider. Similarly, JMIA out-competed Amazon and Alibaba to be the most popular platform in Africa.    

3. PLTR. The stock price will suck for a couple of months, but hear me out. Compared to its share price, the covered call premiums are juicy. I have 1000 shares and make around 300 - 700 a week from holding them. I don't mind holding for the long term because of the enormous upside. Most of PLTR's current clients are government groups like the US Military, the FBI, and the Greek Government, but they plan to increasingly expand their services to private companies under the "Foundry" Platform, which is projected to have a market size of $56B. According to the PLTR website, Foundry will serve "approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500-million in annual revenue". It's no wonder CEO Alex Karp said investors will be "pleasantly surprised." It might dip below 20 near-term, but hold for the long-term tendies. 

Again, the above three stocks will likely suffer from the GA Senate runoff election's volatility, but these are opportunities to load up on more shares and/or buy leaps. We're still in a Fed-fueled secular bull market. A republican senate would be favorable for stocks, but I think NIO and PLTR in particular will have an overall favorable increase under a blue wave, while JMIA is just too similar to Alibaba to ignore right now. They are one earnings-beat away from mooning.

As always, do you own DD, and Happy 2021!   


Let's make tendies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BNGO - can post now since it‚Äôs over 1B valuation _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QRTEA (yes, QVC) DD ‚Äî A deep dive on the bull case for a solid value play Sit down and listen up ladies and gentlecucks, I have some fresh-off-the-griddle DD for you.

Let‚Äôs talk about QRTEA aka Qurate Retail Group aka QVC aka QxH. I‚Äôve noticed nobody on here is really talking about this company but it‚Äôs in a very interesting position and is way undervalued.

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way:

‚ÄúYou mean the fucking company that sells shit to my boomer parents on TV?‚Äù

Yeah, *that* fucking company.

[OMFG it‚Äôs not a Robinhood chart](https://preview.redd.it/xc2dg3n35e961.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=750d9e9a7a59ceeed81d49fd772e3887fe1ecbef)

[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)

Real quick, let‚Äôs first take a look at WTF I‚Äôm talking about. You see that sad, sad 5 year chart above? Great.

**1. QVC:** ***that*** **boomer fuck of a company? And WTF is a Qurate?**

Okay so I can‚Äôt answer that second question. Is it supposed to be a play on ‚Äòcurate‚Äô? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs fucking awful‚Äîbut irrelevant. Moving on.

Over the past 5 years QVC has gone down the shitter. Which, well, duh‚Äîwho the fuck besides your granny is buying stuff from a TV channel? The price bottomed out around $3 earlier this year. Oof.

But through a series of buyouts, mergers, and restructures between 2018 and today, they‚Äôve strategically and, frankly, very quietly put themselves in a **great** position to make a significant turnaround. I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks so‚Äîyou‚Äôll see why below.

First and foremost, here‚Äôs the deal: their market cap is currently only $4.9B, which makes no sense against their revenues, which were roughly $13.5B in 2019. **That‚Äôs a P/S ratio of only \~0.35** aka THEIR MARKET CAP IS ONLY A THIRD OF THEIR REVENUES. The fuck.

[lol charts](https://preview.redd.it/mynaofv45e961.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c633025c0f000d9f6c0a9fff95098b3a7305490)

[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)

In 2018 they increased their revenues dramatically YoY. But you‚Äôre probably thinking **so fucking what? I have eyes and can see in 2019 they had a shit year** and did the opposite of grow. Well‚Ä¶

**2. OMNICHANNEL. No but, actually, ecommerce.**

So first and foremost: In 2018, **ecommerce revenue became 58% of their annual revenues \[1\].** So they‚Äôre no longer just ‚Äúthat tv channel your senile grandma buys from‚Äù. **They‚Äôre a through-and-through ecomm company now.**

To go further, they actually own several ecommerce brands including Zulily. Y‚Äôall‚Äôve likely seen ads for Zulily but I‚Äôm sure most of you have no idea what they sell. That‚Äôs because the target demo isn‚Äôt you, it‚Äôs mothers with young children, aka woman between the ages of 20 and 40. My guess is that that represents a few of you but the vast majority of you are basement-dwelling manchildren that would never use Zulily. I certainly don‚Äôt. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter **what** they sell‚Ä¶

My point is that in 2018 they grew their customer base by 24% \[2\] and in 2019 they released a stat noting that they have **91% customer return rate \[3\]** which is insanely high with that growth. Their customers are dedicated af and their customer base is growing rapidly.

What sort of P/S ratios do ecomm companies have in 2020? Well, let‚Äôs look at the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù case, Overstock:

https://preview.redd.it/jiesgqa65e961.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f4c46af4728b51cb86e2e2d64949f8c857b1eb

Over 2x higher than Qurate.

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs just one company. What about others?‚Äù

[thanks ycharts](https://preview.redd.it/60obqo275e961.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb073198e793423bd2693b8b1fb8323c7c362c60)

Convinced yet? No? Fucking fine, let‚Äôs keep going.

**3. Ferrari? No, Ferraro. (And maybe a Ferrari)**

Their shitty 2019 revenues were likely due to a massive restructuring where they finally merged HSN and QVC at the end of 2018 \[4\]. No surprise there, restructuring two behemoth old fucks is a big job. Money was invested. Revenues slid.

**But then at the end of 2019, they hired Leslie Ferraro \[5\].** Who the fuck is Ferraro? Oh, only the previous president of Disney‚Äôs Consumer Products division during one of their highest growth periods \[6\] and someone who was at the company for 17 years before leaving in 2016. This is a woman who has options, she‚Äôs not going to join a sinking ship after taking 3 years to make a decision about what company to join.

So she joined in September 2019, just before we kicked off our current pandemic, as president of newly-combined QxH, which is the combination of QVC and HSN (oh look, they have no real competitors in this space now). With her experience in marketing, licensing, and interactive media, she‚Äôll likely be able to grow the digital and ecomm side of this business beyond its life as fading boomer TV telesales networks.

Even so, their revenues were still surprisingly significant which brings me to 2020‚Ä¶

**4. COVID-19**

When COVID-19 happened and we all got trapped inside and forgot what it was like to interact with other humans, like when you used to leave your basement to say hi to your wife and her boyfriend upstairs. This means your boomer parents and granny have been doing nothing but watching fucking TV and browsing the internet at 300% zoom. I don‚Äôt think I need to tell you why that‚Äôs good for QRTEA but just in case you‚Äôre too smooth-brained to understand: it means they‚Äôve done incredibly well this year compared to 2019 and will likely outdo their 2018 revenues.

Just take a look at their last 10-Q filing: [https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets\_260982](https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets_260982) (big numbers, many words. TL;DR, numbers go from negative in 2019 to positive in 2020)

**5. Michael-fucking-Burry**

In addition to all of this, there‚Äôs my favorite kicker: sometime between June and September, Michael Always-A-Bit-Too-Early-But-Not-Wrong Burry bought **1.1 million shares** of QRTEA \[7\]. Since then the price has just bounced around a bunch and is still flat, but that doesn‚Äôt mean squat. This is a man with a plan and a fuckton of shares.

**6. The Dividends**

On November 20th, Qurate released an announcement that they‚Äôll be doing a $1.50 per share special dividend, and a share buyback \[8\]. Presumably, this means they‚Äôve been having a spectacular Q4, on top of a great three quarters leading up to that, and they have the cash to not only give a dividend but buy back shares.

https://preview.redd.it/fbandwh85e961.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48e4a8beb54cce18c18a682077d057c1bd3efb2

The day they made that announcement, the price jumped from $8.83 to $11.59 by the 25th. It settled in the $10 range after that.

**7. Lastly, Melvin Capital, those dumb fucks, and the battle of shorts**

I swear, it‚Äôs like they exclusively just inverse Burry‚Äôs positions. Or Burry inverses their positions? IDGAF. The point is‚Ä¶

Melvin Capital is holding $31M of puts \[9\] on QRTEA. They created this position in Q2 of this year \[10\] when the stock was between $5-7, so I assume they expected Qurate to go bankrupt (lol) and have put themselves in a really shitty position. They actually unraveled about $11M worth of puts in Q3, so that $31M position is down from $42M, I guess realizing they were immediately underwater and, perhaps, becoming aware of Burry‚Äôs investment.

As we all know, these folks will do anything to keep the price down. They‚Äôre already underwater and I‚Äôve noticed the past couple weeks there has been a whale putting up a huge sell wall to keep the price below $11.30. Keep playing those games, friends. How‚Äôs it working out for you on GME?

**8. Conclusion**

So where does this leave us? We have a company that has a wildly undervalued market cap compared to revenues, has restructured itself into a real ecomm company, has brought on an expert at growth in the interactive and licensing space, has growing revenue during a pandemic and was perfectly positioned to take advantage of it and feed growth, and is doing so well it issued a special dividend and set up a buyback program. Michal MF Burry has bought in, and Melvin Capital is shorting it‚Äîwhich if GME is anything to go by, is a good sign.

**TL;DR: QRTEA is no longer a boomer company and the market hasn‚Äôt realized it yet so it‚Äôs still undervalued. Q4 holiday earnings are in February üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

**Position: 2300 shares, 500 $18.5c 4/16**

\[edit2\] Added direct image links_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NOTHING IS BEYOND REACH OF OUR AUTISM _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB vs Shorters (GME) SEC should get involved in potential price manipulation Post after post I have been reading about various data that indicates some type of stock price manipulation regarding short-sellers and the GME stock. I want this post to act as a place where we can discuss the legitimacy of these claims and what concrete steps we could take to make sure this potentially illegal activity is reported 

Personally the best idea I‚Äôve read is to contact the SEC and to use as much information as possible to try and make a case for stock price manipulation. Link to SEC site where reports are filed: https://www.sec.gov/tcr

This post is mainly to organize these discussions and to form a master template which we can potentially mass send to the SEC to hopefully make sure this type of illegal activity doesn‚Äôt happen again if it is happening in this situation. 

Disclaimer: Don‚Äôt file any reports without evidence, this is exactly why I created this post and didn‚Äôt file a report myself. We need to make sure the evidence is there, and then we can build a case 

Short version: lets see if the GME stock is being manipulated and organize the discussion and evidence on this post so we can build a case if there is one to be made!

With the creation of 0 commission trading, have any of you done it with spy? Do you find it overly annoying/difficult? Seems straightforward enough but wanted to get your thoughts. Thanks.

Edit: I know this strategy outperforms the market substantially, as (I'm pretty sure) it has held true to outperform buy and hold since spy's inception. Want to focus discussion around:

A) does any of you artists presently do it?

B) the logistics of doing it (do you create a seperate account, do you add to it through the year or keep it as a seperate fund, is it annoying as fuck, etc)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An Idiots watchlist for 2021 I have paper hands but the right picks. I started trading last April and after a year of trading I don‚Äôt have much to show for it. My friends who took my advice do.

I could go on and on about all the stocks I was watching at the right time but didn‚Äôt have the capital to enact on opportunity.

It‚Äôd be more constructive for me to just share my most recent obsessions so a week after I sell for a loss or low(blue)ball my limit order many of you can reap the rewards of my labor. 

LUMN
 
Why: it‚Äôs undervalued and a forgotten stock. Many people hate century link. It‚Äôs dirt cheap. Company may be in the process of restructuring so options may be fucky but that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if monitored correctly. Their internal rate of return is impressive and they‚Äôve been refinancing their loans with the rates that covid made possible. Many bumps in the brains of their financial team. After they clear up some more debt their on the fast track to being investment grade again. Undervalued in many aspects. The advent of 5g will put this company on the map again.

My positions: LUMN 10C2/5 

I feel like that‚Äôs enough exposure, they beat earnings consistently this year and leadership has made it clear on the company is going to pursue profitability. They recently dropped because they did not receive a contract for rural internet. A scarcely profitable endeavor. Has AMD vibes with focusing on profitable aspects of the industry

INGR

The world is addicted to sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Coke is a long term stock MCD is a long term stock. PEP is a long term stock. Their success relies on consistency so they‚Äôre not likely to change their recipe to success. And that recipe involves INGR. Their sales were down because restaurants have been closed so there hasn‚Äôt been as much demand for syrup. Another aspect is that the company recently made an arguably pricey acquisition but with the return to normalcy, or the new definition of it at least that demand will go back up. 

My positions: NONE

I will be paying attention to this one in the spring since their earnings are likely to be lackluster until patron capacities return to normal for their customers (other than the big ticket ones, Lowkey check out their customer list it‚Äôs pretty impressive)

PFE 

I got fucked with this one but I refuse to paper hands. They sit at what they sat at a year ago but it‚Äôs very public they they‚Äôre expecting an increase in revenue of 20 Billion. ‚ÄúBut PFE is too big it won‚Äôt make a dent‚Äù You tell me how a 50% increase in revenue warrants this recent price drop. If JNJ gets fucked with their vaccine later this month it will rise. If JNJ doesn‚Äôt then they already have their customers. When their earnings come out they will rise. The only argument against that is that there‚Äôs too much uncertainty in the situation regarding how often people will need the vaccine. Either way old company that like many of my picks got shat on too much for being a BOOMER. 

My positions: 37.5C2/5 

This should cover both the potential catalysts and I might add to the position if it goes any lower. Yeah insiders sold. Insiders sold months ago before their approval was cemented. Just because insiders don‚Äôt want to trade speculation doesn‚Äôt mean they know the future of the virus or of competitors

DIS

Don‚Äôt fuck with the mouse. Even zoom can‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt screen share Disney+. I was part of a zoom movie party were people subscribed to Disney+ because of this discovery. I‚Äôm willing to bet their next earnings are going to be stellar as a result. 
My positions: None
Am broke boi 

MRK 

Back on my bullshit with this one. I wasn‚Äôt in it for covid vaccine reasons. I like this company because they‚Äôre been working on curing HIV for a very long time and I believe they have 4 potential candidates. They may fail this year and soon but when they get any sort of positive results they will see upside. There‚Äôs doubt in management but their core business will be back with the passing of covid, not to mention keytruda has already proven to be effective for cancer. I expect a similar level of quality with anything MRK puts out.
My positions: NONE 
Don‚Äôt make me say it again. 


SPCE
I will be watching this because of the possibility of Branson flying. As a physics major the whole concept of this company is absurd. Less than 5% of the flight time would be ‚Äúin space‚Äù but I can‚Äôt wait to ride the hype on this baby again. Long term anyone with early exposure to the space industry is likely to claim early exposure to space mining. I have my eyes set long term (as in when I get graduate I‚Äôm going to use a fat portion to buy and hold shares)
My Positions: None 
I sold at $35 because Im not smooth brain. Again waiting for some news from the company/ upper-mid teens. Whichever comes first. Arguably $24 might be near the fair value so I don‚Äôt doubt it can run again.

Bears come fuck and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong. You‚Äôve saved me with SPCE and INTC before so I don‚Äôt doubt that someone can come up with a valid argument against these companies.

 If anyone wants to give any advice on how I can improve as a trader/ has any book recommendation it would be greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I wish I knew earlier buying calls was the answer ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some DD that will actually make you people money. $BPY merger arbitrage  $BAM made a bid to buy $BPY for 16.50 per share today.

&#x200B;

BAM is the parent company to BPY/ they own 60% of outstanding shares.

BAM is also managing BPY, therefore, they had to put an "independent board" in place to evaluate the deal.

Shares are trading hands at 17$ a pop right now, people are betting that they'll have to increase their bid above 16.50.

The June calls have juicy premiums and minimal downside risk as they're striking lower than the bid price. 

The June 2020 16$ puts have been trading hands for 1.15-25$ all day.

Basically, you can sell 16$ puts, locking in the premium and simply wait for the deal vote to go through. With maximum margin, this is a 40% annual return with fairly low risk.

&#x200B;

My position: Sold 200x june 18/2021 puts at an average of 1.20$

During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.

* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.

* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. 

*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.

* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.

*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in "disrupting" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.

*  In more "I thought this is America" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was "Do No Evil."). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.

*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being "missed" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record "growth" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these "growth" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively "responsible" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a "low price" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!

This stock is currently shorted at around 70 percent and with earnings coming up on Jan 7 pre market the stock can easily move up quickly.

This stock is shorted by none other than Melvin capital and they are balls deep in it.

On 11/9/2019 BBBY got there new lord and savior  Mark Tritton . Mark Tritton was the  chief merchandising officer  at target that created strong private labels and helped in the turnaround of target. BBBY has a poor private label collection prior to him joining. Tritton then cleaned house and fired 7 executives and replaced them with people with strong expertise over the course of 2020.  The boomer board was also changed.

Mark did a lot of positive changes he sold  PersonalizationMall.com  for 252 million then went on and sold all the non core assests of BBBY like  one kings lane, christmas tree shops and distribution center for 250 million.   These non core assests were a big drag on operating expense and generating loss so this is a huge positive.

BBBY plans to close around 250 stores over the next two years. The retailer expects to generate up to $350 million in annualized savings from the store closures; lower supply chain costs; selling, general and administrative cost optimization; and more efficient pricing and promotions

BBBY also laid off 5 percent of it workforce on August 2020 to save another $100 million dollar in costs.

The retailer posts a 6% year-over-year comps increase ‚Äî the first sales growth in that measure since 2016.

As u/Daurs points out in his dd there omni channel is already in full swing. They have reported 89% increase in digital sales and they also signed instant delivery and two day delivery with  Shipt and Instacart, for its Bed Bath & Beyond and BuyBuy Baby stores. ([Link to His Original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km048x/very_bullish_on_bbby_dd_included/))

They have an 825 million share buy back out of which 300 million will be spend before March of this year.

With positive earnings, high short interest and share buy back this will moon soon.

Possible catalysts:

1. Dems win both GA seats and the MORE act which already passed the house passes the senate and decriminalizes cannabis in the next few months.
2. Biden deschedules cannabis by executive order like Kamala Harris said he would in the VP debate.
3. Dems take the senate in 2022 paving the way to decriminalize.
4. Republicans listen to the 70% of Americans who want to decriminalize and vote for it.

I know $MJ is only Canadian companies but if the US decriminalizes there will be some partnerships/mergers with MSOs and I'd expect $MJ to add some American companies to their holdings once they're allowed to list on the NYSE/NASDAQ. I also believe this is a winning play even if the US doesn't decriminalize.

But somehow you idiots can be so right, yet so wrong a the same time. But have no fear, I created this account just to save you, because, well idk why but I thought you guys didnt deserve the misery of being wrong yet again.

APHA, ACB, and CGC are NOT the way. These stocks peaked years ago when Canada legalized weed. US legalization means US weed stocks üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ aka GTBIF and CURLF

The primary reasons the US is legalizing weed is for monetary and economic reasons (taxes and jobs for the people on the short bus). The US is not going to go through the trouble of legalizing weed, just import Canadian weed and allow them to capitalize on the economics of it. US will prop up their own production, and tariff any Canadian imports to hell. I would be surprised if a single dime bag of Canadian weed ever gets imported to the US, why would it? Weed is easy to grow and the US is more than capable of it meeting the demand.

If you need more convincing, Curaleaf did 200+ million in revenue LAST QUARTER and Greenthumb did \~160+ million and both companies are profitable already.

The problem is that you cannot buy US weed operators (GTIFB and CURLF) on Robinhood because they trade OTC on lesser known Canadian exchanges. Cant buy them on Merrill Edge either so cant blame Robinhood for everything. But, Fidelity does, so go make a Fidelity and YOLO into the real US weed winners and thank me in two years.

IF you need even more convincing, the first domino to fall in legalization will be allowing US operators to list on major exchanges like NYSE but by then itll be too late for the retail investor.

China to allow ferrous scrap imports from Jan 1
China will allow imports of recycled steel raw materials from Jan. 1, 2021, ending its two-year ban on ferrous scrap imports, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced Dec. 31.

The change will help to regulate and promote the high quality development of the country‚Äôs steel industry, the ministry said.

China's allowance of imports comes after a two-year absence from the seaborne market, after the country introduced restrictions from Dec. 31, 2018.

Imports must conform to the standards of the country‚Äôs recycled iron and steel raw materials specifications (GB/T39733-2020). The customs HS codes that will be allowed allowed are: 7204100010, 7201210010, 7204290010, and 7204490030.

The highly anticipated opening drew a predictably mixed response from the market, with buyers noting that it could drive up prices in the seaborne market that are already at multi-year highs, while sellers were positive about the prospect of increased overall demand for the raw material.

BIG NEWS: üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
 
January US ferrous scrap prices poised for another big jump
US market participants are expecting another big jump in scrap prices once January buying kicks off following the New Year's Day holiday.

Strong mill demand and an export market that has seen prices rise over nine-year highs have predictions for January increases over December prices ranging $60-$100/lt.

"Looks like this thing is going to be a barn burner again," said one supplier. "[Mills] have got all kinds of room to raise prices all they want is scrap delivered quickly," said another.

"We like the scrap market right now. We don't hear anybody holding back at all saying we aren't going to buy, so everybody's going to get in," said a Midwest supplier regarding the demand outlook for the January buy.

Another Midwest supplier believed mills would begin to push back on the increases during the January buy. "I think January is going to be a muted market. I think mills will fight the upside and they'll win," he said, adding that he still believed up $60-$80/lt would end up being the move. "I think there's enough scrap out there but exports have gone up over $100 through the course of the month so it's not like they can go sideways."

"I think dealers are pretty happy with this market. There's got to be some fundamentals supporting something, because these are some pretty good jumps," said a more optimistic Midwest broker. "The sky's the limit and I don't think January's going to do the job. We're gonna start seeing late 2007 and 2008 [prices], I think is where we're headed. Scrap is following [HRC] pretty heavily. It's an extraordinary marketplace for sure."

With January having only 20 business days, many expect mills to enter the market to buy scrap early the week of Jan 4.

Scrap = Schnitzer - look at 2008 stock price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 36k>25k lost more than 13k in three weeks. Need some opinions if I should keep holding these positions. For all of these I have done research so don‚Äôt know where I went wrong. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Thoughts on Why Ryan Cohen Wants GameStop üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ As you all know Ryan Cohen owns a whopping 13% stake(probably more by now) in a "dying/brick-and-mortar/blockbuster" GameStop. 

Let's be honest, when was the last time you've been to GameStop to buy games? Most games are now online, ready to be played with just a touch of a button. However, I think Ryan sees an opportunity even in these troubled times for this physical retail company. 

Before we even start guessing what Ryan is gonna do, we need to know what he has done that made him a billionaire.

Namely, Chewy. Chewy was successful because of three things.

1. He was how fragmented the pet food industry was.
2. He was able to build an understanding relationship with Chewy's customers
3. Top-of-the-line customer service

There are more points obviously but I know you retards all have short attention span so I'm going to keep it as short as possible. So if you look at those three points you should already be making connections with the gaming industry.

1. Gaming industry is as fragmented as it could be. (Amazon,walmart, Bestbuy, target, etc. or EA play, ubisoft plus, PSN plus, etc.)
2. The stores mentioned above are not "gaming-oriented" stores.
3. Gamer specific customer service is almost non-existent or it's not really a thing.

I believe Ryan saw this opportunity because it closely resembles his first company model. I'm not 100% sure what he'd do going forward but the gaming industry is booming right now because of covid and with the new consoles coming out now. This is probably the best time to snatch on this opportunity and tap into unlimited potential of gaining millions of gamers in US. 

I'd be excited to see a gaming platform on either computer or on consoles that unites all games under a single platform with a monthly subscription that is unbeatable compared to other services. 

Sure it'll take months if not years but if this is the way that GameStop is going, I'd feel pretty safe with my positions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fuck whoever was talking about CHWY saying it couldn‚Äôt go tits up. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Canoo/GOEV yolo Yolo: https://i.imgur.com/y8zvFGt.png

$127,500 cost basis approximately, if you're too lazy to add up the accounts.

I had about 22k warrants on this before and more than doubled my position today. We'll see if I'm a total dumbass for trying to catch this falling knife and way overpaying for these warrants.  

I wanted a lot so I knew I'd have to overpay by a little bit, but it took the stock falling to $12 for them to fill my warrant orders at $3, when by all rights they should have been worth sub-$2 by that point. Warrants in general are super frothy right now across the entire market.

Fair warning to any novice investors - warrants are a weird instrument that you ***don't want to touch*** unless you're willing to read SEC filings. They aren't standard like options, every company has slightly different terms on their warrants, so ***always*** read the warrant agreement attached to the most recent S1A so you know what you're getting into!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It‚Äôs all green _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ nCino Analysis (NASDAQ: NCNO) **Industry Overview**

Financial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.

Banks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That‚Äôs why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.

Simple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino‚Äôs competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.

According to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.

nCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.

**Business Overview**

nCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that ‚Äúhe wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees‚Äô efficiency.‚Äù nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.

nCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.

nCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.  \`

Here is a list of nCino‚Äôs offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.

**Total Addressable Market**

nCino‚Äôs S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.

The bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.

nCino‚Äôs management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino‚Äôs bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.

**Competitive Advantages**

Although I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.

* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**
   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino‚Äôs product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch.Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That‚Äôs like trying to build out Stripe if you‚Äôre an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It‚Äôs better to stick to what you know and what you‚Äôre good at. That‚Äôs why nCino will have high switching costs.
* **Economies of scale.**
   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino‚Äôs products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems.

**Financials**

Like many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.

**January 2020:**

Total revenue = \~$138mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$74mn

Subscription revenue = \~$103mn

Subscription revenue growth = \~60%

Subscription gross profit margin = \~70%

GAAP EBIT margin = -20%

**January 2019:**

Total revenue = \~$92mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$45mn

Subscription revenue = \~$64mn

Subscription revenue growth = \~69%

Subscription gross profit margin = \~69%

GAAP EBIT margin = -25%

**January 2018:**

Total revenue = \~$58mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$28mn

Subscription revenue = \~$38mn

Subscription revenue growth = N/A

Subscription gross profit margin = \~67%

GAAP EBIT margin = -32%

Although nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.

**What‚Äôs Interesting**

The financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.

Salesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the ‚ÄúSalesforce Platform.‚Äù Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.

Some of the hedge funds that I follow ([Link](https://twitter.com/StratusYoung/status/1327453755583893505)) have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.

**Future Questions**

* **Competition**
   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I‚Äôd have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they‚Äôve built over time or is from the founders‚Äô background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.
* **Ownership**
   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don‚Äôt see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.

**Conclusion**

I think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it‚Äôs one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I‚Äôve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.

It‚Äôs had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TLRY Will Be The First Moon Trip of 2021 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ &#x200B;

**Good Afternoon Retards.** Tilray (TLRY) has been having a nice start to 2021. This is only the beginning and there's still time for you to secure your first 10 bagger of 2021. üöÄ

**Why TLRY?**

It's all in the fundamentals. TLRY got the better end, at least in the short term, of the merger deal with APHA. The premium APHA will pay per share in this reverse acquisition will be of great benefit to TLRY's balance sheet. Tilray's massive potential has now been coupled with strong fundamentals. When (Yes, WHEN not if) weed is legalized in the US, Tilray, a company registered in the US, has the foothold in the US that, when combined with APHA's resources and distribution, will be a DOMINANT force in the market. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Not only is Tilray in a good position to take over the US Cannabis market, but it also has a strong presence in Canada, where it is headquartered. The merger with APHA means TLRY will own 17.3% of the Canadian Cannabis market, **by far the largest** market share of any other Canadian Cannabis companies. 

**The US is a HUGE market to be tapped intoüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Georgia Senate elections are **TOMORROW,** as of the writing of this post **BOTH** Democratic candidates are the betting favorites to win. **When this happens, the blue wave is complete and weed is all but legalized in the US.** A Democrat-controlled Senate was the last domino needed to fall. It is reasonable to believe that weed can and will be legalized in the US before the end of Q1 2021. 

Once weed is federally legalized, the market expands **EXPONETIALLY** in the US. Weed will become legal in large states such as New York. **Billions of dollars are just sitting that TLRY is in the best position to take** 

**TLRY is MASSIVELY undervaluedüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

As of 12/31, TLRY is trading at a very attractive 4.23 \* book value. MorningStar gives TLRY a fair value of 14$ (As of 1/1/21). Only 1 of 18 analysts have given TLRY a sell rating.

**Wall Street is bullish on TLRYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Since it has cooled down since the Biden rally, Tilray has consistently been reaching higher highs and higher lows. It is up around 6% at the time I'm writing this post. Put/Call Ratio is .1! Safe to say Wall Street is preparing for the Blue Wave and the legalization of weed, of which TLRY is in the best position to take advantage of the untapped US market.

"Fortune favors the bold"_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GameStop‚Äôs Greatest Ally: Norway &#x200B;

‚ÄúWhat if I told you Norway could land us on the moon tomorrow‚Äù üöÄ üåïüë®üèª‚ÄçüöÄ 

\- random autist 



**Norway** (Yes, we love this country üá≥üá¥ ) has been a loyal and faithful ally to the United States for years. Norway joined the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. You see, Norway is our OG friend.



*‚ÄúBut autist, why are you talking about history and not stonks‚Äù*



Patience, fellow retard. Rockets don‚Äôt lift off without a little commentary followed by a countdown... 3...2...1... üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 



So you see, our loyal friend Norway üá≥üá¥ created a National Fund called ***Statens pensjonsfond Utland*** (SPU) in 1990 which has since grown to become the world‚Äôs largest sovereign fund valued at **over $1 trillion** (10 trillion Krone). For context, Melvin Capital only has $20b (**2% of Norway‚Äôs strength**) 



[Screenshot of GME's Top Holders. Norway owns 1.8 million shares of GME](https://preview.redd.it/gqrrm1c0ic961.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd767f9ed61c1afe1ec9312dee41568b6c5fa34f)



That means Norway is by far the **largest** and **strongest** retard in the room, and he has yet to wake up



But this is where things get interesting üöÄ 



You see, Norway‚Äôs National Fund (SPU)'s goal is to ‚Äúinvest with an **extremely long-term perspective**, enabling it to cope with big swings in value in the short term. The goal of the fund on behalf of the Norwegian people is to generate the **highest possible return** with only moderate risk so that the fund grows and endures‚Äù



The fund only invests in companies with an extremely long-term perspective, and yet GameStop is one of them. You see, Norway‚Äôs National Fund currently owns 1.8 million shares which **represents 2.5% of voting rights**. On top of that, the fund is an **active participant in shareholder and proxy votes**. They frequently ‚Äúhave a regular dialogue with these nearly 1,000 companies‚Äù regarding shareholder decisions. They take the effort to be involved in their investments and will be active voting participants. 



*Where was Norway When the Buy Wall Fell?* 



**Ryan Cohen** üöÄ  can call upon the alliances of old, our loyal ally Norway üá≥üá¥. With the partnership of the century, the fund could increase their investment by a **small $100m** which would be enough to purchase another **5 million shares** (at a very conservative price of $25/share). This would be enough shares to bring **Norway‚Äôs National Fund to a 10% owner** (1.8m shares previous + 5 million new shares = 6.8 million shares out of 68 million outstanding). Norway  could then partner with Ryan Cohen to pull off the ultimate power play of our life time. üöÄ   **This purchase would represent less than 0.01% of the fund‚Äôs over $1 trillion in assets, and would be hardly a drop in the bucket, but the move would give the fund a large upside exposure to the booming Gaming Industry.** As part of the partnership with Ryan Cohen, Norway could even become the center of gaming for all of Europe, with Norway hosting e-gaming tournaments, conferences, and events. GameStop could even partner with Norwegian gaming companies for partnerships during their e-commerce pivot. Imagine an annual gaming conference held in Norway on behalf of GameStop showcasing the latest in the gaming industry coupled with an e-gaming tournament for the coveted ‚ÄúGameStop Championship‚Äù. Ryan Cohen could hand out awards and accolades during the annual event, further boosting the GameStop brand name. You could even have the **King of Norway** üëë (yes they have a king still) crown the champions for further publicity and even more PR stunts. GameStop is the brand name and recognition that everyone needs in order to launch themselves into the future of the gaming industry. 



You see, Gamers around the world have yet to be united under a single gaming hub, one brand name to encompass everything gaming to include buying games, consoles, hardware, swag, but also a brand for hosting, organizing, and sponsoring e-gaming events while also partnering with game developers to forge the future of gaming. GameStop could truly be the ‚Äústop‚Äù for all our gaming needs. 



With **Ryan Cohen and Norway combined owning nearly 25% of GameStop**, (and Ryan CEO with the blessing of Norway), shorts would completely back down, **decisively outgunned by the $1 trillion mega whale that is Norway**. This move alone would instantly trigger the short squeeze üöÄ, but there‚Äôs still more to come which would leave the short squeeze as an after thought; the opening flame to the beginning of something new and awe inspiring.



 GameStop, absent the bears and shorts dragging it down would see a total transformation from brick and mortar store into the digital gaming world entering the future as the face and central hub of the gaming world; as GameStop was always destined to be üöÄ 



With this move, GameStop would **\*instantly\* squeeze** and flush out all of the short sellers and bears. Melvin and the army of shorts üåà üêª would be defeated (and bankrupted). Once the dust settles post squeeze, GameStop would easily settle in around at $50-$60 share price due to the market pricing in the new and unlimited upside potential. After RC takes the helm as the **captain of the rocket ship** üöÄ, GME will continue to grow as it transforms and executes its vision, eventually surpassing $100 per share and onwards to $250 per share and beyond in the future years. GameStop would conquer the gaming world üöÄ  



Norway could easily see their $100m investment return 2x-5x netting them a healthy $200m-$500m profit (perhaps upwards of $1.25 billion in the next few years) while also bringing additional money and business opportunities to Norwegian companies making the move way too good of an opportunity to pass up. A small 0.01% investment would net Norway easily a 200% to 1000% return (ROI) while also boosting the Norwegian economy, helping Norwegian gaming companies, tech companies, and tourism industries. 



We humble degenerates would simply be along for the ride of a lifetime üöÄ 



TLDR; Ryan Cohen partners with Norway to spends 0.01% of their portfolio and buy more GME shares. Ryan Cohen takes over GameStop and our ally Norway becomes the home to all things Gaming in Europe boosting their economy. GameStop moons and we all experience the biggest gains of a lifetime üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

It won't be legalized this week. A motion won't even come to the congress floor this week... but tomorrow evening with the Georgia Senate Runoff, we get to find out if the party with the political will to **legalize the devil's lettuce** has control of the presidency, the house, and the senate. 

Of all the weed stocks in the market, ACB is best poised to benefit from a "double whammy" effect from legalization. Not only will this legal change open up massive markets for the company, it will also assuage investor fears about insolvency and bankruptcy. The financials on ACB are dogshit right now. With a pump in price, though, and improved business prospects, they gain the opportunity to access loans at more favorable rates, and issue more stock at a higher price. The legalization of marijuana (which for all intents and purposes **could happen tomorrow night**) will send this to the moon. 

The best part is that ACB has already shown us the direction it will head in if both democrats win in Georgia. Despite most of the market being down (SPY at -1.3% at time or writing), ACB has rocketed up 12%. The only catalyst for this is how the odds of a democrat win improved over the weekend. 

We also get to look back at how ACB shifted after the general election (when legalization of marijuana became a real likelihood):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4uq0s9hoac961.jpg?width=689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2903e8e11d12716a66994ff6e125c23d49e931c

That pump on Nov 5 was when Biden took the lead. By the 6th, it was obvious that he was going to win. Over that 3 day period, ACB pumped from $4.43 to a high of $14.48. That's a **226% gain in 3 trading sessions**.

For further evidence of what ACB does when a major vote result goes in its way, we can look back at the California election in May, when a major referendum was held regarding the legality of marijuana in that state:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i1ckk6fgbc961.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84ec18dc02d17c2e94e3b11eb7a3f7436db7fd07

Similar to the general election, after this result, the share price of ACB rocketed from $5.80 up to $17.10 in 3 days. That is a **195% gain in three trading sessions.**

Tomorrow night is for all the marbles. It will determine if marijuana is federally legalized. If the dems lose, Jan 8 options purchased today will likely lose 40% of their value by morning. If both dems win, though, there is an honest to god opportunity for a 25 bagger in a single trading week. As it's looking like a 50/50 shot that both dems win, the odds are so heavily stacked in ACB's favor that it's foolish to NOT go balls deep on this one. 

TLDR: OTM 1/8 ACB calls are literally free money and can't go tits up.

3. 700B Market Cap
4. 180k Q4 Deliveries
5. CO2 Cetrificates

&#x200B;

1. New factory speculations

Speculations about a new factory are cooking up, there was a job offer found for a "crucial role" in the constrction of "the biggest factory of the World" for new Teslas Northeast-US factory that Papa Elon teased in Aug 2020 already. Maybe a NY factory expansion, bullish sign nontheless. Read the very good post at the teslamotors sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kq2kwz/tesla_giga_new_york_job_offer_to_play_a_critical/):

&#x200B;

2. 4680 Batteries

For anybody who is in the industry, these are extremely exciting news! The Key to any EV-Maker¬¥s success is more energy density in the batteries and that is what these little bad boys deliver! Read very good Article  by industry insiders cleantechnica [here](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-teslas-new-4680-battery-cell/). That shit is the future!

&#x200B;

3. 700B Market Cap

TSLA just surpassed US$ 700 Billion Market Cap on this day (Jan 04 2021) which is yet another sign to the institutional investers, some of which just keep beeing gay bears, to ride the hypetrain to tendietown.  Colin Rusch ‚Äî managing director and senior analyst at Oppenheimer said in [this](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-1-trillion-market-cap-164802959.html) interview that 1 Trillion is cetrainly possible.

&#x200B;

4. 180k Q4 Deliveries

Tesla Reported 180.000 Deliveries in the Q4 of 2020 which is an ATH and double the Q2 of 2020. The same [chart](https://www.statista.com/chart/8547/teslas-vehicle-deliveries-since-2012/) saying this is just another proof that tesla beat the recession and is soon to be teabagging the lifeless corpses of the other automakers like the market is a 2012 COD:MW Lobby.

&#x200B;

5. CO2 Cetrificates

Maybe the most important point here. Telsa did [proft massively off of CO2 certificates](https://www.electrive.com/2019/06/04/gm-purchases-co2-certificates-from-tesla/) in the past and will continue to do so. Fiat Chrysler and General Motors have to shell out an assload of money to keep regulators pleased. This business is blooming already in the US and Europe and will only be going stronger under biden and the green-influenced EU-Council

Not selling until 100$ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 'Palantir technologies, yes. 5000 shares.' _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone concerned about any company doing buisness in China ever since Ma disappeared? Seriously surprised only a few outlets have reporting about Ma's disappearance from the public over the last couple months. But this kinda tells you that one false comment in China can pretty much do quite a bit of damage.

Which leads me to the question does the risk outweigh the rewards of doing business in china

First the positives

China will become the largest market by 2028 no doubt. It has the largest population in the world which is still relatively untapped by foreign markets and any company looking to grow seems to be adding china into their forcasts from companies like apple, Nike, Disney etc. They also have one of the largest growing middle classes in the world which gives even more incentive for companies to do business in china.

Now the Downsides.

The Chinese government is no stranger to using its power and influence to get their way. We seen this for awhile but its become more public over the recent years. With Companies like nike, activision blizzard and disney giving very muted responses to some of the governments actions pertaining to Hong Kong. We have seen CEO's having to step down as well due to this as well (Cathay Pacific). With Jack Ma's supposed disappearance from the public eye it seems yet again that the government is flexing is muscles and influence to bring business under them control.

Thoughts

Personally I'm starting to get concerned about investing in business in China. I was a big fan of Alibaba for years mainly due to the leadership behind the company. But ever since China pulled the ANT IPO getting concerned that anyone who tries to do business in china or creates a start up in china will have to tread lightly on a tight rope. While the potential upsides are great the downside has been presenting more predominantly over the past few years.

What do you all think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Jim back to talking about us _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ üöÄüöÄüöÄ $NGA (soon to be $LEV) to the moon. SPAC Merger confirmed + Secret deal with Amazon confirmed (3% equity stake with warrants up to 20% stake) üöÄüöÄüöÄ Link in comment. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tendies ahead! A catalyst and a promising chart, that's all we need to go to *Tendie Town!* We have both, with APHA and TLRY. That's right boys, I am going to talk about POT stocks, so if you are bearish on the industry please stop reading. In case you don't know, they are going to merge under the ticker; TLRY. 

Both of the companies are Canadian and they will create the biggest cannabis company.  The new CEO will be the current Chief Executive of APHRIA. After the merger, they will move their HQ to the USA to bolster its presence in the u.s market, which is projected to be a 39-46 Billion market by 2024 compared to the 4.75 Billion Canadian markets.

I think it's a turning point for Tilray. Why? Well, their cost of production is very high (5.38 USD/gram), and margins are very poor at the same time. That is why they have to dilute shareholder's value. While APHRIA's cost of production is much lower (1.41 USD/gram). So TILRAY will capitalize at an instant if they can move their production to APHRIA. But how does APHA benefit from this deal?! They will get Tilray's demand revenue and distribution network.

Of course, there are some involved as well. If the merger will no happen, TLRY will fall as quickly as a one-legged fat man. Secondly, TLRY still has a lot of debt, and it will not disappear as your wife did. Lastly, cannabis is still illegal on the federal level, it will take some time until it will be legalized (if it will)...

Let's head to the charts and draw some magic crayons to see whether it is a good entry point or not because the wrong timing can f&@k up everything. 

I can assure you, that we have here the most predictable chart like ever. If you take a look at the 4-hour chart, you will recognize that we had a massive breakout on 16th Dec. Since we are making lower highs and lows. The general picture remained bullish. I see 3 possible scenarios ahead:

\>1:(bullish): we are not going back below 8.11, and test the 8.71 resistance (high volume needed). This will be a good implication for a trend reversal/ bottom.

\>2:(less bullish): we will bounce back from the 7.61 level and test the upper resistance. Strong momentum and high volume are crucial.

\>3:(bearish): No bounce back will occur, in this case, we will tank until some positive news is coming out.

Position: 9-10 calls Exp: 19.Feb.21 (if the signs will be bullish enough)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | TSLA, NIO, LMND, FUBO, ROKU & Other Stock Market News [01-04] **Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it‚Äôs still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday‚Äôs [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn‚Äôt safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau‚Äôs gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don‚Äôt show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don‚Äôt get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world‚Äôs biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can‚Äôt wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA‚Äôs CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku‚Äôs exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

(NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the ‚ÄúReal Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing‚Äù. SOMPO‚Äôs visionary Real Data Platform, or ‚ÄúRDP‚Äù is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir‚Äôs platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPO‚Äôs RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of ‚Äúreal data‚Äù over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir.

I guess these have been out since q3 of 2020 or so, but I just saw a random add on reddit wsb or somewhere else a couple of days ago.

I'm trying something new in SP500 emini options, but didn't want to risk much until I figure a few things out, so options on the micro contract seem to be perfect, as they are 10 times smaller than eminis.

Unfortunately I don't see nasdaq 100 micro options to have a decent market, at least not right now, hopefully it will change during the regular trading hours. Micro SP500 options show a bit wider quotes compared to the mini contract options, but I did get a fill paying a quarter above what the "fair" price (based on the market in the same strike in e-mini options). 

Anyways, just curious if anyone has any experience to share with trading these new micro futures options. The choice of expiration days is not that great compared to e-mini options, but I'm very excited to try these out.

I'm playing this by buying corn futures (/ZC) but you can buy micro corn futures instead (/XC), which only need around 180 dollars in margin to hold.  You can also buy leaps or call debit spreads on the corn etf if you want.  I've ben scalping corn futures but I just decided to go long /ZC at 487, and I'm going to hold it for a while and set a trailing stop.

TLDR: You'd have better luck finding Bill Cosby a date than losing money on corn

positions:  long /ZC

edit:  I think it's important to add that I'm going to sell before the ag report Jan 12_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir is long term play and takes mainstream finance media news/rating after your own DD only The whole street made bearish sentiment about the Palantir direct listing and the best target price was given is at 13$ for a year out. What do you think they will do if the stock triples in less than a month. They can't go and say that we are updating their 1-2-month-old recommendations to reflect that. They are OK doing it for 30-40% but not for 300%. They have no option but to issue a sell rating and bearish sentiment about it. At a given time there are always bearish and bull sentiments and with enough confirmation bias, you can write whatever. We have seen this in the case of Tesla for e.g. JP Moron has a price target of 80-90$ for tesla and on another hand, they have a buy rating for Nikola. While JPM was telling street to sell Tesla, they loaded themselves in Q3-Q4 in tesla. They offer unique leveraged products to customers based on ARK etfs, which has maxed its Tesla capacity. Long story short, these people are in business to prove them right instead of giving opinions to the general public. There is hardly anyone in the analyst community who understands AI, ML, Big data beyond tech buzz words (Ark is an exception). I spent 15 yrs in the industry and spent the whole of my career building ANN/PCA/SOM models for large 4D simulation problem for projects required multi-billion$ investments and then executing these projects. Today I work in Strategy consulting and with few things i learned over the years, my POV is Palantir is misrepresented by mainstream finance and instead we should focus on more what Karp is saying, how the quarterly number looks, which industry they are entering and who is the real competition

One portion of Palantir is little understood is its 2016 acquisition of Silk Kimono, it has to yield results in the coming days

We listen that Palantir has lost money for a long time. it is important to understand that investing back is not money lost and if we see investments and growth in revenue - it's somewhat a proxy for it

Amazon has done it for 2 decades

Once you stop doing that you become a tech value company under the clock of innovation growth company (which you are no longer)

I can't say in the short term what is the right price, In the long term, i see Palantir at a 10x-20x valuation of its value from direct listing

With my own limited understanding of business and things that I learned (certified nerd, with serious degrees from very serious colleges), I ran an exercise that how to identify companies that have 1 Trillion$ potential by 2030 and under 50 billion$ now - Palantir and SpaceX were two filtered out

so I am long Palantir, SpaceX and off course long Tesla also.

The stock has got volatile as initially, it had a bad press, and then there was no IPO or SPAC euphoria. Once it gained, it became a meme stock. The stock is new in public markets and unique growth stock

So people are still trying to figure it out. What it does, it does best. Customer acquisition is not easy but as they prove their worth, it should get better.

See the case of BP, they pay Palantir 120 million $ a year No oil company pays this much to any of the company for digital and software service‚Äôs And Bp has stated value of Palantir very openly.

They only have one client in all the industries they work In private space. There is a huge opportunity. They have started with a top-down solution model, But they will@make more and more solutions

Possibly new business models, As well.

This company has just started building a sales and marketing team and One thing a good sales team does is to sell proven solutions, again and again, We need 1-2 yrs to see that impact

I assume customer acquisition for Palantir is a 1-1.5 yr process. Thiel has said several times that his focus is to help navigate companies through key inflection points

No other company symbolizes him more than Palantir today. So I don‚Äôt see him bailing out. Alex Karp is super passionate. These guys worry more about the impact they will create and the legacy they will leave than valuation. In their head they see Palantir to be in the same place one day, as we have Google and Facebook._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Friendly reminder, she wants to allow the Fed to buy equities _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Me, an autist, after investing half my Mcdonalds paycheck on PLTR last week because someone told me to on WSB _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Futures _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSBVoteBot Log for Jan 04 2021 Every time a new submission is posted to wallstreetbets /u/wsbvotebot posts a comment that allows you to click and vote to remove that submission.

Report bugs to /u/zjz._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This will be the year millionaires are made from Tesla Puts Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who‚Äôs made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it‚Äôs a ‚Äútech‚Äù company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don‚Äôt be an autist and say something retarded like ‚Äúif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company‚Äù. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it‚Äôs not so please don‚Äôt try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). 

Now, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don‚Äôt get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can‚Äôt find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. 

The only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let‚Äôs see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GET THAT FOOKIN COOKER ON! $SI _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR to the moon, probably. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR Valuation Lies Don't listen to the analyst's lies or the articles about valuation. The concept of valuation is being used as a weapon against you and right now the only reason PLTR üöÄ stock is dropping is because of:

1. Heavy short interest with 70M (as of early December) shares sold short out of \~500m lockup float.
2. Tards losing money on the massive amount of weekly call buying.

&#x200B;

PLTRüöÄ is a good company and the institutions know it. Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley was saying that their IPO in 2020 should be 36-41B ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says)). This price was based off of projections using growth numbers from back in 2018. We know that growth has picked up a bit. As of last Thursday PLTR üöÄ is currently valued at 41B but the last PT and "downgrade" Morgan Stanley gave was  a $17 or a 30B market cap.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley said PLTRüöÄ was worth \~$23.60 (41B market cap) a share and now they are saying it is worth $17 (30B market cap) a share. They are trying to steal tendies from you.

&#x200B;

Edit:  You don't know what moves the institutions are making. They might claim to be on the bears side only to fuck the bears over first chance they get. These institutions will be getting into the stock and we don't know when. Part of the point I am kinda making is that we are getting into the institutions real target price range so bears should watch their butt holes. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Examples Of Palantir's software in use.
