 The market is booming because we are spending better Many people are claiming that the current market is crazy or overvalued.  But historically the stock market is a leading indicator, and our first assumption should be that that is what's happening right now.  Our first thought should be that the market is predicting years of high economic growth just around the corner.    


I'm here to discuss possible reasons for upcoming high economic growth, despite the pandemic and high unemployment.   Of course maybe there will just be a ton of inflation from all the stimulus and bailouts last year.   Maybe the massive death count will result in inheritances that are quickly spent by the younger generation.  Or maybe this other idea has merit:  


Maybe much of America's spending created little future value, and that spending was most impacted by the lockdown.  Instead of traveling, going to concerts, and eating out, people are doing things like remodeling their home offices and creating durable long term wealth.  Unemployed are re-educating and gaining skills that will better grow the future economy.   Maybe the fun and rewarding things we lost were not the best way to create growth, and where the spending has moved is much better long term.    


Thoughts?

Edit: some readers are missing the leading indicator part.  The stock market is generally tied to future activity, not current activity.  Prices reflect expectations of earnings over the coming 25 years.  One or 2 bad years now is still a small fraction of that.  So saying that it's broken because this year has been economically bad is sort of missing the point.

Yes, maybe it's a bubble.  But if it's not, what could be the driver's of the future growth that's predicted by current prices?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did many 1980's stock brokers eventually go broke? 30-40 years later where are they now? Management, retired, rehab?

Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme.

**THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.**

\- Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space.

\- There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter.

\-In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any       small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads.

\- SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch.

\- The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold,

\*In millions of yen

* Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly  enter the EV space as a supplier
* In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.
* Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd.
* Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales
* Operating income from gaming almost doubled
   * 64,987 -> 104,932
   * Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES
   * Pictures decreased by 20%
      * Will recover after covid
   * Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues
      * Decrease of 34.7%
      * $SNE owns over 50% of the market share
      * Previously YOY increase of 25%
* P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth
   * EPS last quarter $3.47 a **285.56% surprise**
   * **Without PS5 sales**
* 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year
* PS5 sales 4.2 million since November.
   * Expectations of 18 million YOY.
   * Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles.
   * Clearly dominates the home console market globally.

* PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D.

Tl;dr

Key points:

* Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban.
* PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.
* Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up.
* Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures.
* Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and  even with current trajectory.
* Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week.

So basically, they killed it and yet the stock is going down....can someone explain this to me?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NYSE: HZO - Hop on board and take your mind off GME We're all aware of what's happening with GME right now and that paired with all the other market mania going on has made me want to look for the bargains everyone else is overlooking. Also, in case you missed it, I did the [Coiled Spring/Nuclear Decay](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kzxz2o/dd_uranium_coiled_spring_or_just_nuclear_decay/) analysis on Uranium a couple weeks back. Anyway, I present to y'all: **MarineMax, Inc.**

**What is MarineMax Inc.?**
MarineMax Inc., which I will refer to by their stock ticker HZO, operates as a recreational boat and yacht retailer in the United States. The company sells new and used recreational boats. That's literally it. It's that simple. It's the [CRMT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undervalued/comments/gol2en/americas_car_mart/) equivalent(but I think better fundamentally) of a great business that has and will continue to prosper as COVID in the US ramps down.

**Metrics:**

* ROIC: 13.8% (Finviz at end of Sep '20) or 19.2% (GuruFocus at end of Sep '20) with a strong history of improving return on capital.
* PEG ratio: .43 (Finviz at end of Sep '20). What's important about this is that they just released their Q1 earnings yesterday and absolutely *obliterated* EPS expectations. The .43 PEG ratio doesn't yet reflect the Q1 numbers, so this will only get stronger. 
* Institutional Ownership: Is over 100%. Some people like seeing this as a sign of confidence in a company, but I usually prefer 20-30 percentage points less to allow room for quick growth. To each their own.
* Debt to Equity: .02 Long Term D/E ratio, .33 D/E ratio. A company not at risk, but still leveraging for growth. They recently expanded their operations and you'll see the additional debt on their balance sheet from this quarter because of this.
* EPS growth for the next 5 years is expected to be 30%, which far outpaces one of their competitors that you may know, Brunswick. 
* The boating industry CAGR is expected to be between 5% and 11% over the next few years but the reports suggesting this don't take into account the effect that COVID had on it because they were published prior to the pandemic. 

**Subjective analysis:**

For me, this is a bet on a strong business remaining strong. The potential upside isn't short term at all and it's a cyclical business, but I think the pandemic forced people to take notice of purchasing a boat as a recreational activity where they don't have to rely on anything else. Low price of oil also helps people consider buying because filling up a boat ain't cheap. Thankfully, as renewable energy takes precedence, oil will continue its slow burn downward giving more folks the opportunity to 'hop on board.'

Everyone's got their eyes on meme stocks, but I have been working on this long thesis for a while and I wanted to share it as this company's earnings are on Feb 4. With that being said:
 
**Tl;dr: Propane demand is at a multi-year high due to outdoor dining and hoarding. Suburban Propane Partners ($SPH) represents a massive opportunity as the stock price has stayed flat among the rapid hike in demand. This is a sleepy company and Wall Street has overlooked these developments. The company reports earnings on Feb 4 before market open. I believe call options represent the best risk/reward for this overlooked stock.**

*Disclosure: I am bullish on SPH and hold a large position in call options. This trade thesis is for entertainment purposes only! I am not an investment advisor. Please do your own research and seek professional investment advice for your portfolio. None of the following statements should be interpreted as financial advice or investment recommendations.*


In August of 2020, I released a document outlining a propane consumption trend, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S as well as the record natural disasters in 2020. I highlighted Suburban Propane Partners as the most effective trade in the space. I bought call options and sold several months later for 16x my original investment, moving on to new trading opportunities.

Last time I released research on this trade, a lot of people requested more detailed information on what specific trades I made. I hold no shares, however, I've included the six options contracts that I am purchasing. I am playing the February and May earnings reports. Please do not follow my trades. Again, do your own research. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice!

**Last Quarter's Earnings**

*$20 Calls for Feb. 19th**

**This Quarter's Earnings**

*$17.5 Calls for May 21st*

*$20 Calls for May 21st*

*$22.5 Calls for May 21st*

*$25 Calls for May 21st*

This stock has a low float and low daily volumes which influenced my decision to play this with calls.

Due to COVID, **outdoor dining has caused an explosive demand for propane patio heaters and fire pits,** which are still backordered with many retailers for the next month and have been extremely difficult to get since September. This has created a panic in the propane market and has many businesses and home owners desperately attempting to **buy and store as much propane as they can**. After experiencing shortages of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, masks, meat, and other goods last year, it appears that consumers are afraid of going without heat this winter. This is adding to the panic and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, **as a normal supply of propane meets an abnormally high demand.**

Here we can see that [propane prices ramped up this winter](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/propane), but Suburban's [share price has stayed put around $15.00](https://i.imgur.com/DenAOXe.png).
        
**Residential consumers in a number of areas have been experiencing a propane shortage**, even when their tanks are on an auto-refill schedule with their distributor. As a result, complaints are skyrocketing and in some states legislators have even been forced to get involved. However, this **crisis is only being reported on by local and regional news outlets**. The mainstream media is ignoring this crisis in the propane market. They are most likely trying to avoid another hoarding situation, like the toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and mask crises last year, by keeping the shortage as quiet as possible. **As a result, this crisis is currently flying under Wall Street's radar. I believe that will change when SPH reports earnings on Feb 4th.**

Let's take a quick look at the facts. **Wall Street projects earnings for SPH will be 14% lower than the same quarter last year and the stock price is 33% lower than the same time in January 2020.** However, Suburban Propane has **beat analyst projections in both of the last two quarters.** The next two earnings reports are usually the best two quarters because of the **cold weather**. However, I believe the outdoor dining trend has created an unusually large demand for commercial propane this year, which is fueling the panic causing a shortage, so these two winter quarters could do exceptionally well. Wall Street analysts place the fair value of the stock at $19.33, which is 21% above the current stock price of $15.00.

All the social data I have collected indicates consumers are buying propane at record levels. Earnings for the months of October-December will be released on Feb 4th. Based on my research, I am expecting **earnings to outperform Wall Street's projections for the 3rd time in the last year.** If **earnings merely equal last year's results for this same quarter, they will beat projections by 14%!** But, all signs are pointing to a much **stronger propane market** than last year (just look at the price of propane), so I am **expecting earnings to beat projections** by much more than 14%. Furthermore, I see no signs of these trends changing any time soon. I am predicting the price will return to the 2020 price levels in the mid $20's range, by or before May 2021. I am ALL IN on call options for February and May!

Suburban Propane is rapidly becoming the market leader in **clean propane**. While propane is the cleanest fossil fuel, it does still produce some emissions. However, a chemical called rDME can reduce propane emissions to almost nothing because rDME actually has a net negative carbon footprint! Last fall, Suburban Propane purchased a 39% stake in Oberon Fuels, which is a large producer of rDME. In light of the **clean energy agenda of the new administration, I believe this is a hugely significant development for SPH that will position it as perhaps the only fossil fuel company with a clean energy focus.** In addition, on January 26th, Suburban Propane registered a **new logo** with the US Patent Office, using a green leaf instead of their former red logo. [Along with the slogan "Go green with Suburban Propane."](https://imgur.com/ae0d502d-8835-49de-8771-ffe6d3856fb0) Clearly, this is one fossil fuel company that takes the clean energy agenda very seriously. I believe this bodes well for SPH over the next few years.

As you will see from the samples below, I have surfaced quite a bit of chatter from various social sites, proving there is a very **real nationwide shortage of propane**. Over the past five years, google searches for propane have been in a steady uptrend, but COVID has rapidly accelerated this trend and certain propane related search terms are showing extremely high search volume.

I stumbled upon AFL while looking for an undervalued dividend payer that has some potential growth. I get insurance companies don’t have explosive growth but AFL is trading at a 7-8 PE. I personally thing that’s insane especially when the 5 year average for the company is a 15 PE. They only payout about 23-25% of earnings and their yield at the moment is in the high 2%. Furthermore, they have beaten earnings constantly and keep a modest revenue increase while their EPS grew 58% when compared to the last TTM. When it comes to growth they are steadily increasing clientele in places like Japan to compensate for the competition in the states. Therefore I ask again, am I brain dead and missed something or is this a genuinely undervalued play?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The bullish case for Tanger Outlets (SKT) After witnessing the GME explosion, I went looking last week for other stocks with high short %, and ideally low volume.  One in particular stood out to me -- SKT, Tanger Outlets.

[The average volume over the past 3 months is 3.55m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/key-statistics?p=SKT), and has been slowly building -- the avg volume over the past 10 days is 10.82m, so some scouting and positioning has clearly already been done.  

The float for this stock is only 89.64m shares.  That's way less than other recent meme stocks like NOK (5.6 **billion**), BB (508 million), and comparable to AMC (102m).  

Given that AMC has a similar float, I then checked out the short % of the float -- for SKT it's **75.26%**.  AMC is 38.12%.

Furthering the case for SKT, [the open interest in puts has been dropping drastically](https://twitter.com/TeresaTrades/status/1354865732748599296/photo/1).  4th largest OI put decrease.

SKT recently reinstated their dividend, and being a dividend/real estate stock, this seems to be one that is safer to hold, and that current holders are less likely to try to exit on a pop.  I live right near one of their outlets, and you wouldn't think we were in a pandemic with all the traffic it has.  Even if malls begin to shutter their stores, outlet stores generally stay open as the stores relocate their inventory to the outlets for clearance, figuring bargain hunters will go scoop them up.

At the start of this year, a new CEO was installed - Stephen Yalof, who previously headed up Simon Property Group (SPG).  He was CEO of SPG starting July 2014, when SPG stock was at 168.19, and hit a high of 227 a few years later.  He ended up departing SPG in April 2020, obviously after the pandemic/crash.

Melvin Capital, as of 9/2020, [was short 1 million shares of SKT](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354162604311261189/photo/1).

This seems like an extremely attractive target for a short squeeze to me and I ended up buying shares and leaps last week, and intend on holding for a while.  The charts the past couple days have been following other meme stocks, but not as drastic -- up 10%, down 8%, etc.  Twice today the stock bounced off the 14.50-15.00 range, and it seems like the [AH orders showed that as well](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_279693951.png)

There's certainly some resistance at $20, but given the low volume and high % of float, OI put interest dropping sharply, I think it's a matter of time before this one hits the radar of more traders looking for the next thing.  Good risk/reward play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An explanation of why @RobinhoodApp non-nefariously restricted trading [update:  here's another way to start to understand this situation if what's written below is too dense  
Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull on the Robinhood/GameStop situation  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM]  

This explanation is from Silent Cal @KralcTrebor

https://twitter.com/KralcTrebor/status/1354952686165225478

Ok - here's my best explanation of why @RobinhoodApp restricted trading in the short-squeeze stocks.

Spoiler: the story isn't the Ken Griffen called Janet Yellen who instructed DTCC to raise margin on Robinhood to force them to shut down the speculative buying.

Here goes ...

Robinhood (RH) is a broker. They don't execute stock orders themselves. They sign up customers, route their orders to executing brokers, and keep track of who owns what. RH is also its own clearing broker, so they directly settle and custody their clients' securities.

Yes, RH is paid by Citadel to handle executing some of its order flow. This isn't as nefarious as it sounds - Citadel Equity Securities is paying to execute retail orders because they aren't pernicious (like having 500x the size behind them).

RH customers buy and sell stocks. Those trades don't settle (settle = closing, the exchange of cash for security) until T+2, two days later. Depending on the net of buys/sells, RH is on the hook to pay or recieve that net cash. That's credit risk.

NSCC is the entity that takes that credit risk. It matches up the net buyers and sellers, post-trade, and handles the exchange of cash for security. To mitigate the credit risk that one of the clearing brokers fails, they demand the brokers post a clearing deposit with them.

The NSCC is required to do this by SEC rule, tracing to Dodd-Frank.

Here's the details: https://sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf

Everyone posts, and if a broker fails, then NSCC takes any losses out of that broker's deposit, then some from NSCC, then from everyone else (the other brokers).

This is a post-crisis idea encoded in Dodd-Frank that making everyone post collateral reduces the credit risk and systemic risk and such.

So how does the NSCC clearing deposit get calculated?

It's basically Deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market ... math and jargon!

Let's use an example. Say Fidelity has clients who bought 2bn of stock and sold 1.5bn of stocks. First, net down buy/sell between customers in the same stock.

Say that leaves 1bn buy and 0.5bn sell. Run some math to answer "that won't move more than X with 99% odds in the next 2 days." Let's say that's 3% of the net, so 3% * (1bn-0.5bn) = 0.15bn = 15m. That the 99% 2d VaR.

Next, we ask "is any one stock net more than 30% of the net buy/sell" ... and if it is, then we take 10% of that amount and add it as the Gap Risk Measure. So if Fidelity customers bought 200m IBM, then add 20m to that 15m. That's Gap Risk Measure.

Deposit Floor Calc is some thing that looks at the 1bn buy and the 0.5bn sell and does a small calc and adds them, so that if the first calc (99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure) is small, then this floor will keep the overall from being tiny.

Then, last, you add Mark-to-Market. Basically if your customers bought IBM at 140/shr and it goes to 110/shr before it settles for cash at 140/shr, the NSCC has 30/shr of credit exposure to the clearing broker and that amount gets added to the required collateral posted to NSCC.

There are some other items, but that's the basic idea - full details are here: https://dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/policy-and-compliance/NSCC_Disclosure_Framework.pdf

The NSCC sets the framework, but it is spelled out in Dodd-Frank that they have to do so by law.

These deposits are held in the Clearing Fund at the NSCC.

Financials are here: https://dtcc.com/legal/financial-statements

They had 10.5bn in the Clearing Fund as of Sep 30, 2020.

This is the regime post-Dodd-Frank. NSCC updated it's rules in 2018 to improve the VaR calc and to add the Gap Risk Measure.

How did this impact Robinhood?

Well, let's say Robinhood had $20bn of client assets starting 2021. Those customers used to trade $1bn/d say. What is the context for Clearing Deposit? Say 2 days it's a little unbalanced and it's 1.2bn buy and 0.8bn sell. Ok, that's probably around 12m, maybe 20m deposit.

If they take in $600m of new deposits and say $400m wants to buy GME. Plus of their $20bn existing, say there is $400m of GME buys over the past 2d. Then the picture could look like 2.0bn buys and 1.0bn sells, which might normally be 30m deposit. But volatility went up. A bit.

Now 99% 2d VaR is much higher. It should be 20x higher for their net portfolio, but the formula will smooth it out some. Maybe it's ~4x bigger. So just on VaR, they have to post 120m now. That they should have.

The Gap Risk Measure is what kills them.

If GME is over 30% of their net unsettled portfolio, then they are required to post 10% of all the GME buys. So if that's 800m, they have to post another 80m. And there is no limit to it. As long as their clients are up P&L, the mark-to-market covers it.

But if RH takes in 500m of new money and 300m buys GME, then at minimum they are looking at posting 30m+ from just that exposure at NSCC. They cannot use client money - RH has to use their own resources to post. And if GME stock drops, RH has to post the loss pre-settlement.

This would also explain why RH drew its credit lines and said vague things about clearing requirements.

Robinhood Is Said to Draw on Bank Credit Lines Amid Tumult
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult
(alternative URL:  https://archive.is/sLhsm)

The policy goal here is to avoid the central plumbing entities from taking credit risk. In reality, such regulations raise costs and create barriers to entry. It raises profits for entities like DTCC (which owns NSCC and is itself owned by Wall St)

RH offered to open up stock market investing more broadly. They succeeded, clearly. But the regulations didn't change - there are still pro-Wall St, pro-incumbent rules and capital requirements. It's one of the most highly regulated industries in our nation.

So @aoc is right to ask how it can be that Robinhood stopped its clients from buying certain securities. And what she'll find is that the reason is that Dodd-Frank requires brokers like RH to post collateral to cover their clients' trading risk pre-settlement.

And it isn't the Fed or SEC who sets the rules. It's the Wall St owned central clearing entity itself, DTCC, that makes its own rules. So when the retail masses decided to squeeze the short-sellers, in the middle of crushing them, it was govt regulations which tripped them up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is IPOE trading at such a discount considering the SoFi merger?

I've read approx $2B will be used to pay down debt, but even if we look at IPOE at a $6B valuation it's quite a ways off still.

I wanted to get some opinions on Razer stock as a medium/long term investment.

I'm still relatively new to the stock investment topic, but nonetheless I quickly gained interest in Razer stock. Obviously a bit of personal connection plays into this interest, but also given the plans and projections for the coming years, I would imagine there is potential here.

With the gaming industry continuing to grow and ever greater recognition of e-sports itself, Razer is already in this space as a huge player in gaming.

In addition to that, they are trying to become a fin tech in their territory and provide people with offerings in the payment sector as well.

What are ur thoughts on that?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ On Banks - from one of the most respected research houses (MacroStrategy)  Banks’ liquidity and capital positions have literally never been so  robust, making operational downside risks extraordinarily limited. With **US banks approximately 3x as liquid and 3x better capitalised**  than they were going into the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), they are  worlds apart from the over-leveraged, supremely vulnerable sector of  13-14 years ago.

Yet it is **not just the banks which  are in a far stronger place. Their private sector debtors have been  largely bailed out by the US Treasury**, even before the  recession really had time to get under way. So, the risk from  non-performing loans (NPLs), based on the ballooning of bank deposits,  appears systemically negligible. 

**The  banks’ positive gearing to reflation, both from the point of view of  net interest margins (NIMs) and risk appetite, combined with  below-market performance, appear to offer an extraordinarily attractive risk/reward trade-off.**

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  "upgrade in quality" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early "for their own good" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said "F it, MARKET ORDER" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, "pros"!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

Ok, but seriously, I hope that's not how it ends. I guess we just take it day by day at this point.

Apologies for the length.  Good luck in the market!

Yesterday, I noticed [20M in after hours volume](https://imgur.com/gallery/XFMJAUI) on $FNMA and 11M for $FMCC.  This seems highly unusual considering the full day’s volume (before the after hours trade) for $FNMA was only 18M.  

With a pending decision from SCOTUS in Collins, this seems correlated, but I’m speculating.  There is other recent news here as well though... the government [filed a motion to dismiss](http://www.glenbradford.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-1912-0054.pdf) all derivative shareholder suits in the Fairholme suit.  

[Bill Ackman has also chimed in](https://youtu.be/MBSug5ftggY) with his opinion on these being undervalued.  With housing booming, profits soaring, and just underlying basic need for the GSEs, I’m curious what will happen if/when SCOTUS issues a favorable ruling within the next 100 days.  

Are these forever foresaken or is there upside here? If you’ve been following the GSE saga, what are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RKT getting ready for lift off This company is undervalued it is ridiculous. Revenue of 9B the past 2 quarters. The housing market is at all time highs and the MBA refinance index 2-3x higher than the year prior. This stock is about to announce ER which by all means should be another record quarter for them even though this is suppose to be the non busy part of the year for them. Last quarter they issued a 1B dollar buyback program and this quarter they are suppose to announce a new partnership and possible dividend. The fed has already come out and said that they will keep interests rates at near 0 until 2023. Short interest on this stock is 31% most recent numbers show 34% and institutional ownership has only been going up.

I’m long this stock I’ve got $520 shares and if it continues the pullback I will look to add more.

Would like to know if anyone thinks differently to see where my research and assumptions may be wrong._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What stocks are you looking to grab at a possible discount? With so much attention to only a few stocks we saw a small dip in the S&P500 on Wednesday. This is likely to repeat while also offering a good opportunity to buy.

My current picks would be NIO, SQ, AAPL, SE/LMND_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'd like to discuss the green energy executive orders Biden signed yesterday and its impacts on the market. With all the hullabaloo about GME and other meme stocks, this kinda flew under the radar. President Biden issued multiple climate change related executive orders yesterday, some with potentially big implications for the market.

Big highlights:

* Replace federal vehicle fleets with EVs (good for EVs, energy storage tech, bad for traditional car companies and fossil fuel companies)

* Remove subsidies from fossil fuel companies (potentially huge impact on fuel companies, drillers, refiners, car companies, and more depending on what subsidies are targeted)

* Redirect fossil fuel subsidies to clean energy initiatives and to incentivize green companies (great news for renewable energy companies, possible help for solar companies and installers?)

* Pause new oil/gas drilling leases (negative impact to fossil fuel drillers, and fossil fuel exploration)

* Massive grid improvements to deal with new sources of industry (utility plays here? Durable equipment plays for things like transformers?)

* Double offshore wind energy production by 2030 (wind energy play)

* A new civilian climate corps to help with cleaning forests, waterways (potentially good for fishery and forestry plays)

I'm just curious who else had seen this, and what your thoughts are. There is a lot more but these were the big ones that stood out to me.
