Why have US and UK stock markets reacted so differently to the Coronavirus pandemic? Looking at the FTSE100 vs the S&P500, it seems that UK markets have struggled to recover from the shock experienced at the beginning of this year and have strugfled to recover. Conversely, a smaller shock was experienced by the US market and it has (more than) recovered to pre-covid levels.

Maybe my mistake is believing that covid is the biggest influence on markets at the moment? However, if this is not the case, then what explains this difference?

Alternatively, maybe what I'm missing is the construction of these indices? Perhaps it's due to the frequency with which their constituent stocks are changed?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mercado Libre beats earnings expectations $MELI MercadoLibre Q3 Results Exceed Expectations

MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentine online marketplace, on Wednesday posted Q3 diluted EPS of $0.28, swinging from a loss of $2.96 a year ago.

That beat the $0.24 consensus estimate of analysts polled by Capital IQ.

Revenue jumped to $1.12 billion from $603 million, exceeding analysts' projection of $984.8 million. 

During Q3, unique active users increased 92.2% to 76.1 million, while gross merchandise volume jumped 62.1% to $5.9 billion. 

I think this is a huge sign of what’s to come w this company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AO.com. Rapid growth stock AO.com. With 75% share price growth in one month and 511% growth in the past year, does anybody think the company can sustain this growth long-term? I tend to invest in companies that I like. I’ve purchased from AO.com and I liked the experience of using them but the growth over recent weeks has been phenomenal. So much so that I invested a fair amount of money, pulled out after it dropped for a couple of days and lost as a result. I should have just stuck with it, as it’s back up again now. Does anybody think this company has long-term growth potential?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RKT earnings coming up Is anyone talking about this stock? It hit a 30 day low of $18.23, and since then has been rallying for earnings. 

This stock IPO’d in early August at $18. We’re still at very close to that stock price, and earnings will be announced on November 10 after market. 

They are anticipated to announce $RKT auto, which would further position the company as a fin-tech company with an easy-to-use platform that is dominating market share of mortgage origination sector. 

And of course, refinances were all-time high with rates at an all-time low. Housing market has still been robust through the pandemic, home sales and prices close to all time high. 

I anticipate a major upward movement leading up to, and following, the earnings date. In addition, I’m long-term bullish on this cheap stock. Seems like it is an undervalued unrefined diamond right now. 

It is an already profitable and established company with great financial metrics as welll. 

Any other thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Company analysis So I've looked at many stocks financials, and that's the way I screen them basically, I checked for 10 years of good revenue growth, P/E growth, operating profit growth, good debt to equity etc...
Recently, I've been looking at 3 companies that all satisfied my screening for growth. (ABBV Abbvie laboratories, GSK GlaxoSmithKline, CO Global Cord Blood Corporation). ABBV and GSK both pay good dividends with ABBV having a great growing dividend. CO looks like a brilliant value stock with a PE of around 7.
I've read their recent annual reports and I still think they are great companies. Would this warrant me investing in them or should I be digging deeper?
Maybe I can find other companies that can grow larger with better annual returns. What is a good way of predicting future annual returns and intrinsic value? I have a rough method but very basic.
Should I only be buying companies with an intrinsic value higher than their enterprise value?
What do you look for in annual reports and how long does it take you to read them?

Thanks for your helps guys._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unilever Unification As some of you might know Unilever NV shares will be exchanged 1:1 to Unilever Plc shares as per Nov 27. I noticed there's a discrepancy between the NV and plc ADR prices which got me interested. At the time of writing NV ADR trades for $60.13 while the PLC ADR trades for $60.51. I get that there should be some difference (plc shares don't get taxed 15% divi tax) but shouldn't that difference be very minimal as the NV shares will be exchanged for PLC shares at the end of the month?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some of your worst trades? What are some of your worst trades? Provide details like How much you invested and how much did you lost and Why did you invest in the stock to begin with if you don’t mind. I am sure there are a lot of horror stories out there. 

I thinks it’s a good idea for all us to learn from each other’s mistakes. I bought into FSR pre merger but still when it was in the highs. I expected it to run like HYLN, NKLA and VLDR but it just kept tanking. It just tanked from 21 dollars to 8.25. I guess I jumped on the hype bandwagon prematurely and ended losing quite a bit of money. And after I sold my shares FSR started pumping again and hit 12 today morning. The plan for FSR delivering was in place and it looked good but I discounted that investors would not throw money into a company that has zero revenue and that was my mistake.


Edit 1: option trades count as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's time to roll out options on smaller lots of shares. The way they're traded now is extremely restrictive for the average investor. Lots of 100 shares/only -mean that going long, strikes reasonably near the money for anything trading in the three digits or higher will require a sizable capital outlay (spreads are a way to mitigate that but have their own caveats) And on the flip side you also need to hold a huge amount of stock to sell covered calls, a very viable strategy paired with long-term investing. The price of a stock should not shut out your options with options (pun intended). Introduce contracts on lots of 10, even 1 share. We have 0 commission trades now. We have fractional shares. It's time to remove that last roadblock for the little guy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uber + Lyft up big after Prop 22 passes in CA Uber is up 12% right now while Lyft is up around 9%

https://www.investors.com/news/uber-stock-lyft-stock-california-proposition-22-vote-gig-economy/

> Proposition 22 will roll back California's controversial AB5 labor law, which went into effect in January. The legislation mandates that companies reclassify many independent contractors as full-time employees.

> But Prop. 22 would exempt ride-sharing and delivery companies from AB5. It would also establish pay requirements for drivers and other benefits such as sick leave and unemployment compensation.

> "The underlying business models for Uber and Lyft were hanging in the balance if Prop. 22 did not pass in California to keep the contractor model," Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.

> He added the vote was a "landmark victory" for Lyft and Uber stock, which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the Golden State. "This removes a significant overhang and dark cloud for the likes of Uber and Lyft," Ives wrote._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will Tesla reach the same market cap as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google one day? I think there are some obvious business expansions for Tesla... Such as getting into auto-insurance. And creating an autonomous taxi network. 

But is that enough for Tesla to reach the same market cap as the big 4? Right now the market cap of the largest auto insurance company is 60 billion. 

Uber and Lyft have combined market caps of 80 billion. 

Tesla has a market cap of 400 billion. So maybe that adds another 200-300 billion dollars of value to the company. 

But Microsoft is at 1.65 trillion, Amazon 1.6 trillion, Apple 1.98 trillion, and google 1.19 trillion. Once Tesla catches up (if it can even reach 1 trillion) they could well be worth much more than that by then._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are there any analysts that you trust and have had a a relatively good track record? So the majority of analysts and their articles or videos are bunk. J.P. Morgan [released an article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-time-to-take-your-profits-from-tech-stocks-jp-morgan-says-11604348246) two days ago that recommended selling tech, right as it hit bottom. I respect the transparency of [The Kendall Report](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqNq7kQMKvgf_LXxFmPRQA), but his use of almost pure technical analysis makes some of his judgements nearsighted and overly susceptible to momentum with today's volatility. I often read [this random SeekingAlpha guy's articles](https://seekingalpha.com/author/quandaryfx#regular_articles) because he's had an amazing track record of being wrong in the short term more than 70% of the time with regards to his calls on volatility.

But that does bring up the issue, are there any analysts you know of that do have a reasonably good track record when it comes to recognizing the near-term tops and bottoms of a market?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Foolish to invest (specifically things you can't export) in Taiwan? Example in mind is property. It's there on the island, you aren't getting it out of there should there be an issue. At least with a business, you, you would take a hit but least you can pack up and operate from another base.

I was looking at buying prop in Taiwan but was wondering if that's foolish given by 2051 (depending on where the CCP decide to colonise next) it may not be subject to the more liberal laws it has today.

Trying to keep the political argument to a minimum. Is that political instability/unpredictably effectively render any property investment in Taiwan foolish?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in Cannabis Stock I am looking to invest in US based cannabis stock. More and more states are legalizing, including my home state of NJ. I've done some digging and found CRLBF, CURLF, and TCNFF. I've also heard of TRSSF, which seems to specifically have a stronger foothold around PA and NJ. 

I'm not really interested in penny stocks, and I think the majority of cannabis stocks tend to look like that. I've also noticed none of these mentioned stocks trade on Robinhood, so far that and other reasons I think it's time for me to take my investments elsewhere (so sidebar I would be interested in opinions on what broker a newer person might want to use). Any info would be greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pepsico vs Ko So in my opinion soda consumption will decrease in the future, as people will be more cautious about their health. That being said, Pepsico is more diversified, has a better outlook on the future, and owns more assets as Coca Cola mostly has partnerships only.

His stance is that he's investing in the global company, NIO, which has nothing to do with the CPP since he supports the growing EV market.
