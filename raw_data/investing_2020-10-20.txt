Jim Chanos said he was joking that he’d invest in Virgin Galactic and that’s fine that’s his opinion.  He’s a old school investor and was brutally wrong about Tesla and a lot of technology company’s.   

I agree that Virgin Galactic has no revenue ... yet and has a lot to prove.  Specifically finishing up final testing this fall and launch of commercial operations in Q1 2021 with the first flight being with Richard Branson.   

The business of space tourism is very profitable and if they can deliver and scale the business with 5 spaceships by 2023 as planed they will be flying 1590 people a year making over $400 million of gross profit per year.  This includes projected revenue from training NASA astronauts and the Mach 3 sonic plane.

Traders worry every day about which cryptocurrency to invest in. The crypto market, however, is still difficult to predict. There is no simple answer as to which coins will win the race in 2020.

**The guarantee: Bitcoin**

Bitcoin will always be a good investment. Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention continues to lead in terms of market capitalization and trade volume. Almost every crypto exchange can trade Bitcoin and it is the cryptocurrency that is used the most.

If you can or just want to invest in a single cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is always a good choice. The first true peer-to-peer currency is still the number 1 cryptocurrencies. So far, there is no indication that Bitcoin will be thrown from the throne in the foreseeable future.

The next Bitcoin Halving will also take place in 2020. This means that fewer coins are distributed during mining. The available amount grows more slowly, so that every single coin becomes more valuable as soon as the demand increases. Many investors expect price increases after halving.

It is not guaranteed that Bitcoin will experience the biggest growth in 2020. But it’s the most stable cryptocurrency to invest so far.

Advantages:

– Strongest market dominance, largest trading volume

– The most widely used cryptocurrency worldwide

– Secure facility

**Bitcoin alternatives**

Bitcoin clones could also be a safe investment: cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Litecoin (LTC) or Bitcoin SV (BSV). These cryptocurrencies are mostly faster and more technically advanced than Bitcoin, but will not be able to break its market dominance in the foreseeable future.

They have the same purpose: digital means of payment for the Internet. Your prices often move parallel to the Bitcoin price, but can also rise or fall with a time delay. Some of them have the potential to grow faster than their template, but it is not guaranteed.

– Good alternative to diversification

– Potential for big price gains

**Binance Coin (BNB)**

The Binance Coin (BNB) is the cryptocurrency of the largest exchange in the world: Binance. The Exchange has expanded considerably in recent years and plans to continue doing so in 2020. An investment in the Binance Coin is equivalent to an investment in the Exchange.

The Binance Coin can be used to trade on the cryptocurrency exchange. If you buy cryptocurrencies with her, you get discounts on your purchases. Binance coins therefore have a benefit for every trader. Binance will soon start a decentralized exchange called Binance DEX, on which in turn the in-house cryptocurrency can be used as a means of payment.

That makes the Binance Coin extremely liquid. Shortly after the start of the cryptocurrency, it was able to get a permanent place in the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. In 2019, the BNB price tripled.

– Extremely liquid cryptocurrency

– Currency on the largest exchange: Binance

– Could already gain good prices

**Tron (TRX)**

Tron is a blockchain platform from Justin Sun, an important figure in the crypto scene. An independent ecosystem for the entertainment industry is to be created on the platform. Every user should be able to upload their own videos, pictures, music, texts etc. without being dependent on companies like YouTube.

Basically, it’s a smart contract platform, similar to Ethereum (which is also a good investment). Users can upload data, make it available to other users and write their own smart contracts.

Tron now attracts a large number of investors. There is a lot of potential in the project. In 2017, Tron’s price rose from EUR 0.0018 to EUR 0.045. In 2018 and 2019, the cryptocurrency gained more and more ground in the crypto world and is now among the top 15 in terms of market capitalization._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How had NKLA not yet crashed? Lawsuit filed against by shareholders! Thoughts? As most of you know, all the things regarding NKLA - its' CEO and the fraud he committed, its' prototype and design, partnership with GM, and so many other issues have been surfacing up in the last couple of months. 

In the meantime, the stock has stayed pretty consistent. My question is, how has it not yet crashed? I mean, they are simply a framework of a company without any underlying infrastructure - not just of a car company, but of just a company. Sure, this is blind faith at its' finest but who is still holding on to it?

Any thoughts from others who are observing this phenomena?

Hello everyone,

(I tried posting this in r/RobinHood but thought it might be better addressed here)

I have what might be a very basic question that might seem very obvious but I am fairly new to investing and need some help understanding some of the fundamentals. Please forgive me if my question exudes ignorance. I tried Google but could not get an answer, so I appreciate any help provided to me.

I use a combination of SeekingAlpha and Barron's to look at a company's financial numbers. Most of the time I understand how a reported EPS for a quarter is calculated. If I see, for example, under the earnings tab that the most recent quarter has an EPS of $0.14 and I check this against the Net Income/Diluted Shares Outstanding for that quarter, I usually see an agreeance. However, I have come across two companies today that posted negative net income for the Q2 2020, showed a negative diluted EPS in the income statement but the earnings tab said they posted a positive EPS for that quarter. For one of the companies, Seeking Alpha has an earnings report of $0.14, RobinHood lists an earnings of $0.14 but the income state for the company reports negative net income for the quarter and further down, a diluted EPS of ($0.07).

So the question being:

Is it possible to report negative net income, a negative diluted EPS, and yet report positive earnings for that same quarter? This doesn't seem right to me. Again, new to this so please forgive any mistakes in my reasoning.

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*"A" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a "****Strong Buy****".*

*"B" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a "****Buy****".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Basically, I’ve inherited a significant sum of money at 23, and have decided to invest it aggressively for the next decade. However, to hedge against risk, I’m still investing in the total stock market as well, in tandem to diversifying which sectors I invest in.

Is this a legitimate strategy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Holding ~5% cash in my portfolio for a “rainy day” (eg, market correction). Arguments pro or con? Why I should either: keep my cash holding as is, hold more cash, or invest it now (and if so, in what)? Similarly, if we do have a correction (a lot can happen in the next few weeks) how should I put my cash to work? A broad ETF (eg, SPY) or something more niche (eg, ARKK) growth stock with momentum (take your pick: ZM, TSLA, SHOP, etc) or a beat up value stock (eg, T, F, CCL, UAL, etc)? Thanks!

Edit: just wanted to add that (I’m pretty sure) this is my first post, so thank you to everyone who takes the time to reply here. Forget about what those (entertaining) WSV idiots say; this community is great!

Edit 2: I’ve upped my cash position to ~10%. Plan to hold until around election time. Just 2 weeks away!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Earnings Call Notifications I recently switched from Robinhood to Fidelity and i’m curious is fidelity notifies you about earnings calls on stocks you hold or watch the way Robinhood does? Or if there is another way to be notified. 
I found that feature pretty helpful on Robinhood._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will HVAC take off after promising United study was released last week? United just released a momentous study from the US Department of Defense who conducted a rigorous study over the last 6 months to see how covid could spread in airplanes. Their results were astonishing. Only .003% of infectious particles entered the breathing zone of other passengers -- even when every seat of the plane is occupied which means contacting covid while flying is virtually impossible. They said this was in large part to the cabin replenishing the air every 8 minutes, the HEPA air filtration, and people wearing masks.  

That's a huge finding. My main takeaway is that we have conclusive evidence of a safe way to gather a large group of people in a confined space. Right now, I think virtual boardrooms all across the country and saying "United found a way to safely group 200+ people together with virtually no risk of spreading covid. This is the tools they used. How can we do this at our company?" 

I think air purification and filtration will be the next sector to take off after the work from home tech boom. As we approach winter, outdoor dining won't be able to continue in 80% of the US. People will have to move indoors for dining if they want to go out. Sports arenas will want basketball and football fans back in their stands. I bet we will see some pretty big leaps in terms of air filtration investments to make these indoor activities safe. 

I could be totally and completely wrong on this but any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated while I try to find companies who could be at the forefront of this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will Zoom decline after COVID? No doubt the company has seen a meteoric rise largely due to COVID and the need to work from home. Society is running off of internet connectivity right now and Zoom is filling that void for many.

Hi, I'm new to the game, so as most of the forum is U.S. related, I was wondering if there were Europeans here who invest, who could recommend good (commission free) brokerage firms in the EU.  Do I need to use a brokerage firm in my country or can I use some brokerage firm in another EU country?

Also, is it possible for an EU citizen to use a U.S. brokerage firm for investing, and if yes - what are pros and cons of that?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In general, are cash balances and liquid investments easy to forecast in-between earnings releases? What I mean is if company ABC released earnings let's say 2 months ago when their liquid assets were of $50M, is it usually easy for analysts to infer what amount of liquid investments would the company have today? I guess it would depend on the industry, but I'm curious to know to what level of accuracy analysts can extrapolate this in time from past earnings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XPEV price forecast I know these forecasts are bullshit and that they are always getting adjusted after major price changes but... who in the world thought about this one.

I have some doubts and need clarification on how to interpret a stock's beta value. 

- Beta is the measure of volatility of a security relative to a market. 

-  Beta is equal to the slope of best fit line between the market returns and security returns. 

- Suppose we look at yearly returns. A Beta of 2 means if the market yearly return increased by 1, the equity yearly return increases by 2.

- But how do I interpret the Beta of 2 with respect to the volitility of the equity relative to the market? Can I say the equity is twice as volatile? 

- Would comparing the standard deviation of equity returns and stabdard deviation of market returns be a better way to measure the volatility of an equity to market?

From the post (You should just read it, its not that long)

>Overall sales didn’t instantly fall off after expiration, because the supplementary unemployment benefits were so large that they facilitated many receiving unemployment actually accumulating savings. There were also the 300 dollar FEMA payments that Trump authorized by executive order. These ran out in various states throughout September. The New York Times had some good reporting on a study based on JP Morgan bank accounts that showed the median checking account of those receiving direct deposits of unemployment benefits rose significantly early on, and then fell off significantly in August. The fall off in savings is probably less dramatic for the under- and unbanked receiving prepaid debit card balances or checks, with consequently larger drop-offs in spending when supplementary payments expired. A New York Federal Reserve survey from June showed similar results for the early part of the pandemic.

>A similar story is told in the aggregate data. The saving rate peak coincided with the beginning of the stimulus check payments and supplemental unemployment benefits. As the stimulus checks were exhausted, the saving rate fell. It’s not possible to get a complete picture yet: we don’t have data for September, which will likely show larger declines. With the emergency FEMA payments declining, the desperation that has already racked millions of families is spreading — and so is the virus.


I am interested to see the September data on savings rate.
