I started 3 months ago with little to no knowledge, thinking I could start day trading and begin to grow my initial funds exponentially.

I opened up a Trading212 account and deposited £80.00. 

For the first month or so, I was day trading... Making multiple purchase and sell orders every day. I saw my balance grow to £90.00 at points and shrink to £70.00 at other points. During this time, I was learning about candle sticks and how to read graphs and how typical bullish/bearish markets looked like and became determined to become a day trader.

After many trades and probably being up by a few pence, I realised day trading wasn't where it's at and began to "invest" for longer periods of time. I invested in amazon, pfizer, square inc to name a few varying from a week to 2 months.

My investment strategy was working well, I was up by quite a few quid... Until I wasn't. I live in the UK and trade with GBP, but the stocks I was buying were US stocks using USD... The dollar (or pound?) dropped and negated the profit I was currently making on the increase in stock price, so I decided to sell everything and reevaluate my approach. (This is where I'm at currently).. I want to invest in UK companies with more knowledge/intention and hold for much, much longer than I have been.

Long story short, my balance now stands at £81.53. I have profited £1.53 during my 3 months of trial and error and learning through making mistakes.

I ask you lot, is this how any of your started? How can I improve myself? Share your experiences!

This doesn't make sense, as the stock has gone up slightly in the last few days.  Is there some reason for this I don't know?  Wanted to ask before contacting the bank and looking stupid.   I'm in the US._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My 8 investing guidelines. I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Draftkings strikes a gift card deal DraftKings gift cards will be available on stores like 7-Eleven, Speedway, Dollar General, and Sheetz, and also enable consumers to gift the DraftKings experience to others in $25 and $50 denominations.

The only one I sold shortly after was HYLN for a $60 loss. In the end I decided to avoid that ticker. I also had a position entered on NIO, which was another EV play.

My account hit $90k today. When I began these posts I think 6 weeks ago, I was only at $75k. Hopefully can continue moving on up with the same returns moving forward.

Due to the fact most my positions are still in the green of 20-30%. I foresee myself holding them until next week. It's also going to be the holidays so my trading will be light. I'll still make a short list of stocks this Sunday that I will be keeping an eye on though!

Positions from this week still open: **CODX, OSTK, U, WKHS, NIO**

I'm going to be looking to hold these for another 2-7 days and hopefully close them all out at +70% profit. We will see.

If you look at the NYT chart in particular, it's obvious that they've benefitted enormously from the reality-tv-as-news Trump presidency over the last four years. The stock was relatively flat at $12 from 2014 to 2016, then boom, Trump is elected and the stock quadruples to $50 in 4 years.

Politics aside, I think it's safe to assume that a Biden presidency will be boring in comparison to what we've just endured and, as a result, companies that profit on the spin cycle will miss earnings targets. This logic also applies to Twitter and possibly even Facebook (though my hope is that the platform will return to being friends-and-family focused).

Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint against Robinhood on Wednesday, accusing the popular trading app of failing to act in the best interests of its users.
  
The complaint cites Robinhood’s “aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors, its use of gamification strategies to manipulate customers, and its failure to prevent frequent outages and disruptions on its trading platform.”
  
The complaint is the first enforcement of Massachusetts’ Fiduciary Rule, which Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin began enforcing in September.
  
“Robinhood, which earns revenue for trades executed by its customers, gave customers with no investment experience the ability to make a potentially unlimited number of trades, without properly screening them to be approved for options trading,” a statement released in conjunction with the complaint reads. According to the regulator, 68% of Massachusetts-based Robinhood customers were approved for options trading after reporting limited or no investing experience.
  
“Treating this like a game and luring young and inexperienced customers to make more and more trades is not only unethical, but also falls far short of the standards we require in Massachusetts,” Galvin said in a statement.
  
“We have not seen the complaint, but we have and will continue to work closely and cooperatively with all of our regulators,” a Robinhood spokesman said in a statement to CNBC. “Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded. We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.″
  
Massachusetts’ complaint, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, follows a [reported investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/robinhood-is-reportedly-under-sec-investigation-could-pay-10-million-fine.html) in September.
  
Robinhood has pioneered the commission-free trading model since its founding in 2013, and has seen its user base explode amid the Covid pandemic. In the first four months of the year, the company said it saw a record 3 million new customers as stocks slipped into a bear market. The app has drawn much attention from Wall Street, and stock swings in popular names like Tesla have since been attributed to these new investors in the market.
  
Robinhood said it saw [4.3 million daily average revenue trades](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/17/robinhood-announces-another-mega-round-valuation-soars-to-11point2b.html) in June, [outperforming](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/robinhood-reports-more-monthly-trades-than-rivals-charles-schwab-e-trade-combined.html) all of the publicly traded, incumbent brokers. Robinhood’ said its DARTs more than doubled in the second quarter from the prior three months.
  
This year’s success has also brought growing pains. Robinhood has experienced several outages, including a multiday outage in March, leaving some clients unable to trade during a historic day for the markets.
  
In August, the company announced a Series G funding round of $200 million, boosting its valuation to $11.2 billion. Robinhood, which is widely expected to go public in 2021, has hired Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO preparations, according to Reuters, citing sources.

"Amazon tends to go through these heavy investment cycles. ... Whenever that happens investors get spooked and the multiple comes down, and then 12 to 18 months later, the investment stops, the profit spigot turns on and everyone gets blown away by the number," he said. "You buy it when they're investing heavily and when the stock is treading water."

Tepper calls it "reasonable" for Amazon to hit $4,000 by the end of 2021. It closed Tuesday just above $3,165.

"They've got the secret sauce in the streaming game. They've got the perfect blend of quantity and quality. I think Netflix has more pricing power than Disney. I think it goes a lot higher from here," said Tepper.

I figure joining the S&P 500 -> fraction of each share goes to Tesla -> Musk gets more big bucks to build new stuff with -> Everyone buys Tesla's new stuffs -> $TSLA shoots up in a few months.

Inevitably?) at times and I wondered if anyone out there does so too. I think its a viable strategy especially since I dont have any capital gains tax to worry about.

Examples of what I mean:

1. My $SE holdings shot up while my $AMD holdings took a beating that day, I trim a small portion of my SE and place it into $AMD. If my AMD went back up the next few days Id sell and put the money back into SE or any of my holdings that are beaten down that day. If it didnt I would just replenish my SE holding on the next month's deposit.

2. Selling off my initial long term $PLTR holdings because it shot up too much.

Im not quite sure what to call what im doing I may be wrong and this may just be simple portfolio optimisation.

Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

I’ve been wanting to dip into oil, but I don’t know much about the field. How does $SU look compared to others? I’m sure there’s a more “reliable” option, but I do believe this one has a chance of being pretty profitable. Thoughts?

People know that they are one of  the places where they can get a decent selection of games.  The website  is prime real estate in our transforming digital society.

There  are humorous videos of people flipping out in game stop because they  feel that they are being done dirty when they try to sell them last  year's Call of Duty and get offered 6 dollars.  However, this beats  nothing, which they will get if they download directly onto their  consoles and harbor a license in perpetuity.

What  I'm saying is that Game Stop has their name brand website that isn't  doing shabby.  Sales have increased 800 percent.  It's smart of them to  close down under-performing stores as they are no longer needed.  The  key thing is the website is able to generate sales at a fraction of the  cost of maintaining stores.

In my shitty opinion, it seems like everything is overvalued, except this stock.

As  of press time, game stop's total market cap is under a billion dollars  in a day and age where everything is worth billions of dollars

Personally,  I have a pretty speculative portfolio, and when I look at market caps,  it amazes me that the following companies are bigger than gamestops  paltry 900 million cap.

1. NIKOLA
2. MindMed valued at 1.2 billion yet is still traded OTC and is "not a going concern"
3. Like, all the SPACS
4. speculative pharmaceutical companies

For perspective, Here are some valuations for perspective

SNOW--93  billion, OKTA-33 billion, CRM-200 billion, MGNI-2 billion, ABNB -74  billion, snapchat 76 billion, TWLO lolz-50 billion, RXT-4 billion,  Wendy's 5.13 billion

**tl;dr**  What I'm saying is that name brand national recognition means  something, even if everybody hates you.  GME is an intellectual property  play as well. By this virtue, I sincerely believe gamestop should be a 6  billion dollar company at least with a serious price target of 69.42  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The S&P500 is an index made up of 500 large cap companies. This index makes up a large portion of the market (75%), so it is a tool to determine the overall market trend. Investing long-term in the S&P500 should yield steady returns. The average annual return is roughly around 10%. With reoccurring investments, your consistent contributions will ramp up your profit. Basically this long-term investment strategy is about dumping more and more money into $SPY in order to average down your shares. Eventually, 5,10,15+ years down the road, the profit will be insane. However, is this really an optimal strategy for maximizing gains? I absolutely love this manageable strategy nevertheless

This post will be pretty long, comparing a few financial figures and other things like that. Free to have any discussion on a few of the points I make, feel free to call out my logic or anything like that out! Skip to the end where it says "**Final Discussion"** if you don't want to read all my breakdown. 

&#x200B;

1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR)

2. Logitech International (LOGI)

3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF)

5. Plantronics (PLT)

&#x200B;

All numbers I post will be off of Yahoo Finance, so excuse me if some of the numbers are wrong. This is purely for discussion, hopefully it creates a good one!

**Revenue/Earnings/Growth**

Obviously a huge part of investing (at least for most people - haha), is to know if the company makes money or is on their way to making money; let us take a look. 

&#x200B;

1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Revenue* *= 1.1B, Earnings = -8M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 61%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 2294%*

2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Revenue* *= 2.98B, Earnings = +450M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 75%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 266%*

3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Revenue* *= 235M, Earnings = +18M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 141%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*

4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Revenue* *= 821M, Earnings = -84M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 25%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*

5. Plantronics (PLT); *Revenue* *= 1.7B, Earnings = -827M, QoQ Rev. Growth = -11%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*

&#x200B;

So a few things are clear from a fundamental revenue/earnings standpoint. The first being that CRSR, LOGI and HEAR are probably the best out of the five. Corsair has insane Earnings Growth, and are almost into positive earnings (remember I'm just using 2019 numbers). Logitech seem to be solid, with High Revenue and High Earnings Growth. Turtle Beach also seems to be growing at a quick pace. Razers small revenue growth QoQ scares me being paired with the negative earnings; unattractive. Plantonics  is losing a lot of money and their business seems to be slowing down. 

&#x200B;

**Institutional/Insiders Ownership**

I am always a big fan of insider ownership (up to a certain point), and even more so when there is high institutional ownership. I think big money always knows whats up, and maybe thats just being a sheep but lets take a look:

&#x200B;

1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Insider Ownership = 5.6%, Institutional Ownership = 91%*

2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Insider Ownership = 1%, Institutional Ownership = 58%*

3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Insider Ownership = 7%, Institutional Ownership = 66%*

4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Insider Ownership = 59%, Institutional Ownership = 3%*

5. Plantronics (PLT); *Insider Ownership = 2.3%, Institutional Ownership = 96%*

&#x200B;

So like I said above, I personally am a fan of both insider and institutional ownership. I like when Insider ownership is in the high single digits or low double digits (5%-12%?). This is because I feel like it gives companies leaders an incentive to work hard (as they own a considerable amount), while also not being able to override every decision a company makes, and instead allow external institutions and investors to have a voice as well. Obviously institutional ownership is good, big money generally means big things. So in terms of the statistics above; Corsair Gaming (in my opinion) has that great mix of insider ownership and lots of institutional ownership. The free float is very small (which may be why it is a very volatile stock). Razers high insider ownership and low institutional ownership scares me a lot, I would stay away from this company (to me thats alarming). 

&#x200B;

**Market Caps/PEG Ratios**

Market Caps just for reference on "how big" they are, along with the PEG Ratios. PEG Ratio is a metric thats not always used but it relates the price of the stock, the earnings-per-share (EPS) and EXPECTED growth. For anyone that doesn't know; 1 is assumed to be a fair value, between 0-1 is "undervalued" and above 1 is "overvalued". I am using PEG because we are comparing companies of significantly different sizes and earnings so it allows us to see if the individual companies are trading at a discount as per the earnings they are making. 

&#x200B;

1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Market Cap: 3.23B, PEG Ratio: 0.4*

2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Market Cap: 15.36B, PEG Ratio: 0.94*

3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Market Cap: 376M, PEG Ratio: 0.66*

4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Market Cap: 2.6B, PEG Ratio: N/A*

5. Plantronics (PLT); *Market Cap: 1.02B, PEG Ratio: 0.58*

&#x200B;

As we can see, Logitech is the largest one by far, with Turtle Beach being the smallest one. All of them appear "undervalued", perhaps this is the sector? From what I have seen in the Tech Industry it is pretty uncommon to have a PEG ratio between 0-1. As we can see this ratio is not to be taken too seriously, a company like Corsair Gaming has the best one, while Plantronics (despite the large losses in 2020) has the second best PEG Ratio. 

&#x200B;

**Cash/Debt/Current Ratio**

Shows the position the companies are in, the last metric we will look at. 

&#x200B;

1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Cash = 116M, Debt = 396M, Current Ratio = 1.41*

2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Cash = 917M, Debt = 35.9M, Current Ratio = 1.79*

3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Cash = 27.3M, Debt = 5.5M, Current Ratio = 1.72*

4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Cash = 594M, Debt = 11.8M, Current Ratio = 1.82*

5. Plantronics (PLT); *Cash = 228M, Debt = 1.7B, Current Ratio = 1.38*

&#x200B;

As we can see, all of the companies are positioned well to pay their short-term debt. Logitech, Turtle Beach and Razer are in fantastic cash positions, while Corsair is in a decent one; and Plantronics seems to be in a bad one. 

&#x200B;

**Final Discussion**

For anyone that is still here, I'll discuss some of the main points, along with my opinions. My bottom pick is Plantronics. The main reason is due to their negative growth, negative earnings & piling debt. My second least favourite is Razer. Although a great cash-to-debt position, Razers institutional ownership terrifies me; with a much lower growth rate compared to its peers I would say it explains the downwards slip since going public. 

&#x200B;

With the last 3 left to pick; HEAR? CRSR? LOGI? I think this is where I dive into more than just numbers. 

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach had an insanely high run-up back in 2013, but has struggled since. It is also the smallest of these three, and therefore I am personally the least interested. Turtle Beach is famous for their headsets, but the reality is they don't have much going on outside of that. Rocccat will boost their sales. Roccat have mice & keyboards, but in a crowded space that is very competitive they are definitely not the forerunners. Their business is, from a fundamentals stand point, not bad right now. But based on the scalability, Corsair and Logitech are my forerunners for this space (specifically peripherals) as I feel they have something more special. 

&#x200B;

Logitech has been on the market for over 20+ years, and has a pretty impressive growth story over the last 5 or so (\~600% return). Logitech is a household name; walk into an office and the mice are all Logitech. Keyboards, accessories, speakers; they do it all. Their growth has been very impressive, decent institutional ownership. Have a great cash-to-debt position, can pay short term debt. Logitech seems like a fairly sound investment. 

&#x200B;

Corsair Gaming has just recently IPO'd. It had a massive run-up and became a 'meme' stock. It has fallen 40% since then, and to me it seems pretty attractive right now. Corsair Gaming is a notorious brand in the true GAMING industry. Almost every single custom PC built for gaming will have Corsair parts in it. They have insane Earnings growth, are nearly profitable, have an excellent PEG ratio (explained above), and have excellent institutional ownership, paired with the good amount of insider ownership (explained above) as well. They can pay their short-term debt, and their cash-to-debt position doesn't scare me as they make over a billion in revenue per year now. 

&#x200B;

Now the MONEY - GOLDEN, question is : CRSR or LOGI? For me, I don't know. Corsair Gaming is 1/5 the Market Cap, and are making 1/3 the revenue. Logitech seems to be growing revenue at a slightly quicker rate than Corsair Gaming, but Corsair Gaming is growing earnings at a much quicker rate; and from a business and investor standpoint, earnings are more important. Logitech edges in peripherals, Corsair edges in custom computer parts. Corsair seems to be the Apple of this sector, while Logitech more like a budget product. The reason I say this is because PC Parts are more expensive than your average computer mouse. For me, a young investor, willing to take on a little more risk & volatility; a smaller company with higher earnings GROWTH is more attractive than a larger company with a slightly smaller one. The higher institutional ownership at the moment of IPO also makes me feel like many people are betting on their growth story. I feel like the possibility for stock price appreciation is higher with Corsair as opposed to Logitech, but maybe you have something to argue?

&#x200B;

I am open to any discussion, and I'm sorry for writing an absolute essay. I'm a gamer, I'm passionate about this sector. I think regardless of if you choose Logitech or Corsair, some money is to be made in the next few years. Thanks for reading everyone! Always do your own DD, as my findings are not to be responsible for anything you choose to do.

My mother inherited some stocks from my grandpa when he passed about 6 years ago. She has not touched them and has asked me to review her holdings and help her develop some sort of strategy. She does not need this money and has no intent of using it in her lifetime.

Her stocks are spread between 2 accounts and are as follows: 
* F - Approximately 27K USD (15k unrealized loss) 
* BLIAQ - 1.20 
* BAC - 14K (6.4K gain) 
* BYD - 20K (13k gain) 
* C - 5.5k (800 gain) 
* TMUS - 200 USD (100 gain)

I'm honestly pretty annoyed going through all of this. I am not sure if they are actively managing these accounts, but I would imagine not, considering she is so heavily invested in ford and has money in fucking blockbuster.

My investment strategy for myself is to usually dump everything in ETFs like SPY and QQQ then research individual companies and put a little money into the ones I like. Would it be wise to cash all of this money out and reinvest and diversify a bit? Like I said, she has no need or intent on using this money. If I understand correctly, her tax bill wouldn't be that big considering her overall net gain is low.

I've done well with Biotech when given firms to research but finding the small firms is the hard part and I haven't looked much on the past 2 years... if there are 1000 Biotech firms.... I spend a lot of time filtering out obvious junk and my investment pool is enough to go through about 25 to 30 stocks but just searching endlessly through Biotech is not.

I'd like to avoid Covid vaccines ones, most of them seem like they will just be a one off deal so unless they have something in the pipeline to be funded with one off covid money or potential like Novavax to be used as a yearly vaccine for years to come I don't see much genuine value._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TAN now the time to get in? It just keeps skyrocketing, is solar energy the next oil industry? Especially after who Biden picked for his cabnit. I’m seriously about to go all in on this solar etf + ENPH/other solar stock.

Looks super interesting_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help with last allocation of my portfolio So I’m assembling a retirement portfolio for the next 25 years of my life and I’m almost done. My goal is to get a 10% return, while accepting a lot of volatility. So far it is 35% VOO, 30% SCHB, 20% QQQ, 7.5% ARKK and 7.5%X. X is the part that I need help with. I was looking at small cap growth funds and I like JKK, but I’m not sure. Most of the small cap growth funds require expense ratios of 1.3% or more, and I don’t know if the fund managers will be there in 25 years. Anyone have any suggestions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SQ, AMD, NVDA room for growth in the future? I’ve been eyeing these for a long time and I haven’t pulled the trigger because I usually only invest in the medical sector. I have a few questions about these like specifically why did they soar so much after the pandemic crash especially Square? Especially with small businesses, bars, restaurants etc. being closed I felt like that would’ve hurt them but it seemed to have the opposite and I can’t figure out why. 
I also have the same thoughts for AMD and NVDA.

I was also wondering with them booming so much how much room for growth is there really left? Mainly because AMD and NVDA rose over 130% this year with square over 230%._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are Australian wine stocks worth looking further into? I'm extremely new to trading having only so far bought Vanguard ETF's and learning more every day. 

Here in Australia we are having a wine trade dispute with China. I can't say I follow news too closely but I drink a lot of wine haha. Upon further investigation I see Treasury Wineries stocks are down. 

Any opinions on whether or not Treasury Wineries would be worth keeping an eye on?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/16/2020 I use the RSI, Stochastic, MACD, and 10-50-200EMA Lines.

$AEYE: This beautiful channel also has a channel up inside of it, and it is currently at a support area. It has great steam and does well in the middle of the channel. Stoch is low and curling, and it is above all EMA lines.

$CRK: Great horizontal channel here, and an ascending channel. It finally broke the downtrend. Has massive room to run, especially if it breaks the 200EMA. 

$EXEL: Finally broke the downtrend and now at a support. If it breaks the 200EMA go long for sure. It can't really get much lower than this!

$GERN: Great channel up, and at a support area which I love. If it breaks the downtrend and goes long, it is gonna go crazy. Stoch is low and RSI is near 40.

$GIS: The volume line is acting as a support, and holds very well here. It has to break both EMA lines moving forward, but it is oversold and Stoch is also very low. 

$HZO: May be too late for today - but it is great moving forward. Let it pull back to the golden channel if ya want, but it certainly has room to run.

$NTES: This support has high success and is currently living. The Stoch and RSI are both low, it has both EMA lines to beat, but that is how swinging goes.

$PLNT: Potential trend line up here, it has a history of slightly breaking the 50EMA and coming back; and at support. Stoch is oversold.

$PTGX: Beautiful trend line at a support? Love it. Bullish Divergence on the Stoch, with it being oversold? Love it. Go long.

$YEXT: 70% volume line holding as a support, and it is a great value. RSI oversold and Stoch is very low as well. Has a history of bowl shaped reversals like this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NASDAQ up-lists? So yesterday I mentioned the possibility that CYBIN will soon qualify for Nasdaq, I did not mention they HaD applied just that they “could” potentially at anytime now, after which a few people pointed out that Drysdale filled for up-list yesterday on SEDAR. It doesn’t not say Nasdaq but it has to either be Nasdaq or TSX as they already said Frankfurt and OTCQB are filled... any document experts on here have an opinion??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Disney worth buying at the current price or is it worth waiting for a drop? Disney’s stock seems to be going through the roof with predictions that it will be at $250/share in the not too distant future. Is now a good time to buy or is it worth holding out for a drop in price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
