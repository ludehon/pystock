Legislation expands practitioners eligible for Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services

WASHINGTON, DC -- Representatives Mike Sherrill (NJ-11), Rep. David McKinley (WV-01), Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Rep. Denver Riggleman (VA-05), Rep. Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Rep. Andre Carson (IN-07), Rep. Glenn Thompson (PA-15), Rep. Andy Kim (NJ-03), Rep. Joseph Morelle (NY-25), Rep. Bobby Rush (IL-01), Rep. Albio Sires (NJ-08), Rep. Kevin Hern (OK-01), Rep. William Timmons (SC-04), and Rep. Paul Tonko (NY-20) introduced bipartisan legislation this week to increase access to telehealth services. The Expanded Telehealth Access Act expands the list of the providers eligible for Medicare reimbursement for providing care via telehealth. 

‚ÄúThe use of telehealth services during this crisis has demonstrated the critical role technology can play in improving health equity,‚Äù said Rep. Sherrill. ‚ÄúNo one should have to go without care when a video or phone conversation with a health care provider could mean quicker, safer medical attention.‚Äù

To reduce risks associated with visiting medical providers during the coronavirus pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded the types of health care providers who receive reimbursement for telehealth services. This legislation makes permanent the reimbursement eligibility for physical therapists, audiologists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists and permits the Secretary of Health and Human services to expand this list.

**‚ÄúEnsuring access to quality health care is more important now than ever. All too often people who live in rural communities in West Virginia don‚Äôt have access to the health care specialists they need,‚Äù said Rep. McKinley. ‚ÄúIt is crucial that such access via telehealth not end abruptly once the public health emergency ends.‚Äù**

According to the CDC, telehealth services have been particularly valuable for vulnerable populations, especially those with compromised immune systems or in rural areas far from a provider. The CDC also notes that expanded telehealth availability is likely to increase health equity. 

‚ÄúCOVID-19 has underscored the need to provide timely and reliable patient care through telehealth services,‚Äù said Rep. Riggleman. ‚ÄúI have been at the forefront of expanding telehealth during my time in Congress, and I am proud to be an original sponsor of this legislation that will expand access to telehealth services to rural and underserved communities. This bill will go a long way to remove barriers and bolster healthcare for both patients and providers.‚Äù

The Expanded Telehealth Access Act is supported by American Telehealth Association, the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASLHA), the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), the eHealth Initiative and Foundation, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, Inc. (HIMSS), and the Personal Connected Health Alliance (PCHAlliance). 

This summer, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) laid out specific **policy priorities to ensure Medicare beneficiaries continue to access telehealth services even when the COVID-19 pandemic ends**. **One of these priorities is to give the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand the list of providers eligible to offer telehealth to their patients.**

‚ÄúThis legislation removes unnecessary statutory barriers that restrict patients‚Äô access to care and empower patients and their providers to decide on the best care options,‚Äù said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO of ATA. ‚ÄúAs the only organization exclusively dedicated to the advancement of telehealth, the ATA commends Representatives Sherrill and McKinley for introducing the Expanded Telehealth Access Act.‚Äù

‚ÄúWaivers issued by CMS to allow occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the effectiveness of occupational therapy delivered through telehealth and the importance of removing barriers to care,‚Äù said AOTA President Wendy C. Hildenbrand, PhDP, MPH, OTR/L, FAOTA. ‚ÄúAOTA champions the bi-partisan efforts of Representatives Sherrill and McKinley to ensure that the provision of occupational therapy delivered via telehealth will remain an option for Medicare beneficiaries once the Public Health Emergency ends.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe use of telehealth during the pandemic has helped ensure patient access to physical therapist services, helped minimize potential exposure to the virus, and provided an option for therapy clinics and their patients,‚Äù said APTA President Sharon L Dunn, PT, PhD. ‚ÄúIt is critical for Congress to make this option permanent for Medicare patients. We applaud Rep. Sherrill for her leadership on this important bipartisan legislation with Rep. McKinley, and urge swift action on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPermanent telehealth access to medically necessary audiology and speech-language pathology services is critical for America‚Äôs seniors who live in rural and underserved areas, and especially during the nation‚Äôs public health emergency,‚Äù said Theresa H. Rodgers, MA, CCC-SLP, 2020 President of ASHA. ‚ÄúASHA thanks Representatives Mikie Sherrill and David McKinley for recognizing this critical need by introducing the Bipartisan Expanded Telehealth Access Act in the U.S. House of Representatives today. This bill will ensure Medicare beneficiaries permanent telehealth access to hearing, speech, language, swallowing, and cognition related health care services.‚Äù_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When are capital gains taxes paid on a sale of a stock and for reinvested dividends?

Also long PLTR_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Village Farms (VFF) Soaring - How high will it go? In the past couple of weeks we've seen VFF soar from around the $5 mark up to a current trading price of $7.40. A strong earnings showing excellent growth and profit (a rare occurrence in the pot industry) alongside the Biden victory has helped catapult the stock. The question is how high can it go?

If we look at the analysts price targets they average out around the mid teens of dollars with a couple of companies putting them in the twenties. This would suggest room for around 100% growth from the current SP.

So is this realistic?

VFF has long been plagued by shorts and for the past few months was trapped in terms of TA in a wedge. Having broken out of the wedge, I would suggest the technical analysis for VFF is much stronger in the medium term with a strong daily and perhaps weekly chart. As always being one of few Canadian weed companies to turn a profit also is a huge advantage.

But is TA enough to suggest VFF can get to double digits say before the EOY. No. VFF needs one of the catalysts it has saved up to be activated these are:

* Quebec License (December or January potential)
* A strong earnings next quarter including full PSF ownership
* Good news on US legalisation - VFF owns a huge area of greenhouses in Texas waiting to produce weed.
* Similarly progress on Mexican legalisation could benefit SP where they also own greenhouses.
* Even better PT upgrades from analysts.

I believe it is quite likely one of these will occur in the next three months leading to potentially a $3-$8 rise in SP. With the upper end most likely if US legalisation (or purely Texas) news is good as this would hugely increase the customer base.

For me the main risks is the high volatility of the stock and its relatively unknown name compared to the likes of Aurora, Tilray or the MSOs in the US. I think the worst case normal scenario would be down to resistances in the low $5s and in a market crash situation $4s. BUT this would be a huge buying opportunity.

This is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don‚Äôt think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don‚Äôt like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)

Before the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)

So, let‚Äôs talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer‚Äôs at over 94% and also doesn‚Äôt require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn‚Äôt rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn‚Äôt just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don‚Äôt see companies that don‚Äôt need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.

So in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don‚Äôt see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)

There are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)

This year is the second time that ETF‚Äôs have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)

Meanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)

As you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)

Tesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. 

And With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)

The stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)

One other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)

Also, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)

One other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)

The stock dropped considerably in the last 3 months, down almost a 60%, albeit the strengths of the company remain seemingly the same.

The main drawbacks are that the company reported losses in net income and adjusted EBITDA in the non-GAAP Q3. According to the company report, "net sales declined in Q3 2020 primarily attributable to lower clinical trial activity and allowances associated with U.S. sales". However, net sales for the first nine months of 2020 rose 19% from the same period last year, and the business fundamentals and cash position remain strong.

For these reasons, it seems to be an undervalued stock. My valuation uses historical ratios of EV/EBITDA of 40x, but it feels a bit too high to me.

Any ideas or feedback on this?

I am a 21 year old college student who has recently gotten into investing. (By recently, I mean really recently). This is because I think that investing is almost a necessity now for low-middle class families like mine to at least not worry about having to put food on the table every day. But this is not the point, and frankly I know almost nothing about investing, finance, the stock market, etc. 

I am doing my best to start out by reading books and studying some basic economic and finance fundamentals. But when it comes to investing itself, I don't know where to get advice from, and when I do, I don't know if the person giving me advice is talking out of his ass or is giving respectable advice.

I'm not asking about differentiating right and wrong, how could anyone predict correctly all the time. I'm also not asking anything about "what company is good to invest on" or anything naive like that. 

If I were to get advice on what factors I need to look out for to be a good investor, or what I should do and not do, or the psychological aspects of investing and stuff like that, I wouldn't know how to know what kind of stuff to filter.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Thank you :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CleanSpark sells software to Tesla and upcoming conference hype Hey everyone, straight to the point today since I'm sure everyone is high off the Tesla S&P hype and I think CLSK will be a great sympathy play by the time the TSLA/CLSK connection is publicly announced.

**What am I talking about?**

[Cleanspark](https://www.cleanspark.com/) (CLSK) is a software company focusing on microgrid controls, energy modeling, energy management and communication. Their software product line is as follows (SaaS):

*mVSO Platform:* Energy modeling software that can be used as a sales and design tool

*mPulse Platform:* Patented, proprietary platform that enables integration and optimization of multiple energy sources: Solar, Batteries, Generators

*Canvas:* Middleware used by Grid Operators and Aggregators to administrate load shifting programs.

*Plaid:* Middleware used by Controls and IoT Product Companies to participate in load shifting programs.

**CLSK has had** [**patents for it's software controls since 2018**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-receives-two-new-united-states-patents-300640187.html)**, and is a true leader in the field.** [**Labeled 'cutting edge,' by IBM.**](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/cleanspark-analytics)

CEO Zach Bradford on numerous occasions referred to future growth through [partnerships](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/926163/cleanspark-shares-jump-as-it-forges-exclusive-partnership-with-one-of-the-largest-energy-developers-in-costa-rica-926163.html), and through ['key market participants.'](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf)(slide 20) This is meant towards the EV industry as that is where the majority of market attention is. Tesla is quite a big fish in the EV sphere, and there is an EV connection by way of CLSK's subsidiary scoring two unnamed EV contracts, and by [two separate tesla-powered microgrids in costa rica](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-announces-microgrid-software-deployment-in-costa-rica-301121959.html). \[[The second one.](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/products-and-services-energy-industry-central-america-latin-america-and-caribbean-industrial-products-and-services-4594ac6145be63569e7fa89cf441a0c9)\]

While at first glance, it's a strange move to not name the EV companies you're working with, but if you can hold on to that announcement, knowing it'll raise the price, why not wait until you have more skin in the game? CLSK's SEC filings point super bullish as **on October 28th**, share payouts/incentives were approved and ALL officers loaded up.

Now this is excellent timing considering the biggest microgrid conference of the year-of which CLSK is a platinum sponsor-is this week, and facing an incoming progressive/green administration this conference is a big chance to get some much needed exposure to investors in this potentially MASSIVE upcoming industry. CLSK is in a phenomenal spot going into the microgrid conference this week, tons of cash on hand, nearly no debt, and acquisitions and employee growth (20-45) means this is a big send off point if everything goes well. That being said, Cleanspark can at any time announce it has everyone's favorite EV company (Sorry Nio) as it's primary SaaS client. The PR would be tremendous, and piggybacking off the S&P news might be what happens on thursday.

**How does this connect to Tesla?**

The Tesla-Cleanspark connection comes from Cleanspark's registered patents, and Tesla's employment of it's software features over the past year or so. Clsk has a hold on specific proprietary microgrid software, and I argue Tesla is a huge client.

Upon further examination of the uses of CLSK's SaaS programs, we find parallels in [multiple "Tesla Energy Software," programs](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-energy-software#softwarebenefits). According to them, Tesla 'devloped an advanced ecosystem of software,' which is a vague way to say they didn't make everything from the ground up. From Tesla's energy software support page:

>A common software platform powers the entire Tesla product ecosystem from Tesla‚Äôs largest storage product, [Megapack](https://www.tesla.com/megapack), to virtual power plants made up of thousands of Powerwalls. \*\*Beyond energy storage, Tesla software also supports solar, vehicle charging and non-Tesla assets required for operating microgrids and utility-scale power plants.\*\***1**  
\*\*Tesla‚Äôs suite of optimization software solutions, Autonomous Control, is composed of machine learning, forecasting, optimization and real-time control algorithms used for utility bill reduction, demand response participation, microgrid control and wholesale energy market bidding.\*\***2** Tesla Autonomous Control algorithms automate the dispatch of energy assets to maximize economic value. Autonomous Control products driving value to customers today include: Autobidder, Opticaster and Microgrid Controller. Tesla has also developed software to enable more renewable generation on the grid with features such as Virtual Machine Mode.

All of these things mpulse, plaid and canvas can do. **EV charging, vendor agnostic approach, etc.**

Then they list "Benefits of Tesla Software:"

>Tesla is the world‚Äôs only major vertically integrated energy storage provider. Unique seamless integration of hardware, firmware and software means industry-leading performance, reliability and over-the-air updates to deliver continued improvements and new features over time.  
Tesla software maximizes the value of our energy products and helps us effectively address a diverse customer base including:  
C&I Fleet Managers  
Project Developers (Commercial Solar, Microgrids)  
Aggregators  
Power Plant Operators  
Utilities  
Independent Power Producers  
Energy Market Traders

This parallels [Cleanspark's November 2020 IR presentation](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf) (refer to figures on slides 13&14), and it's explanation of both SaaS programs canvas and plaid fall directly in line with the fundamental goals of Tesla's 'software ecosystem.'

From the IR Presentation:

\[Canvas OpenADR VTN\]:

‚óè Used by Grid Operators and Aggregators to administrate load shifting programs

‚óè Implements a Virtual Top Node (VTN) on the server side of the OpenADR protocol

\[Plaid OpenADR VEN\]:

‚óè Client or product side of the OpenADR protocol

‚óè Used by controls and IoT product companies to participate in load shifting programs by providing a Virtual End Node (VEN)

Once again fairly vague, but all applicable to Tesla's software ecosystem goals.

Beyond this, Tesla's main [Powerhub](https://www.tesla.com/support/powerhub) software specifically, is described as:

>**Powerhub is an advanced monitoring and control platform for managing distributed energy resources, renewable power plants and microgrids.** Powerhub is deployed and in use across Tesla‚Äôs fleet of over one gigawatt-hour of operating commercial sites. Customers ranging from facility managers to power plant operators use Powerhub to maximize operational efficiency, uptime and asset value. Powerhub covers all common elements of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and offers standard customizations to meet the operational needs of small, large and virtual power plants.

Paralleling CLSK's primary purposes as per weekly [PR:](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-adds-former-zappos-counsel-and-a-new-vice-president-of-operations-301169857.html)

>"CleanSpark offers **software and intelligent controls for microgrid and distributed energy resource management systems and innovative strategy and design services**. The Company provides advanced energy software and control technology that allows energy users to obtain resiliency and **economic optimization**. Our software is uniquely capable of enabling a microgrid to be scaled to the user's specific needs and can be widely implemented across commercial, industrial, military, agricultural and municipal deployment. Our product and services consist of intelligent energy controls, microgrid modeling software, and innovation consulting services in design, technology, and business process methodologies to help transform and grow businesses.  
>  
>With Powerhub Tesla customers can manage many different energy assets including solar, storage **and select non-Tesla assets (generators, breakers, transformers) on a single interface**.

This is a bit abnormal for Tesla, to have a software that is **VENDOR AGNOSTIC**, [CLSK's wheelhouse in terms of it's limited competitive advantages over larger established competitors. (slide 10):](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf)

"mPulse Competitive Advantages: Vendor and Hardware Agnostic. We can connect and communicate with all energy products.

Patented Forecasting: Changes in renewable energy generation and facility power demands require nimble and responsive control, which mPulse provides "

>On top of providing data, Tesla says that customers can also use Powerhub to control their assets and perform tasks like:  
**Setting quiet hours for microgrid operation**  
**Configuring preferred set points for frequency/watt control**  
**Scheduling future dispatch for providing aggregate demand response**

Which are other features prominent in Cleansparks proprietary energy software technology.

There's much more to be said about CLSK in general, but this is my take on the information out there about tesla and clsk tech. I think this is a great time for CLSK and if the right news/partnership announcement this thing will take off. There's a green storm coming, and the people who can supply the industry leaders with the right tools are going to profit well, CLSK is leading the pack when supplying microgrid controls.

I read this article and I'm pretty curious about it. Could someone please briefly explain how I can invest on commodities futures - or is it even possible to do it by a novice investor..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Solar is going to be big, but I don't know what to do. So I am working at a solar installation company and I think that solar is not on everyone's radar, but it should be. I don't see a future where solar does not take over. I'd like some help seeing what I can do with this info. You can tell me I'm wrong. If there is something off with my reasoning, definitely point that out! But I'm mainly looking for how I should invest based off of this.  


1. It is actually green energy. The panels create enough energy to offset whatever emissions were used to make them. Secondly, it is easily recyclable and even if you toss them in the landfill, they aren't bad. Wind is not as green as it looks and kills birds and bats and it is hard to maintain and recycle. You just set and forget with solar.
2. Solar is CHEAP. Nearly the cheapest form of electricity. You don't have to build a giant nuclear power plant, you don't have to deal with all of the political implications of a nuclear power plant. It has recently become more cheap and it looks like it will continue to drop in price. Cheap = global use. Correct me if I'm wrong. Currently solar installers are making a KILLING. I work for a company that is not ripping people off and we are still extremely profitable. Other companies have almost double the price and are still cheaper than not going solar for their customers. I know this is not the case everywhere, but it is where I live.
3. Solid State Batteries are going to change the game. Once they make batteries that don't degrade (ETA 5-10 years), then solar farms will make MUCH more sense. A city will be able to be 100% solar and battery powered. There's hundreds of millions being spent on researching solid state batteries, mainly for cars, but IMO there is more potential for microgrids in developing countries.
4. Developing countries will have power! I think there is a lot of potential with solar to set up microgrids with batteries that will help push more people out of poverty and into A/C with Refrigeration. EVs and Battery powered machines will make things like automated farming and things like that boom. Especially if Tesla's Starlink becomes more affordable, I could see huge GDP growth in many countries that haven't had great access to power or internet.

So currently, I see a lot of potential for solar installers and manufacturers, I see potential for Solid State Battery producers (a lot harder to guess who will come out on top at this point), I see potential for A/C and refrigeration globally, I see potential in booming GDPs (but more like in 20-30 years).  


So! Feel free to poke holes in my way of thinking, or feel free to brainstorm the best way to use this way of thinking. Also if you have any questions about my experiences with solar, then I can try to answer some of them. I'm not a super expert, but I do have more perspective than your average person._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do I get fast notification of major stock news like the Tesla one today?

Highlights:

* Outlook for the future.  

"Big picture, our outlook is based on three unassailable facts. First, global energy demand will rise in the next two decades, driven by population growth, an increase in middle class and urbanization.

Developing countries by themselves will need at least 35% more energy. And we think North America has a great opportunity to increase global market share of supply simply because we have the best resources, technology, infrastructure and environmental standards. Second, the return of economic growth will depend on affordable and reliable energy. That's always been the case over history and won't change.

And third, no matter what future demand looks like or what kind of energy we're talking about, we need existing infrastructure, replacements and newbuild. It's also true, though, that we're transitioning to a lower carbon-intensive economy. You can see that in the fundamentals as well, and we all know the reasons for it. But it's clear to us that the energy transition will be gradual."

* Stock buybacks moving up in the ladder. 

"Basically, the traditional longer-term payback organic projects are going to have to compete just as they always have with buybacks. And certainly, at this price, that's going to be a tougher threshold for them to beat. So that's how we'd look at it.

I think post 2021, I think it's going to be a race, if you will, between buybacks and our traditional alternatives. But certainly, buybacks has moved up."

* Capital allocation (and their secured growth program). 

"We continue to remain focused on preserving our financial strength. Our credit rating continues to be among the best in the industry. DBRS and Moody's both reaffirm their ratings outlook during the third quarter.

We expect full-year leverage to be well within our target range of 4.5 to under five times debt to EBITDA, which range itself is well within BBB+ territory. Our counterparty credit performance has also been strong despite current market conditions. In addition, our 2025 funding plan is complete, and we've pre-funded a portion of 2021. 

... Along with our base business, the secured capital projects we're executing on are going to generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow once fully in service. And combined with the debt capacity generated by that EBITDA, we anticipate $5 billion to $6 billion of annual financial capacity to reinvest. Now over time, we've maintained a very disciplined organic and risk-adjusted-returns-based approach that's created a lot of value for shareholders, and we aren't going to deviate from that recipe or our low-risk business model.

Our first capital allocation priority, of course, is to preserve our financial strength. We've worked our leverage levels down through good execution, simplification and noncore asset sales, and we'll maintain this robust position. Second, we'll continue to prioritize sustainably returning capital to shareholders through dividends. Our dividend is central to our investor proposition, and we intend to grow the dividend annually.

And we've always targeted the midpoint of our 60% to 70% payout range over time. Thirdly, we'll continue to grow cash flows organically. 

... It's pretty clear that our 2021 priority is completing our secured growth program, which will generate over $2 billion of incremental cash flows. So you can see the marginal economics on that completion capital is powerful and compelling. For new capital deployment, we'll prioritize regulated rate base additions in our gas transmission and utility businesses, which are uniquely positioned to do so. In addition, we'll place continued emphasis across our business on efficient growth opportunities that generate outsized returns with limited capital.

A good example of this is our Liquids Mainline capacity optimizations over the last few years. These in-franchise in-corridor, smaller executable projects come with a much shorter payback period, which is great. And of course, cash flows will be further enhanced by our embedded growth, cost reductions, total escalators and the like, and of course, those require zero capital. So of our $5 billion to $6 billion of annual financial capacity, this initial high-graded allocation of capital will ratably use up constantly about 2/3 or $3 billion to $4 billion, which is going to leave us about $2 billion to $3 billion of capacity to consider other capital deployment options.

In terms of how we use that capacity, clearly, at share prices we see today, share repurchases have moved up the preference order."

* ESG

"ESG has been part of how we've operated this business for a very long time. This isn't our first rodeo at ESG. We've set and met targets in the past. And the way we look at ESG is really as an enabler of our operations and our ability to execute strategy.

So not a nice-to-have, but a must-do, and we believe this is a differentiator. The new targets are about getting even better. We spent about a year thinking about that and devising a plan to achieve those targets. So in the next slide, on the E, we're setting an interim emissions intensity reduction target of 35% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050.

Those cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our business. And although the midstream business today overall in our industry accounts for about 2% of the energy value chain, we're going to be tracking performance against Scope 3 as well to reflect our investments in low-carbon infrastructure that we mentioned. On the S, we're increasing our diversity goals, including 40% gender representation and 28% ethnic and racial groups. And that extends to the G, for the Board level, to 40% on gender and 20% on ethnic and racial.

And to ensure we have good alignment, we're linking these to executive compensation. The next slide briefly captures our four pathways. First, modernizing equipment and applying technology to tackle emissions and reduce consumption using lower carbon sources of fuel for our pumps and compressors. Self-powering were solar in both liquids and gas, as you saw earlier in the examples, and we'll continue to invest in nature-based assets."

You're it and no tag backs. I decided to watch *The Social Dilemma* documentary on Netflix, which is not to be confused with that movie about Facebook, despite the producers' clear intent to directly mimic its mood. The Social Dilemma is an eye-opening (but also eye-rolling over-dramatic) documentary about our reliance upon and identity in social media. The film communicates the dangers of our complete reliance upon and misplaced identify in social media, touching on the loss of personal qualities and social skills, lack of favorable experiences over one's lifetime and more, but that's a discussion for another sub. 

What I found most interesting, and really no secret to anyone, is that data is king of this age. Well, not necessarily *raw* data, but rather, the inferences that can be made from data. And of course, having/owning the data, or at least influencing its flow, makes it all possible. The film quoted a common saying when speaking about our use of social media:

>*if you aren't paying,* ***you*** *are the product*

Many of us spend hours (in what could amount to be years over a lifetime), jumping from **free** social media platform to platform while our personal data and behaviors are documented and often analyzed, becoming valuable **products** for which to monetize and even govern. Again, this isn't news to anyone old enough to accept the terms of service, but it did prompt me to do a quick Google search for "social media login pages." 

The majority of the image results all look something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/6if6Vqe.png). 

Almost every popular social media platform offers a login option from at least two of the companies shown: Google and Facebook. Many offer a lot more. I've seen many different investment philosophies and touted tickers on this sub, but I feel like social media has served this one up to us on the most polished silver platter imaginable, reinforcing what we already know. It's right in our faces and requires neither investment experience nor in-depth analysis. They've done that for us. 

Investing in these companies that collect our data and determine its flow; companies in which you *entrust* your identity (**T**witter, **A**mazon, **G**oogle, **M**icrosoft, **F**acebook) is an easy "set it and forget it" approach to long-term investing, and one of the only ways I can think of for an individual to potentially profit off their own personal data. I'd like to think of the returns and dividends from shares in these companies as a subscription model *you* can charge them to access your personal data. 

I saw a post on here several months ago, talking about yearly performances of the top 3 or 4 most valuable U.S. companies vs the market average. I was honestly shocked at how often and consistently, their returns beat the market average. I wish I had the link and I don't want to relay false info, but I think it was more than 75% of the time, they outperformed the market. Not only are these companies currently the most valuable in the U.S. (except Twitter), but they are gatekeepers that direct the flow of all personal and public, present and future data.

While Twitter is ironically struggling with its social identity and sentiment shows that, we just saw Twitter censor, in real time, the leader of the free world's most efficient and widespread method of communication in the history of mankind. It takes less than 24hr for something trending on Twitter to result in the loss of a job, a fully-funded charity case, or a positive ID and real time location of someone in the background of a photo taken the day before, and it's all done by it's users rather than employees. So I'm keeping them in with the belief that their influence far outweighs the cost of their entry point. 

Considering all of this, and working with the belief that A) data is king of this age, B) reliance upon social media is ever-increasing, and C) most social platforms, current and in development, entrust the validity of your ID to these few companies, investing in the TAG MF etf is a decent, stress-free investment for the **average** investor who doesn't want to look at numbers.

Obviously, there will always be better performing stocks and sectors day to day, year to year, a few things could disrupt investment in top tech companies, but until tech and all other sectors stop integrating with services from these companies, I'm in without thinking twice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain Biden's tax plan and how it affects earnings from the market? So like many of you, I am new to the stock market. I know Biden has some pretty aggressive tax plans and I have been given advice I don't really know what to think of. I was told to sell off my stocks and cash out prior to Trump getting out of office, and then buy back in after the new tax plans have been introduced.

Airbnb on Monday [released¬†its prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)¬†to debut on public markets. The company allows users to book short-term rentals and experiences while traveling.

The company made $219 million in net income on revenues of $1.34 billion last quarter. That was down nearly 19% from $1.65 billion in revenue a year prior. Despite primarily turning net losses, the company has had other occasional quarters of profitability, including the second and third quarters of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019.

The company said it plans to trade under the symbol ‚ÄúABNB‚Äù on the Nasdaq.

In its prospectus, the company put an emphasis on building a community around its hosts and guests, positioning that community as a differentiating factor from its competitors. The company said it would set up 9.2 million shares of non-voting stock aside in an endowment fund for hosts.

‚ÄúOur guests are not transactions -- they are engaged, contributing members of our community,‚Äù the company said in its prospectus summary. ‚ÄúOnce they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb to others who then join themselves. This demand encourages new hosts to join, which in turn attracts even more guests. It is a virtuous cycle -- guests attract hosts, and hosts attract guests.‚Äù

In 2019, the company reported a net loss of $674 million on revenues of $4.81 billion. Thus far in 2020, the company has turned a net loss of nearly $697 million on revenues of $2.52 billion. The decline is likely from the impact of the coronavirus, which put the brakes on leisure and business travel earlier this year.

## A quick bounceback from the pandemic

Airbnb has endured a tough 2020. As the coronavirus decimated travel around the world, the company [raised $2 billion in new debt funding](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/airbnb-raises-another-1-billion-in-debt.html) at a valuation of $18 billion and announced major cost-cutting initiatives, including plans to [lay off 25% of its staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/airbnb-to-lay-off-nearly-1900-people-25percent-of-company.html), or nearly 1,900 employees. The company also slashed marketing costs and raised billions of dollars in debt.

The coronavirus pandemic brought the travel industry to a halt, resulting in an estimated $443 billion of lost revenue since the beginning of March,¬†according to¬†[a Nov. 5 report](https://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/media_root/document/Coronavirus_WeeklyImpacts_11.5.20.pdf?utm_source=MagnetMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=11%2E5%2E20%20%2D%20COVID%20Research%20Weekly&amp;utm_campaign=ust)¬†from the U.S. Travel Association.

Airbnb rebounded, however, after¬†[a surge of rentals in rural areas](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/rural-airbnb-bookings-are-surging-as-vacationers-look-to-escape-the-coronavirus.html)¬†as residents with means fled pandemic-stricken cities.¬†The rebound began within two months of the pandemic, the company said in its prospectus.

‚ÄúIn early 2020, as¬†Covid-19¬†disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb‚Äôs business declined significantly,‚Äù the company wrote. ‚ÄúBut within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became¬†work-from-any-home¬†on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling.‚Äù

Airbnb said its number of listings has declined and may continue to decline in part due to the pandemic. In particular, some people rely on Airbnb to help pay living expenses or mortgages, and those people may get knocked off the platform.

‚ÄúIt is not yet clear what financial impact the severe travel reduction occurring during the¬†Covid-19¬†pandemic will have on these individuals or whether they will be able to keep their homes or operate their businesses as travel resumes,‚Äù the company wrote in its risk factors. ‚ÄúOur business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if our hosts are unable to return to normal operations in the near to immediate term.‚Äù

Unusually, the company has a Stakeholder Committee on its board of directors whose mission is to consider interests of ‚Äúkey stakeholders,‚Äù including guests, hosts, communities and employees. The notion of ‚Äú[stakeholder capitalism](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/salesforces-marc-benioff-claims-a-victory-for-stakeholder-capitalism.html)‚Äù envisions a departure from traditional business practices which put shareholder interests first, and instead sees business as serving many groups.

Airbnb endured numerous issues with its hosts this year since enforcing an extenuating circumstances policy in March that overrode hosts‚Äô cancellation policies and claimed to offer full refunds to guests impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.¬†

Later, Airbnb announced it would establish a $250 million coronavirus relief fund for hosts, returning 25% of what they would have normally received under their cancellation policies, but [many hosts who spoke with CNBC complained](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/airbnb-hosts-getting-almost-nothing-from-250-million-relief-fund.html) that they were not receiving the correct amounts or any payments at all.¬†

In November, the company was [hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/airbnb-hit-with-proposed-class-action-lawsuit-from-host-missing-payments.html) by one of its hosts, alleging that the tech company violated its contract with hosts when it enforced the extenuating circumstances policy.¬†

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividend Portfolio (Tales of the "Dividend guy") So this is my first post on the subreddit but I have been a member for a few months now. I sort of stay on the side and read everyone else's posts and try to get some ideas. I actually just started investing back in September, and I have been slowly learning the ins and outs of investing. I see a lot of posts about stocks and their values and a lot of useful information but one topic I don't see come up often is dividends (maybe there are tons of posts and I am just missing them all). I see people get excited about jumps in prices but not dividend payout dates. Before I ask my question I want to just give a short story of this guy I know. I call him the "Dividend guy", mostly to protect his identity.

&#x200B;

So about a year ago, I started thinking of my future at 21 years old, and I met this guy at work who is about 5 years older than me. I saw him one day looking at stocks on his computer and I sparked up a conversation with him telling him how I am trying to get into investing for my future. He gave me some tips and it seemed to be a common interest we shared so every time we saw each other we brought it up.  This guy has been investing since he was 18, and he was telling me about some of the stocks he owns. However, one thing I noticed was that after every stock name he told me he also told me the dividend yield % which was impressive he knew them offhand. Fast forward to yesterday and we sat down at the lunch table and he wanted to show me something, he gave a huge talk about why he loved dividends and then showed me a picture of his portfolio. More specifically it was the last 3 stocks that paid him dividends and I was kind of shocked.  One was a payout of around $300 CAD dollars for AT&T dividends, another was around $250 CAD for oracle dividend payouts, finally around $75 dollars CAD for apple dividends, total that up, and within a few days, he made $650 dollars. Also, that's apparently quarterly payments so he gets around $650 dollars every 3 months or so (if that's how it works). I was impressed but then he told me his and plan and this plan is what got me to write this post. He told me he puts all the money he makes from dividends back into purchasing more stocks for now (I know people do this and I do the same). However, he told me his goal is to earn enough money from quarterly dividends and retire by the time he is in his 40's eventually he wants to have enough money coming from dividends to retire and just live his life off of dividend payments. He told me he would need somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000 CAD coming in quarterly for him to meet his goal.

Now, this got me thinking, I thought this was a cool idea, however, I wanted some opinions from people who know more than me. Is this guy's thinking normal or not normal? I have never heard of someone banking this much off of dividend payments. I mean I just got my first dividend payments from Apple and I made around 6 dollars CAD from 24 shares. I can see taking the hundreds of dollars you can make from dividends and putting back into your portfolio but not living off of them.  But I am worried I am too new to investing to be questioning anybody's methods. So I would love to get some opinions and see if maybe this is a strategy I should look into for the longterm.

There. I said it. 

If I was to tell you the type of trader I am, I'd say I'm in year one (started with a small sum in March 2020, which has grown since). I'm still pretty emotional about my trades and my strategy has changed completely since the beginning. 

I now invest more in stocks that I consider high growth. I'm learning how to research companies properly and keep a keen eye on news and commentary too. I use Trading 212.

My problem (or, rather, one of them) is that I'm crap at maths. I find it incredibly complicated. Feel free to judge, I know a lot of the people here are completely clear on the science underpinning their portfolios and would argue that what I'm currently doing is essentially gambling. To them, I say we all have to start somewhere. 

Currently, my numbers are, deposits: ¬£15,331 live result: ¬£2,008, total value: ¬£17,339.

I can work out a  performance for the last 8 months. And that's where my ability to gain insight ends. 

I can promise you I've read REAMS of information but I just look at my trades and become incredibly lost. I struggle to hold calculations and methods in my head and always have. That's due to memory and focus inabilities. 

So my questions are these: 

\- is there a simple way to get my head around the basics;

\- will I be hamstrung by my inability to do the maths

\- and, do I really need to know it's performance beyond the metrics my portfolio gives me (the % gain/loss of each position)

Or shall I just piss off and stop bugging the grownups..?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV stock upgrades 11/16/2020: $LI, $XPEV dramatically boosted to new target prices ($LI to $45.60, $XPEV to $57.71) by Citigroup EV stocks $LI & $XPEV were dramatically boosted to new target prices ($LI to $45.60, $XPEV to $57.71) by Citigroup's Jeff Chung on Monday.

> In boosting his target price, Chung appears to have become more optimistic about fourth-quarter and 2021 EV sales in China. His new target values Li at roughly 15 times estimated 2021 sales. Tesla (TSLA), for comparison, is trading for about eight times estimated 2021 sales.

> Li is growing faster than Tesla, off a small base of vehicle sales, but the Chinese EV valuation multiples don‚Äôt have any precedent. Li and its peer Xpeng (XPEV) became publicly traded companies in the summer.

> Chung also took his Xpeng price target to $57.71 from $34.70. He already rated Xpeng stock Buy coming into Monday. The new price target values Xpeng at more than 20 times estimated 2021 sales._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Portfolio Organization - Stable to Growth? Hi all, I'm posting here because I'd quite like some advice.

Around a quarter of my portfolio is in some (relatively) safe, steady stocks - MSFT, DIS, GOOG, AAPL & AMZN.
Whilst they've served me well for a long time, I'm left wondering how much growth they truly have to give. At the end of the day, investing is a numbers game, and I feel like more numbers may be gained elsewhere. I'm in my early twenties, by the way, and been investing since I was about ten (I know right).
Which, if any, do you believe could be cut from my portfolio in favour of stocks with more growth potential? Which stocks might those be, if you have any recommendations?
I'm thinking of reallocating more into ICLN, SBE, maybe a little DKNG or CRNC.
I'd appreciate any and all viewpoints!
Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
