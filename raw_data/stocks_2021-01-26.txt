After years of focus on alpha generation in the product. This makes you competitive in defense and industry. 

“We are an operating system for the modern enterprise.” What actions should insights drive?

One of the biggest investment areas over the past few years has been modulation. Proud ourselves on end to end solutions. We learned how the conventional architecture broke down or didn’t work. This became encoded in the product. But customers had to take everything. Now, they can pick what they need only and build on that. 


Foundry
Bianca rahill-marier product leader everything above ontology

Central decision support framework. 

Ontology and simulation engine: preserve local governance. Data from across organization maps to objects/categories which can flow from and back into enterprise apps/solutions. Example: identify surplus of raw materialism supply chain flagged and notify sales of the opportunity. The ontology and resulting actions train the engine/models which allow simulation or “what-if” scenarios. Can be based on AI or simple logic or both. Models are bound to real world inputs and outputs. As well models can be bound together in a chained scenario providing the ability to understand the impacts of real world situations to the entire supply chain. Ie. you can test market impacting decisions not just for your part of the supply chain but all the way to the consumer. 
What took months now takes hours:
Data integration: takes raw data from many systems, joins and featurizes. User defined and inferred table relationships are created. 
Use case catalog: templates for common industry use cases. Provide a foundation of the hard stuff and flex within the framework. 
Roadmap:
Reach more customers through use case catalog
Modularity: 
Interoperability with data platforms or build 3rd party apps on top of foundry as a data platform
Reach more users: new mobile offering and collaboration solutions
Mobile app for field workers to be given task plan prioritized and based on broad data inputs
Shared spaced with foundry for purpose built efforts. Highly controlled permissions. 
Build on AI applied to operations:
Digital twin: provide dev ops for applying and creating purpose built models that can be quickly deployed
Simulation engine: chained models to ask what if scenarios’ impact on the entire supply chain

While the author posits some reasons that it might not happen, just simply try to search for a multi-room vacation rental for a small group of people on [Expedia.com](https://Expedia.com). It's hard. It's terrible. It's several years in the making. That's an opportunity for Expedia to fix, or it's a defining decision point to move on and spin it off. 

Expedia's data, vernacular, UI, and ethos is still all hotels - even after spending years working to make VRBO a dominant driver of revenue within the Expedia ecosystem. That demand gen has never materialized, and their UI speaks volumes of how far they have to go.

My personal opinion, is that with the inevitable growth in the online sports betting market, will also come even stronger competition from betting platforms outside of DraftKings with the possibility that DK may even take the backseat so although some of the holdings BETZ has right now may seem pointless, they’ll be strong competitors by the time this market takes full shape. Does this seem like the correct thinking?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ERJ/Embraer is DFV, and has long term multiplicative potential. DD inside. Will post sources in the comments.

***What is Embraer ($ERJ) and What Do They Do?***

Embraer is a jet making company located in South America, specifically in Brazil. The difference between "jets" and "planes" is jets use gas discharge instead of propellers in order to move the aircraft. This allows them to fly faster, and at higher altitudes. (1)

ERJ is the third largest producer of civil aircraft. Embraer sells jets to many different airlines, as well as business and executive jets to corporate companies. They are also involved in the production of military and agricultural aircraft.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***The Value Thesis Behind Embraer***

Embraer currently trades around $6.40/share. Pre-pandemic, they were trading around $20 alone. This by itself represents a 200% upside. It was trading at it's highest levels at $52.80 in 2008.

In 2017, Boeing confirmed rumors that it planned to buy out Embraer. This deal fell apart in April, likely due to the financial strain that the pandemic caused Boeing.

A part of the stock's failure to recover in stock price is likely due to the cancelled plans of acquisition by Boeing. Since then, Embraer has stated that it will move forward without Boeing. (2)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Investing Thesis***

Here's why I believe the market forecasts will show that the partnership with Boeing will not matter.

*--Financials---*

* Embraer has a strong orders backlog of 15.1 billion dollars, with *zero* cancellations as of Q3 2020.
* Improved net revenues since Q1 (18%).
* Decreased expenses of 30% from Q1-Q3.
* 2.18 billion dollars in free cash, with liquidity similar to pre-pandemic levels.
* 90% of debt is long term - they are also backed by the Brazilian government

\--Travel--

* A faster than expected recovery for air travel is expected in 2021 (3)
* While travel is expected to improve, I believe that many airlines will have trouble booking out all of their seats while the pandemic travel fear effect lingers.  

   * In this case, Jets make more sense in order to improve cost margins for airlines.
* Jet travel is safer, both in relationship to COVID-19 as well as physical safety (4)  

   * With recent bad press around large plane crashes and consumer fears (irrational, or otherwise), this is likely to benefit Embraer.

\--Future Travel (EVtols)

* Incorporating alternative fuels into aircraft, namely electricity, are most feasible in jets due to the size and weight differences between large aircraft and jets.
* Embraer is currently working on designing EVtols
* Consumer interest in investing in as well as being involved in green energy and alternatives is likely to continue, especially under the current administration (5)
* Aircraft contribute 12% to carbon emissions in the United States (6)  

   * Aviation emissions have quadrupled since 1966 (7)

 I work at openreach in the UK, I started as an engineer and I now work in a role which manages the roll out of FTTP nationwide.

Why is nobody talking about Huawei being banned due to security concerns. 

THIS has led to Nokia becoming nearly the sole provider for equipment which will end up in millions of homes, FORGIVE ME FOR COPYING THIS DD BUT I WANTED TO TEST IT OUT of exchanges and street cabinets. Nokia in the UK alone will be a name which ends up in millions upon millions of homes again when they all end up having their GPON 1+1 ONTS installed in as copper networks are phased out.

Nearly all new build properties like the major majority is having this stuff installed because openreach offer it to DON’T GIVE A SINGLE AWARD TO THIS POST with like more than 10 homes for free but we still have to buy the equipment from Nokia lol that isn't free. 

The homes which aren't new build, so the majority of the “THE MARKET MANIPULATORS ARE HERE” built in sections to the underground boxes/poles outside of homes, after an area of let's say 40,000 homes is built, the copper network has a timer set and when that runs out people will be forcefully migrated onto the new FTTP network. This won't be a choice! Every home will need new Nokia equipment as mentioned above (ONT) which is like a router but its the termination point for fibre. Fibre will not work without them. 

We are the biggest telecom infrastructure builder in the UK with the biggest FTTP footprint which is also the fastest growing footprint. Nokia will once again be found in millions of UK homes with their branded onts. 
We do have competitors like virgin who are shite, and other competitors like hyper optic and city fibre. But they are targeting different criteria, where as Openreach is EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE. 

If you want to discuss Nokia, remember the above, FTTP is Huge for them, all I see anybody mentioning is 5g lol. I don't know much about that. But I do know they are being cemented into the network which will be used for over 100 years. Again I can only speak for the UK

ALL EXCHANGES owned by the BT group (parent company for openreach) are also installing and using Nokia head end OLTs which is where the fibre starts, Nokia hydra cables to connect OLT to ODF. Nokia SFP inside the OLT. This equipment is a big deal, and its fucking expensive.

Street cabinets FTTC and FTTC with gfast pods will become Nokia too as Huawei equipment is retired and replaced in the future. These are on nearly every street corner UK wide and will be replaced by Nokia equipment if they are not overlapped by FTTP which is being built using Nokia equipment anyway

I bought £400 in Nokia yesterday, sorry if this is seen as a pump. Its not. But if people want to pump Nokia, please can you at least include this DD which is a fucking gigantic piece of information nobody is discussing

TLDR- HUAWEI was banned in more places than just the USA. UK also banned due to security. Nokia is now providing equipment which is building the majority of elements from exchange end to customer end of the FTTP journey for millions of homes across the UK.

Smaller cap and midcap Tech companies are super deedooper undervalued. That’s why I’ve been buying and holding them since March. They are going to blast off to the fucking Moon like bigcap XLK did from 2009-2020.
It only takes 10% of the market cap of the XLK holdings to rotate into these etfs to make them go up 400% over the next 5 years. Or these get bought up at way higher prices by the bigcaps like how Facebook bought 80 small companies in the last few years “and nobody noticed”. And throw in some XLK and TDIV for bigcap tech to balance yourself and get fatoldcap tech sweetass divis to toss into more small cap tech etfs!

MOON - a new etf only 2 months old but from Direxion who have been running the popular 3x leveraged etfs since 2008. This is my best performing etf this month!! The index this etf tracks has been around for years. Check the SP indexes site its called S&P Kensho Moonshots Index, disruptive and innovative companies only in this index. 

IRBO, XT, KOMP, BOTZ, ROBT, QQQJ, ARKQ, ARKK, ARKW, PRNT, FTXR, IDRV, DRIV, HAIL

And dont forget sweet MaryJane is a wonderful medicine for all of us and will one day be legalized. Spread some increasingly worthless US Dollars into these 5 solid Cannabis etfs
MSOS, YOLO, MJ, CNBS, POTX

Toss in 20% to smaller Aerospace companies 
XAR, ROKT, and ITA for some bigcap Aerospace because were going to meet the aliens soon oh yeah!! And Space is the future duh!! And its cool as fuck!! ...awesome guitar solo........!!!!!!

Toss in 20% to Clean Energy including the big clean energy global utilities part of the Infrastructure etfs
ICLN, QCLN, PBW, CNRG, FAN, TAN, IGF, NFRA, IFRA, PAVE

Please excuse me if this is a dumb question. I've tried searching on reddit and google but they dont answer my question. 

I am learning about the different kinds of investing, and right now I'm looking at day trading. Given the PDT rules, if your account has less than $25,000 then you only have three day trades per 5 rolling trade days. However, if you have a cash account then the PDT rules dont apply. 

It seems to me that the only disadvantage of having a cash account is not being able to use borrowed money. If I understand correctly, while you're waiting for the money to be transferred from your bank to the broker, a margin account lets you borrow the money so you can use it right away. This can be beneficial if there is a sudden move you want to do and you dont have enough buying power within the broker. 

But with a cash account, if you dont have the money available within the broker, you cant really do anything but wait 3-5 days for the money to be transferred. So knowing this, if your strategy is to only use 50% of your portfolio for active trading, then you're not missing out by not having access to margins. Is this correct?

Looking at it objectively, it seems like a cash account is "safer" for beginner traders because it prevents impulsive deposits and trading. By forcing someone to stick to a specific dollar amount or making them wait up to 5 days it can circumvent emotionally driven actions. I suppose this makes sense then if your account has to have $25,000 to be able to use margins as a PDT because with that portfolio you are likely not a beginner anymore and wont make as much impulsive trades. 

Is my understanding correct? Is there something I am missing about the disadvantages of a cash account compared to a margin account?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Earnings Season, Beats and by How Much I recall a post in the last few days lamenting the fact that there is not an easy source during earnings for companies reporting, those that beat estimates and by how much.

I purchased some shares at $12.48, and since then the stock doubled up until recently when the company forewarned about Q1s earnings despite beating Q4 expectations. It’s currently trading at around $18.90.

I’m wondering if this stock has potential to grow a bit more.

I didnt want to wake up to buy, so I set a limit buy at $21 max, hoping to snag my 50 shares at $20. Now I have been under the impression that limit buy will purchase at market open unless it goes over the limit. Market opened at $18, eventually went up to $20 and back down to $18. It automatically bought all my shares at $21 a share, which the stock has never hit, not even in a 52 week high. How did I end up buy 50 shares of a stock at a higher price than the 52 week high??

Is an EV company in the United States. Has the ex-director of Tesla. Has the third largest gigafactory in the United States, having taken the reigns of the abandoned Lordstown, Ohio plant GM left to rot just a few years ago. Their main slice of pie is the Lordstown Endurance, an EV pickup truck that already has working prototypes. Press has included having the Endurance parked at the White House and the Endurance being driven by a guy from CNBC. They plan to bring the Endurance to market by end of year/early next year.


The Endurance as of this post has no direct competitor. Its an EV pickup truck marketed to the working class man. Its priced at $52,500 offering 250 mile gas range, tow capability of 6,000lbs. Pre-orders booked at 100,000 as of January 12.

The factory is in full working shape. The company isn't fucking around and fluffing investors. They stated their mission, showed a proof of concept and got to work.

This also brings a story to sell the news on of a destitute American town that GM abandoned and time forgot, being saved by new hard working jobs, crafting top of the line American-made pickup trucks.


This last point gets more bullish with Biden's recent executive order and how much he's proven to be invested in the future of EV. Upon taking a look at the government fleet of vehicles he intends on replacing with EV's, a sizeable portion are pickup trucks. Even disregarding this, the mission is clear to have an EV manufacturer for the USPS. And I'll say this one more time - THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR TO THE ENDURANCE.

Say what you will about the Cybertruck but its just not a proper candidate for the Endurance's demographic. The Hummer EV is priced at $90k. Ford's at least another year away from the F150 EV.

Federal catalysts for huge growth:

* this USPS contract. If Workhorse gets it that's good for Lordstown Motors as they'll be building a portion of those trucks for them. If Lordstown gets it that's even better

* Lordstown recently asked the Fed for a loan. They won't be the only EV company provided with federal assistance as Tesla was given the same many years ago

* Biden and Buttigieg love EV, want to subsidize and invest in the infrastructure, build a future for American-based EV companies

Looks like a possible great growth and dividend stock.  RILY or B. Riley Financial is an  investment bank that has shown some interesting setups recently and at  the moment, it seems like a steal. Here's why I think so

\-  RILY has had consistently large insider investing from big people in  the company. Riley Bryant (CEO) himself has bought over 15 million  shares just this month. The CEO, knows more about the company's health  than any of us will ever do and if he puts this much trust into the  company, then he is certain of growth for its future. For more info,  check out [http://openinsider.com/RILY](http://openinsider.com/RILY)

\-  On top of insider investing, successful institutional investors such as  BlackRock Inc and Vanguard have a 5.13 and 3.33% stake respectively but  we aren't seeing too much institutes here either. Only 135 and this  suggests there is room for further institutional sponsorship. Majority  of successful institutional investors have actually been focusing on the  financial services sector due to Lock-down so the possibility is there for RILY to come up in the spotlight.

\- RILY has large  momentum and is in an uptrend. Since its IPO on October of last year, the  share price has nearly doubled. It has relatively low volume though and combine that with a low number of institutes, the moment we see institutes hopping on board and buying RILY, the stock will skyrocket.  It's also near its 52wk high and seems that it's getting more traction  as time goes on.

\- RILY has great  fundamentals, increasing EPS momentum, an above average 14.2% ROE, 41%  Quarterly earnings growth, 3.13% Dividend yield.

I use a very small brokerage account as an "Emergency Fund/Explore the Market" account. I started with just under $1,000 as per Dave Ramsey's initial emergency fund/baby step. I couldn't stand just letting the money sit in a shit savings account, so I invested it in some "basics," like Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson.

Has someone some insights on why DOYU is trading so much lower than HUYA at the moment?

A little more Background:
In oktober last year both companies entered into a merger agreement, which will make DouYu a fully owned subsidiary of Huya. The merger is expected to close jn the first half of 2021 and is a stock-for-stock merger. So, every DOYU share will be converted into a HUYA share with a conversion factor of 0,73. 
Besides, both companies announced that they will be paying out a dividend which is only slightly  higher for huya shareholders at the date of the merger.
Huya will be paying out $200mio while DouYu will be paying out $60mio.
https://ir.douyu.com/2020-10-12-Huya-and-DouYu-Enter-into-Merger-Agreement

It seems like a textbook arbitrage opportunity:
Huya is trading at roughly $26
DouYu is trading at roughly $13.5
So if you buy DouYu you are effectively buying Huya for $18.5 = 13.5/0.73. That's a 30% discount!

I ignored the dividends to make it a little simpler. With dividends the spread is a little lower yes, but the effect is too small to make a significant difference for my argument.

I have a position in DouYu and I am a little confused. It seems like the market does not expect the merger to be completed. Is there something I am missing?

Hi folks, I believe that technologies for carbon capturing and storage will play a major part in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next 100y. Call me negative, but I don't see how we change humans to reduce their emissions voluntarily. And all forced measures will make any government in a democratic country highly unlikely to get re-elected.  
Now you might say: but why don't we just make things more efficient? Let's electrify cars, improve insulation and change oil heating to solar energy.  
Good idea. But at the same time world population grows from 7.6b (now) to \~11.5b by the end of the century and year by year there are hundreds of millions ppl which enter middle class and start to fly, buying cool things and pollute the environment like we western people already do for decades.

Ergo if we can't prevent greenhouse gases from getting produced, we need smart technologies to filter them out and store it. I'm following this technology already for a bit and recent events (papa elon offers 100mio for advances in technology \[[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/musks-100-million-prize-is-for-tech-the-world-desperately-needs/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/musks-100-million-prize-is-for-tech-the-world-desperately-needs/)\]; Joe Biden is not an enemy of oil, but still wants to make US climate neutral) just confirm that this is one of the important technologies in our war against climate extinction.

Assuming that I'm right: how to invest in such technologies? 

1. There are many interesting startups already providing working solutions and having a decent size (e.g. [https://www.climeworks.com/](https://www.climeworks.com/)). Unfortunately though they are all not listed yet and therefore not tradable. I checked a few of the names on [https://equityzen.com/](https://equityzen.com/listings/), unfortunately without success.
2. Large oil companies (e.g. Exxon Mobil, Petronas) seem to invest heavily in this field. For me investing in these companies though is not an option. First of all I don't invest in oil companies as I don't wanna be part of the problem and second I believe that all the gains this stocks would make thanks to their CSS projects are killed by the fact that their main business is still drilling for oil/gas.
3. There seems to be other large companies like e.g. General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Ltd. also investing into such technologies. But is investing into such largely diversified companies really the only option to invest in this tech?

Is there something I'm missing? How would you invest in carbon capture storage technology assuming that you believe it will become a game changing tech? Do I simply need to wait?

P.S. don't get me wrong, I don't believe CSS is the only green technology with high potential.

More coming with low float, over sold, overshorted, and grossly undervalued market cap. Bears think that articles from several years ago before SLS took over Galena ticker are even remotely relevant and that posting them on Reddit and Stocktwits is breaking shocking news hahaha. SLS just signed a massive $200 million licensing deal with $7 million upfront and another $8.5 million near term plus royalty payments based on the sale of GPS in China and they don't have to spend a dime, 3D Meds is doing all of it. This was one of the top 10 licensing deals in 2020 for China BIO. Not to mention we had amazing GPS and NPS trial data that was recently released and shorts oversold the held out of it again to suppress the news. That is fine it always bounces back faster and higher when shorts do that.

SLS has plenty of cash on hand with the exercising of the warrants from the $3.00 private placement in the summer of 2020 and the last direct offering done at $7.00 share on 12/14. They have more than $35 million in cash with a $3-$4 million a quarter burn rate. T**hey are about to post the first-ever positive earnings for Q4 of 2020 in March. It's not too late to get in before that major milestone.** The brokers/markets makers are currently get hit with reg sho failure to deliver violations to the sum of 1,209,183 shares from December. That is almost 10% of the available float in failure to deliver! That combined with the excessive short interest is the perfect combination for a massive squeeze.

The burn rate is super low so the shorts only hope of more dilution or another reverse split is completely gone, that is why they are panicking. SLS has plenty of cash for years and the GPS licensing deal with Chain was only for China. One country, plenty more to come especially considering we just got IMPD approval for our phase 3 regal study with GPS from the French Regulatory Authority and German Regulatory Authority. $$$ is coming soon from European Countries.

I've been in and accumulating like crazy for over 2 years. 102,081 shares at a $3.13 average. I held all the way through the $1.45 shake out in April of 2020.

Nothing negative has come out to justify the price action. It's shorts trying their last-ditch effort to keep their cash cow. But the problem is, it's beyond undervalued. At a $71 Million market cap, it should be north of a billion when you look at every comp with the pipeline and stage they are in. The fact that we are still under $250 million and we have commercialization dollars coming in from China is absolutely insane.

1) MM's are allowed to also invest in other businesses/hedge funds (that, for a relevant example, may be losing a large amount of money on shorts)

2) MM's have the right (or duty, as some might see it) to naked short sell any stock in order to address liquidity (something that is decreased by people holding stocks and not selling) **provided they buy it back by EOD.**

3) Naked short selling of this nature greatly affects price, thus allowing those same MM's to profit from buying back stock, provided a reasonable volume and a slower re-purchase than the original short sell.

4) Naked short selling is generally otherwise illegal and is the dream of many large investors/funds because it allows for easy and rapid stock price manipulation in order to take profit...for this exact reason.

Will retail investors continue to squeeze out shorts? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a wild stock market, with the markets starting off in the green before having a drop in early morning trading but eventually finishing off with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/xhtxHrZ) gaining 0.69%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6mykhfj) rising by .36% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vDQsrLs) lost 37 points as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/tMyRKvN) rose by almost 6% and was even over 26 at one point.

We finished the day with 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SvJnHLr) declining on average volume with the number of companies above the moving averages remaining pretty much the same as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/zVkwnQK) actually finished in the green, with Utilities and Consumer Staples leading the way while Energy was the biggest laggard, dropping just over 1%, but recovered from the lows of the day.

Large-Cap Growth Companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/8sM97kV) the markets while the rest of the groups were underperforming as big tech managed to stay positive through the lows as you can also see in yesterday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JKNzC7f), with Apple, Microsoft & Tesla leading the way, while Banks & Industrials joined the Energy sector in losing ground.

[Today](https://ibb.co/hdnyZsJ) we start the day off with Redbook chain store sales, the Shiller Home Index, Consumer Confidence and a lot of earnings reports from the likes of JNJ, 3M, as we also have [possible](https://ibb.co/9T4w2f0) volatility in Li Auto, GE, Freeport and Plug Power, before the big tech earnings start to trickle in after-hours with AMD, Microsoft & Starbucks

I’ll be watching to see what JNJ may announce on their vaccine progress while AMD will be under the spotlight to see if they manage to continue to take market share from Intel.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see small stocks having a wild ride, as the battle of the short’s vs WSB continues. This has become a major battle with multiple heavily shorted stocks gaining massive in the last days & weeks.

And though I don’t encourage anyone to seek such high and fast returns, these events can last long enough to break the short-sellers as this event can keep on going for an unknown period of time before the fundamentals of the company retake center stage, so don’t try and fight the market, if you don’t seek high volatility, it’s just better to avoid getting to much exposure to these names.

You should seek long-term capital gains, as you can see [here](https://ibb.co/x3Zhjx5), the probability of you having negative return keeps getting lower and lower the longer your time horizon gets. You can just gamble and have a 54% chance of having a positive gain in any random day, but as you move the time-frame along, that chance goes to 94% if you invest for 10years which is pretty much as safe as you can get in money investment, as staying invested is the best way to go, just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/ssgvs70) through March, staying invested had turned 1$ into over 15$ in under 30 years, while missing the 25 best days only managed a return of about 5$. But missing both the best & worst 25 days did have a higher return, though timing the market is nearly impossible as markets can act irrational for a very long time and you might start to wonder when is the actual [time](https://ibb.co/28z6hTZ) to sell or buy, while in reality, no one knows what the markets will do in the short-term and trying to predict that is pure speculation and a waste of time that could be used for long-term investing.

You can also see that there isn’t any political effect usually to [investing](https://ibb.co/mD6kQ5s), as the probability of the stock market rising in any year doesn’t depend that much on what is the year of the term of the current president, though you can see a slightly bigger chance in the first year of a Presidential term.

And one last thing I wanted to talk about is the type of [assets](https://ibb.co/ysw2yQn) I think are best suited for the current situation. As you can see the SP500 has largely outperformed most other asset classes, but I think this might change this year, with small-caps being more exposed to an improving economy and international stocks benefiting from further QE easing in the US, which will make the dollar weaker, thus increasing the returns you can get in international stocks.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1vsT3vM) are pointing to flattish open, with the Dow Jones leading the way.

 I work at openreach in the UK, I started as an engineer and I now work in a role which manages the roll out of FTTP nationwide.

Why is nobody talking about Huawei being banned due to security concerns. 

THIS has led to Nokia becoming nearly the sole provider for equipment which will end up in millions of homes, thousands of exchanges and street cabinets. Nokia in the UK alone will be a name which ends up in millions upon millions of homes again when they all end up having their GPON 1+1 ONTS installed in as copper networks are phased out.

Nearly all new build properties like the major majority is having this stuff installed because openreach offer it to sites with like more than 10 homes for free but we still have to buy the equipment from Nokia lol that isn't free. 

The homes which aren't new build, so the majority of the UK are being built in sections to the underground boxes/poles outside of homes, after an area of let's say 40,000 homes is built, the copper network has a timer set and when that runs out people will be forcefully migrated onto the new FTTP network. This won't be a choice! Every home will need new Nokia equipment as mentioned above (ONT) which is like a router but its the termination point for fibre. Fibre will not work without them. 

We are the biggest telecom infrastructure builder in the UK with the biggest FTTP footprint which is also the fastest growing footprint. Nokia will once again be found in millions of UK homes with their branded onts. 
We do have competitors like virgin who are shite, and other competitors like hyper optic and city fibre. But they are targeting different criteria, where as Openreach is EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE. 

If you want to discuss Nokia, remember the above, FTTP is Huge for them, all I see anybody mentioning is 5g lol. I don't know much about that. But I do know they are being cemented into the network which will be used for over 100 years. Again I can only speak for the UK

ALL EXCHANGES owned by the BT group (parent company for openreach) are also installing and using Nokia head end OLTs which is where the fibre starts, Nokia hydra cables to connect OLT to ODF. Nokia SFP inside the OLT. This equipment is a big deal, and its fucking expensive.

Street cabinets FTTC and FTTC with gfast pods will become Nokia too as Huawei equipment is retired and replaced in the future. These are on nearly every street corner UK wide and will be replaced by Nokia equipment if they are not overlapped by FTTP which is being built using Nokia equipment anyway

I bought £400 in Nokia yesterday, sorry if this is seen as a pump. Its not. But if people want to pump Nokia, please can you at least include this DD which is a fucking gigantic piece of information nobody is discussing

TLDR- HUAWEI was banned in more places than just the USA. UK also banned due to security. Nokia is now providing equipment which is building the majority of elements from exchange end to customer end of the FTTP journey for millions of homes across the UK._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An honest case on NOK Hi all, 

I've been seeing all these posts about shady accounts trying to hype Nokia etc. Dunno anything about that, but I feel like I should ship into this conversation. 

First of all, a few weeks ago, I made a bad decision (hindsight 20/20) and decided to sell my NOK shares. Didn't have a big position to begin with, but still. You can see the [screenshot of that transaction here](https://imgur.com/a/8Nd0PUH).  (It is in Finnish, but it says I sold 1150 shares at 3,18 on 8th of January).

Now today, after some careful consideration, I decided to hop back in, with a bigger, 9k position. [Screen here](https://imgur.com/a/pxZiEhW). 

I'll tell you why. 

First of all, every Finn has an opinion about Nokia, and they're very sentimental and nostalgic about it.  The company made a lot of people rich and they hope it'll become one of the great ones someday. And they're willing to hang on through the toughest of times. I do not know how much of the hype on interest is made up and how much is real, but I'm sure many Finns will view the latest surge in the stock price as a positive and - I believe - will jump back in and go long. The company has been all over the local news yesterday and today, so the media is adding to the hype. 

Second, I think the company has been undervalued for quite some time now. And I don't blame the investors. There was every reason to think that the company was done for. But now it genuinely looks like there is a meaningful change coming. It might take a few years, but the company has definitely renewed their strategy and is moving in the right direction. 

Third, the analysts seem to agree. In the past week at least 4 different analysts have upgraded their target price. Latest were banks Danske Bank to 4,30€ and Handelsbanken to 4,40€.

To sum it up, the hype might not last, but I genuinely feel the potential is there._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it a good idea to sell a stock that has good profit, only to then rebuy it with the new more cash you got? Long term hold I searched the questions in the subreddit but many posts were about taxes and such, this is a non-american post, I think taxes on the market works different for us

So for example, I bought a stock for 5k that has 60%+ profit now, and I wonder if it is a good idea to sell that stock, only to rebuy it with all the money I got when I sold? I still belivie in the stock and want to keep hold it, and in my eyes the gains is gonna be higher now when I re-bought it with more money as the stock rises

Imagine how many people bought a certain stock at full price yesterday. Imagine how many are about to buy the next dump that's been posted over there for weeks.


These are meant to be different subs. Ours is for discussion and theirs is for pump and dumps. Starting to feel the same.

I'm not seeing a lot of FOMO into this stock as this may be the best catalyst the company will ever had with the Pandemic and worldwide vaccinations.

\- **Revenue Growth YoY was 132.75%** (last earnings reports)  
\- **Gross Profit Growth YoY was 267.01%**  
\- **Net Income Growth, YoY was 742.00%**  
\- **Earnings before Int. & Taxes was 957.57%**

I know the stock is not sexy or pump up but I think it could return some money into 2021...  
The stock was already up a lot in 2020 btw...

I'm a holder since $4.  
Curious to know the thinking on this.

I've collected a list of news that will help you understand why Nokia is moving.

I believe, that both Nokia and Ericsson, and to a smaller extent Samsung will thrive in the next couple of years, because of the Huawei ban.

It's old news, that Huawei is banned from tenders in the USA, but very few people are aware, that it's also happening outside the US and not only banning from new tenders, but in many cases, it means that operators are swapping existing Huawei (and ZTE) equipment. This is big news, as it allows Ericsson/Nokia/Samsung to recoup the revenue that they've lost to Huawei and ZTE in the last couple of years.  
These infrastructure deals are long term deals, so don't expect the revenue to jump in the next quarter, but I expect steady improvements over 2021 and 2022.  


This stock has a 5 billion float, so don't expect that you can pump it, and don't expect a short squeeze either. These deals are expected to profit you in the long term, 2-3 years, not days/weeks, it's just that   


Here is a list on the news coverage:

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

5g has several advantages over current technology including higher speed, the capacity to transfer a larger volume of data, less latency, and less interference. Current cellular technologies work in sub GHz but 5g will take advantage of 10-30 GHz. This means that the cellphones that we are using right now will not work with 5g and we all need to get new cellphones. Additionally, this new technology will be used for automation etc. So Apple, Samsung, and all others in the cellphone industry get a boost from selling new cellphones, companies like ERIC are active in building communication devices such as antenna, receive etc, and semiconductor companies like TSM will take a boost from building the core of cellular technology. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does it make sense to invest in McDonald's before they release their quarterly earnings report?

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

I'm a beginner and am about to start investing in stocks so sorry if this is common knowledge but I just want to understand how useful researching can be. Coming from an analytical field myself, I'm wondering, as someone who doesn't trade for a living how useful is it really to do your due diligence and research the market, does it have any tangible impact?


Isn't the price of a stock already factoring in all the publicly available knowledge, especially comparing to people who do this for a living and have access to a plethora of tools/models, does sitting at home and reading financial statements, or listening to an analyst/index you believe in really up your chances of netting a positive return? The only way I see that being possible is if doing those things puts you above 50% of other people, and is not doing them automatically putting you in the bottom 50%?


I know long-term, these factors matter less and reports etc. are less valuable, but wondering in the short-term, is there a bias in how much people believe they can determine the market?


Sorry again if this is a stupid question, I just hear a lot of friends and families always saying to do your research to make better choices/investments, or providing anecdotal evidence on wins they've had which to me seemed more like confirmation bias.


I do plan on doing research just so I can know more about the companies I personally believe in, but it feels like spending too much time thinking about whether a company is undervalued/overvalued would yield the same result as flipping a coin.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TESLA: the mother of all bubbles. U.S. GDP = 21 Trillion (Entire U.S. economy)
TESLA Market Cap = 0.834 Trillion (Almost a Trillion)

The Tesla bubble cannot burst. It is too important for the economy. 

Tesla produced 509,000 cars in 2020. That is 18× LESS of what Toyota produced and sold in 2020, yet Tesla is valued at 4X the Market Cap of Toyota.

The dot.com bubble is microscopic compared to this bubble. This is the VY Canis Majoris of all stock market bubbles, and it cannot burst because it would trigger a ripple effect in the economy.

TESLA has a negative 900 million net income (loss) and its stock value keeps rising and rising (frenzy) as if Tesla owned Space X and all of Elon's companies that are not part of Tesla.

This frenzy, fueled by people simply buying on any dip telling themselves "Tesla will revolutionize the world" Investing all their life's saving every time Elon does anything: Elon is wearing kahki pants today, here 5K more of my savings, Elon moved to Texas here 20K more of my savings, Elon is making a super ultra futuristic "advanced" battery for a car that takes you from A to B like any other car, here 10K more of my savings, Elon tweeted Unicorn, that must mean something, here I refinanced my home to invest it all in Tesla, Elon farted today, here 5K more! This is just crazy. Teenagers and college students are just buying and buying Tesla and they have no clue about Tesla's balance sheet.

Based on car sales, Tesla is worth $12 Billion.

500,000 car sales cannot justify a trillion dollar market cap. Tesla shareholders will get burned.

It might burst in 2021. It is just too big. If it doubles, the market cap would reach 1.7 Trillion.

Apple has a 2.4 Trillion market cap because it is a leader in cell phones sales worldwide in addition to the billions it makes in computer and laptop sales, and other tech. Apple makes financial sense but Tesla does not even produce a positive income. Apple made $57.411 Billion in NET income in 2020 while Tesla made negative 900 million in 2019 and had a greater loss in 2020.

If this bubble bursts a lot of people will get hurt, particularly YOUNG investors. All the paper millionaires will become poor in a few days, similar to what occured when the dot.com bubble burst.

I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla has a machinery of people just hired to post positive Tesla news on Reddit to keep pumping it's stock value up. The most common brainwashing phrases: "Tesla is not just a car company, Tesla is the Future" "Tesla's Autonomous driving will take over the world" and more nonsense._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What Happened at Around 11:00 today?

Thanks!

May your tendies be bountiful :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is my leap option on a stock generating less profit than expected? I am still trying to understand how call options work and some clarification would be greatly appreciated. I am bullish on a stock and I expect it to hit at least 30 minimum by the end of the year so I decided to buy some shares and my first leap option.

I bought a call expiring September for $820 with a strike price of $17 and I bought 23 shares of the stock today which cost me $406. Looking at todays profit I am up $58 from options while I am up $55 from 23 shares that I bought for a total of $406.

How come my 23 shares (which i payed $406) is generating the same profit as my call option in which I payed $820 ? Like looking at it now, wouldn't I generate twice the profit if I bought more shares instead of buying the option?

Other questions if you guys could answer:

1. If I am bullish on the stock hitting at least $30 by the end of the year what approach would generate the most profit? And say it did hit 30+: Would it be better to buy multiple call options ending months later or 1 leap option that is ITM or OTM?
2. Since I had the money for the premium was it better to buy an option with a strike price that is not far OTM? Like when buying leaps why do people choose strike prices that are far OTM? Is it just less risk and not so much a factor of profit?

I understand that you guys are not providing financial advice and anything posted will not be taken as so.

Is there a way for me to post screenshots of the call option I bought and the profit I made from the shares here?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Werner Invests in TuSimple to Spur Autonomous Trucking It is intended to demonstrate, among other things, Werner’s focus on the growth and deployment of automated driving systems, the regulations required for increased safety, reduced carbon emissions and eventual industry adoption, according to the Omaha, Neb.-based company.
TuSimple is focused on improving truck safety and fuel efficiency through its SAE Level 4 technology, in which the vehicle can travel without driver input or backup assistance, at least within specific areas and conditions.



“Our customers are experiencing continued business transformation, one that requires immediate fulfillment, industry leading service and safety and a greater desire for solutions that further their business and the sustainability of our planet,” Werner CEO Derek Leathers said in a press release.
At the same time, staying current with emerging technologies helps improve drivers’ lives, keeps them safer, provides drivers with “best-in-class equipment and helps them achieve long-term careers in the trucking industry,” he added.
In related news, TuSimple announced it added to its executive advisory board Schneider CEO Mark Rourke. Motor carrier and logistics company Schneider took a “nominal investment” in TuSimple and will provide a test fleet as it, too, shapes the future of autonomous trucking.

In recent years, Green Bay, Wis.-based Schneider has invested in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as collision mitigation and adaptive cruise control, which are the foundation of autonomous vehicle technology. 
Schneider ranks No. 5 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers in North America. It ranks No. 18 on the Transport Topics Top 50 list of the largest logistics companies.
Werner's investment in TuSimple followed Werner’s announcement in May of Werner EDGE, an initiative that promotes technology-rich driver solutions — including machine learning to improve critical event management, cloud-based breakdown management and tablet-based telematics.
Werner Enterprises ranks No. 16 on the for-hire TT100 and No. 17 on the logistics Top 50.


Meanwhile, TuSimple, which has offices in San Diego and China, added other partnerships over the past year.
In September, TuSimple and Traton Group, Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck unit, announced a partnership to develop SAE Level 4 self-driving trucks, calling it a first in Europe. Traton also took a minority stake in TuSimple.
In July, TuSimple and truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp. announced a strategic partnership to co-develop SAE Level 4 self-driving trucks targeted for production by 2024.



In November, the boards of directors at Traton and Navistar approved a definitive agreement to merge as part of a transaction valued at $3.7 billion.
TuSimple President Cheng Lu told Transport Topics at the time of its announcement with Navistar: “What we are doing is designing, basically a new truck. The brains, what the body looks like, where you put the sensors, how you get the power. They’re not just buying a component from us. So you can imagine the amount of work that takes. It is something we have to be very selective about in terms of partnerships.”

For those who sold BBBY, congrats on locking in your profits or, taking back your initial investment so you are left with "free money."  I am normally not one to sell; when I saw the price spiraling up out of control beyond my personal understanding, I felt comfortable pulling the trigger and moving on to other opportunities.  **Remember, there are always opportunities to make a sound investment**.  I still believe in BBBY long term and I still have a position in the stock as I only took out my initial investment.  And I may add to it as I monitor how the company does moving forward.

So, with all that said.  Here is my case for HIMS!

1. **Macrotrend**:  HIMS provides a subscription-based service that provides its clients with access to certain prescription drugs, skin care items, sexual health and hair loss solutions.  It focuses on these issues that people may not be comfortable to readily and openly seek help for, which may offer a particularly attractive opportunity for men (as there, for better or for worse, tends to be a cultural stereotype around men that either frowns upon these issues or tells men that they are not supposed to care).  Enter HIMS, a telemedicine company that allows its clients to upload their medical history, speak with a healthcare provider, and subscribe to the company's services all behind closed doors.  It's a great concept, that I, personally, think will catch on especially as this macrotrend begins to overlap and include the overall trend of people continuing to stay indoors.
2. **MOAT?  Branding:**  Telemedicine is picking up and there are other players in the market.  That said, I do think the HIMS brand is unique.  It's simple.  It sticks.  And speaking of sticking, they seem to be doing a great job of holding on to their subscribers (90%+).
3. **Financials and Price**: HIMS is currently not making any profits.  Understandably so.  They are focused on growth at the moment and they want to expand their brand into other drugs/healthcare solutions.  However, their future outlook is pretty solid.  They currently have 250 M users and I can definitely see them growing their clientele.  Given their 90%+ retention rate, we are looking at revenue that sticks for longer periods of time.  Furthermore the costs of customer acquisition are only about $110 whereas their returns per customer are 3X that at around $300.  Lastly, the stock as came down about 25% since its merger, which to me, felt like a good entry point.

What I did and what to monitor:  Entered a position of 1-2% of my overall portfolio.  Looking to DCA up or down with a goal of about 3-4% depending on future earnings.  I am eyeing in on the company's continued retention rate, their growth in clientele, and, if they are investing in themselves quarter after quarter, continued double digit revenue growth.

&#x200B;

There's a lot more to uncover about HIMS.  Remember to do your DD and best of luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 103k weekly $40C PLTR contracts purchased today Thinking this will really run, especially Tuesday, as the hyped demo day is after hours then.

||||_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Now is the time to take some position in the semiconductor big players (specially TSM) Lately, I have been reading more and more concerns about the demand-supply gap in the semiconductor sector, to some extent driven by  the Trump administration’s actions against key Chinese chip factories.  

Some recent articles:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55704936](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55704936)

TLDR: Car companies such as Audi and VW slowing down production because they are not able to acquire enough chipsets needs for their cars

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-autos-chips/germany-urges-taiwan-to-help-ease-auto-chip-shortage-idUSKBN29T04V?il=0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-autos-chips/germany-urges-taiwan-to-help-ease-auto-chip-shortage-idUSKBN29T04V?il=0)

TLDR: Germany seeking help from TSM to alleviate the chip shortage for the auto industry

[https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors#:\~:text=The%20World%20Is%20Dangerously%20Dependent%20on%20Taiwan%20for%20Semiconductors,-Alan%20Crawford&text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20As%20China%20pushes,become%20on%20the%20island%20democracy](https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors#:~:text=The%20World%20Is%20Dangerously%20Dependent%20on%20Taiwan%20for%20Semiconductors,-Alan%20Crawford&text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20As%20China%20pushes,become%20on%20the%20island%20democracy).

TLDR:  US/Europe/Japan asking TSM to step in and help them in their chip shortage, and EU is initiating a 30B Euro initiative to increase the EU's semiconductor market share to 20% (from the current value of 10%)

The figure, taken from the Bloomberg article, shows the major players and their revenue and their specialization within the industry

I find TSM and ASML to be extremely interesting among those listed above: TSM for the obvious reasons that are mentioned in the articles I linked, ASML, because they hold the monopoly on the machines that are used for manufacturing the chips. This article from the economist gives a very nice explanation on ASML's dominance and importance:

[https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly)

And take into consideration this shortage of chips is happening during a pandemic. When we return to normality, hopefully later this year or sometime next year, and add to that the increase in 5G adoption,  EVs, autonomous driving, AR/VR, IoT, etc.. the demand is going increase like crazy.

Thus, I highly recommend those of you who don't have a position in this sector to start nibbling on some shares of the major players.

I am a bit short on cash now, but I plan to slowly add up on all of them, specially ASML and TSM._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ No love for Ericsson (ERIC)? Nokia is about to be the next meme stock while Ericsson currently has better fundamentals. I honestly believe that Ericsson has a lead over Nokia in the 5g race. I have both shares but am I missing something on why Nokia gets the attention?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It seems like no investors talk about TSMC They've got fantastic financials, and a near monopoly on semiconductor productions with huge tech customers.  *ALL* of AMD's Ryzen chips are made at TSMC. Nvidia's chips are made at TSMC. Apple's chips are made at TSMC. Even Intel outsources semiconductor production to TSMC. Buying TSMC is going to let you ride the wave on all those tech companies. They also have a short volume of around 16% which makes no sense considering how good their outlook is. They maintain massive profit margins and enjoy economies of sale.

(1) Their B2C business has been booming post the lockdown. Home office chairs, Gaming chairs and so on. Expect this to continue in the post lockdown economy when people will split time between work and office.
(2) Huge pent-up demand from offices / schools etc once they’re fully reopen.
(3) Despite being an office furniture manufacturer, they’ve been delivering higher earnings than the previous year in the last two quarters. They’ve been very prudent with managing costs - and once things open up, expect a nice bump
(4) Trading at 25% discount to Nov 2019 price (office furniture manufacturer prices started to dip around Dec 2019 as a result of Covid scare). Can’t seem to explain this since they’re already beating 2019 earnings and revenue figures in recent quarters. I’ve seen companies doing far worse and trading at above pre Covid levels. If anything, they should be trading at a 25% premium given that office furniture business should pick up and the B2C business has good a rocket booster on it.
(5) Strong liquidity. Can easily withstand another year or more of lockdown if needed.
(6) Management seems to be competent and quick / effective in responding to market changes.

Would love inputs from members, especially to see if I have any blind spots._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options vs stocks? Past few months ive learned a little about stocks and bought shares in various stocks. Well a friend was telling me about options and how that’s where you make your money. 

Whats the pros and cons of buying options over stocks?

Some stocks i want to hold long term vs short term so should i go options route or buy stock flat out?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLAYBOY - A promising turn-around play I hope this doesn't fall under the subreddit rule no. 7 - while it's officially still pre-merger, Playboy will be tradeable under its own ticker in 2-3 weeks from now.


Imo, Playboy has everything to become an extremely successful turn-around play. Absolutely undervalued with a low mcap and a 100m cash reserve.

Here's the case:

All Heffners are gone and with them now all money-burning magazine printing business has ceased. The mansion has been sold and the company got a new activist CEO. 
In China and India they are becoming a stable brand for “Sexual Wellness“ and swim / beach appearel. They are a profitable company with a YoY revenue increase of +70%.

In addition, they are moving into online gambling and sport betting, and are widely successful this far.

EBITDA goal for 2025: $100m.


Bear case:

The brand and image might be difficult to handle. While it's possible to transform to a self-aware “retro-cool“ sexual wellness brand, there is a possibility it will be asociated with porn and be seen as an outdated dinosaur by younger generations.

I have some shares in Cryport. I bought them around $40 a share and they rose to $80ish very quickly so that was great. However, today it quickly fell to $72, following the announcement that Cryport would be “closing its public stock offering of common stock”. Remaining shares will be underwritten at $66. 

I can’t seem to find a good explanation of what this means that is easy to understand. It seems I might as well sell it now? What happens if I do nothing? I want to learn and was hoping to hear what others might be doing with their CRYX, or if anyone could give some insights.

Happy money making you cake eaters_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MAC - a good reopening / short squeeze play Shopping mall REITs have been crushed last year , on COVID and e-commerce boom, but are Grade A malls really dead?  I’m already longing for a shopping trip, and I don’t think bricks and mortar will go extinct anytime soon. If things reopen, there should be a physical shopping spree, and well located malls should do well.

Fat dividends coming?
So from a dividend angle, MAC pays around $0.75/ quarter pre-covid, and has cut it down to $0.15/quarter last year, as rent collections were uncertain, but turns out they were able to collect  80% of rents since Q3 and that number is improving.   Let’s say they can resume only 50% of their 2019 dividend, that’s $1.5/shr / annum, and on a 6% dividend yield assumption ( which looks very juicy in a very low interest rate environment) , this thing can go to $25/share. Seems there are articles out there on seeking alpha suggesting an even higher number. 


Short squeeze angle?

 Everyone is talking about short squeezes lately, let’s look at MAC’s short interest, 58% of freefloat shorted, and borrow costs have gone up massively lately, looks ripe for a health squeeze. Volumes picked up in the last few trading sessions, but looks like this is just the beginning.
