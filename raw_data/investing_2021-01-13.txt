Then I use the RSI, Stoch, Vortex, and 10-50-200 EMAs\*\*

&#x200B;

$CANF - Obvious higher lows past consolidation zones. I think it has a chance to come back down to our channel too. Aim for $1.80 buy in. Stoch is low so that is good.

$CNCE - Obvious up trend. At multiple supports, and bouncing off the 50EMA. RSI fair, but Stoch and Vortex look good for a continuation.

$CRK - This is going to pull back. Not to $4.5 but around $5.0 most likely, look for a 50EMA bounce. Everything is overbought, but I do not want you to miss this.

$FLXN - Steady up trend, holding right above the 200EMA. Trying to break the POC currently. See if it can make it to the channel. Stoch is low and Vortex says we have a little more to drop.

$GERN - Is it finally reversing?! Holding support and trying to break 200EMA. If it dies tomorrow you have to wait to buy in. Stoch and vortex low.

$GMED - Steady up trend that aligns with the 50EMA. Holding support too. Stoch is low, and vortex show continuation. RSI Fair.

$GNK - Testing old resistance for support. Also holding the 50EMA currently. Stoch is very low, but Vortex and RSI fair at best.

$GSKY - Obvious up trend we have played 2 times now. Holding support and 50EMA. Reversals do take a week days so be patient. Vortex and Stoch very low.

$KPTI - No one jinx this, please god lol. Watch carefully... how often does this happen? Aim for a $15 buy in. All indicators show reversal soon as well.

$OPTT - While writing this it is showing life so who knows. 2 week reversal period so be patient, but watch this carefully. Wait for channel or 200EMA bounce. Indicators fair.

$PM - Currently at channel, support, and holding over 200EMA. Double bottom? Indicators are low, could be a nice continuation.

$TWNK - Pulling back to channel, it does have some space to drop. But 50EMA bounce is happening. Vortex low, Stoch low, RSI fair at best.

$VMW - Dying hard for a reason, for what IDK so check it out. But it will eventually reverse. In that are for one. Obviously all indicators super low.

$WEN - Great area of value. Done this 3 times now, just a great value. All indicators are low and reversal looking very promising here.

How do investors see IFRS 17 impacting stock valuations for life insurers / composites with large life arms?

I'm a life actuary with a financial reporting background and keen to understand how analysts and investors actually think about IFRS 17 and how close it ties in with how we look at it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Angel Investor Question I have recently been offered an opportunity to take a role as an angel investor by an old business associate. While I‚Äôve been an investor of many sorts over the years, I have never gone this route so I am unfamiliar with the process. 

I have so many questions, but before I bombard my fellow Reddit investors, I‚Äôd like to research for myself.

Can someone direct me to proper literature about this topic? I‚Äôd appreciate if someone could provide a copy of an angel investor agreement contract too. Also any tidbits or anecdotes about the subject would be greatly appreciated as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR)  

Hello investors,

Today, I wanted to share my thoughts on a company called Fiverr. This is one of my favorite companies and I believe the growth potential is enormous. Full disclosure, I have a large portion of my portfolio invested in this stock, in the form of shares and options.

For those interested in the model, please fill out this form to be put on the email distribution list so it makes it easier to send the spreadsheets. Keep in mind the company is small so the model will be much simpler.

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ6J9pFUq3At2yncsQ\_L4XalvVEVa-BW2nbHR7-bJ9BRKplA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0&gxids=7628&fbzx=4409293954243517011](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ6J9pFUq3At2yncsQ_L4XalvVEVa-BW2nbHR7-bJ9BRKplA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0&gxids=7628&fbzx=4409293954243517011)

Their business is not too difficult to understand. It operates a platform that allows freelancers to offer their digital services such as programming, marketing, brand designs, or video editing to start-ups or small businesses. It's basically the Amazon of digital services, as opposed to products.

Say you want to start a marketing company and need to design a logo. Instead of going to LinkedIn to post a job description for a 3-hour job, you can instead go to Fiverr platform and hire a designer to create a professional logo for you.

If the service is posted for $100, you pay $105 and the seller (the designer) will receive $80, Fiverr taking a total of $25 (5+20). This is a take rate of whooping 25%! (25/100). Their actual take rate for the twelve months ended in 9/30/2020 was 27%, up from 26.6% in 9/30/2019. Compare that to 3.24% monetization rate for Pinduoduo ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtn4ye/pinduoduo\_pdd\_11132020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtn4ye/pinduoduo_pdd_11132020/)).

It wouldn't be hard to convince people that freelancing will become a growing part of our gig economy, just like Uber allowed non-taxi drivers to offer their services or Airbnb allowed non-hoteliers to offer their services. Fiverr is allowing those with the capacity and skills to offer their services for those who need them. And small companies don't need to hire a full-time web developer and pay for their insurance, medical benefits, etc. It's a win-win for both the buyers and sellers.

This all makes sense so far but how effective and popular is this idea really? Is there enough demand from both sides of the transaction (the buyers, aka small businesses, and the sellers, aka freelancers) for this company to grow?

After going through the following charts, I felt more comfortable with how successful this platform is. It basically proves this model works extremely well.

For pictures, please refer to the original post as it doesn't allow me to post pictures here.

Operational results

üì∑üì∑

Not only the growing number of buyers is contributing to the top-line growth but also the spending per buyer growth is in effect compounding the revenue growth. This proves to show that each buyer is more than satisfied for a service he/she purchased and therefore, each one is spending more on the platform.

üì∑

This is probably the most impressive chart. The churn rate (the rate at which people cancel their subscriptions) is extremely low for a small tech company. Usually the churn rates are high for tech companies but this chart shows that the retention rate is enormous. Not only that, the new buyers are contributing larger portion of the total number of buyers on the platform, showing that the marketing team is doing something right.

üì∑

Now, without even using their service once, we know that something is working well for them with a high degree of conviction. It's hard to argue against their success up until this point.

All of these sound great and exciting, but the next part is the tricky part.

At what price can we get a share of this company? All company analyses should involve an assessment of the valuation.

I'll tell you upfront it's not cheap. And it shouldn't be since it's such a solid company with so much potential for growth. You have to pay a premium for really good companies, just like you have to pay extra to get those luxury handbags or watches.

The stock price closed at $254 on 1/13/2021, or $8.9B market cap.

Based on LTM sales, that's a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 55x. But for a small company like Fiverr, it's better to look at it from 2021 sales estimate standpoint, which yields 2021E P/S multiple of 33x assuming 50% revenue growth in 2021.

Compare that to 2021E 3.6x P/S for Amazon, 7x for Facebook, 5.5x for Google and 10.1x for MSFT. FVRR is trading at an extremely high multiple compared to the FANNG companies.

But those aren't really comparable because their market caps are too big. Thus we need to compare FVRR's 33x P/S with the below multiples.

üì∑

Looking at these numbers, FVRR still seems to be at the high end of the spectrum.

One thing to keep in mind is that FVRR has a high gross margin, which means for every $1 dollar the company makes, they keep 80 cents for themselves assuming 80% gross margin. Look at the below numbers.

üì∑

No wonder FVRR is trading at such a high multiple since their high gross margin allows them to have wider net margins later when they turn profitable.

Next is projecting out how the company would be valued if they hit certain financial milestones, such as 50% revenue growth. Below is my projection.

üì∑

By 2026, I would expect the company to triple its current valuation. However, this is assuming a very conservative scenario. Please remember that anyone can plug in whatever assumptions they want to make the projections rosier but the key aspect to remember is that the current valuation is high while the company is growing at a fast clip.

When you are trying to decide whether you should invest in the company because it is a great company but the valuation is too high, always remember this quote from Warren Buffett.

" It's far **better to buy** a wonderful **company** at a **fair price than** a **fair company** at a wonderful **price**. "

This means that it is better to buy a great company even if the valuation is too high than to buy a fair company at a great price. Now, be careful about the definition of valuation.

If the price paid is too high, then it will eat away your returns and it won't be worth it.

I always show people this graph of Microsoft during the tech boom. Yes, Microsoft was an amazing company in 1999 but look how many years it took for investors to breakeven in their stocks if they bought the shares at the top of the tech bubble.

üì∑

The point is that it's wise to buy a great company but the price has to be reasonable. Right now, at 33x 2021E P/S, I believe it is reasonable enough.

We may very well see a correction of more than 30% on the company, which will make it a great entry point. For anyone who is afraid of the height of valuation, then it would be wise to sit out on this or sell put options on the stock to collect the premium or buy back the stock when the price reaches your exercise price (more on this strategy to come in Options Trading Part IV). Regardless, the company will continue to grow in the future and over the next five years, the company will certainly be valued much higher than it is right now.

As always, please feel free to provide feedback! This is for educational purposes only and I would very much appreciate any ideas to make it more informative.

\*Gigafacotry Shangai is a huge growth and driving factor

\*Joe Biden's win and complete control of senate and house boost the chances of a green agenda that favors Tesla

\*Ability to raise capital is unparalleled with its peers and other Tech companies (invalidates bear thesis that they will need access to a lot of capital to expand and scale up)

\*Tesla rules ev and everyone pays rent (including ev companies like NIO in China)

\*China is the biggest market opportunity for electric vehicles and Tesla has the most demand

\*Electric vehicles will ramp from 3% to 10% of total auto sales by 2025 

\*Not an auto company or a tech company but a distributive company

I'm a little upset I didn't get to buy more Tesla when it crashed down to 808 territory the other day also was too busy to monitor the price today and misses the dip again. Hope everyone here who was anticipating a sell off/crash got in when it crashed from 880 to 808.

Billions of tons. 165 million of which are currently floating around in the ocean, and 9 million more tons are thrown in the ocean every year. 

This is a fast growing opportunity, in my view. Corporations want to look green. They want to score brownie points with consumers.

As pollution gets worse and worse, I think there will be tighter and tighter global regulations to switch to alternatives. Are there any notable companies (public or private) that engineer clean, biodegradable plastic?

This is what I do, where I work, how I spend my money, and in western Colorado, how most of the people I know do. So I'm making the list of companies that own the brands that I know or have bought.

A lot of these companies hold brands that fall into multiple of the categories, but I did the best I could.

I am sure I missed a bunch, too, so let me know and I'll edit to add.

**Hunting/guns & ammo:**

* $VSTO: Vista outdoors
* $SWBI: Smith and Wesson
* $RGR: Sturm and Ruger
* $AOUT: American Outdoor Brands

**Hiking/climbing/skiing/"REI outdoors":**

* $JOUT: Fishing tackle companies, JetBoil, Eureka, Cheap Kayaks and Canoes
* $YETI: Yeti brand coolers, mugs, ect
* $VFC:  Smartwool, Altra, Vans, Eastpak, JanSport, Eagle Creek, Dickies, Timberland PRO
* $WWW: Wolverine, Chaco, Merrell, Saucony, other "generic" shoes
* $CLAR: Clarus. Owns Black Diamond Equipment, and ammo company
* $MTN: Vail Resorts. All over the skiing world.
* $DECK: Teva, Uggs, Hoka

**RVs/ORVs/Boats:**

* $DOOO : Skidoo, Seadoo, Evinrude, others formerly under Bombardier
* $MCFT: Mastercraft boats
* $THO: Thor RVs, Airstream among others
* $PII: Polaris
* $BC: Brunswick Corp, Mercury outboard motors

**Other/general:**

* $NKE: Important not to underestimate the majors. Adidas owns 5.10 and is moving into the hiking and climbing space, and when Nike feels like it, they will too.
* $UA: UnderArmor. More of gym crowd, but a lot of runners love it.

A lot of outdoor brands are independent or held by private equity companies, but this is what I've found. Let me know who I've missed in this area of growing discretionary spending.

PS. I know a lot of these are big conglomerates, and I'm not going to go through and break down what percentage of the parent these brands are, so lots of DD required. For instance, if you love Brooks shoes, you wouldn't invest in BRK.B on the growth of Brooks Running.

PPS. I know I skipped bicycles all together! But I didn't find any US listed companies in the brands that I initially thought of, so I'll link to this list instead: [https://cyclingindustry.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CIN\_bicycle-stock-chart-2019.pdf](https://cyclingindustry.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CIN_bicycle-stock-chart-2019.pdf)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 40% upside on $BHC There's a short covering in progress right now on $BHC.

I've lately been looking into the "industrials" sector and there is a group of companies there which I think have a really impressive business model which seems to have worked well for building shareholder value. Posting in case others have research or similar experience they'd like to share.

Put broadly, this style of companies (a) intend to grow by acquisition, (b) are good at finding "moaty" businesses to acquire, (c) improve the efficiency of companies they acquire through better supply chains etc and (d) focus on free cash flow generation, which allows them to keep steadily acquiring. 

Specifically, the companies I'm thinking of:

- Roper (ROP), sometimes called the Berkshire-Hathaway of tech companies.

- The Danaher (DHR) "family", with spinoff Fortive (FTV) and most recently its spinoff, Vontier (VNT) -- all sharing a business philosophy developed from the Toyota production process.

- AMETEK (AME) and IDEX (IEX), doing speciality electronics and engineering, Dover (DOV), Illinois Toolworks (ITW)...

This style of business has outperformed the S&P by a pretty wide margin over the past 20 years. These companies also tend to be diversified across a variety of businesses and sectors.

The downside is that you rarely get to buy in for "cheap" and the earnings multiples are a bit rich at the moment.

(For those just looking for a ticker, of these choices I think ROP, VNT, and ITW have the most attractive valuations at the moment, but do your own research).

TLDR Pretend any one of these companies was an ETF, chart it against the S&P 500, then tell me you don't like that performance... And because it's based on a culture and internal process to the business, I think there's a better-than-average chance they can repeat that.

* Affirm priced its shares at $49 apiece, above its target range of $41 to $44 each.
* The stock began trading at $90.90 per share.

Shares of payments company Affirm soared more than 103% in its initial public offering on the Nasdaq, kicking off what‚Äôs likely to be a busy season for market debuts.

The stock began trading at $90.90 per share. Affirm had priced its shares at $49 apiece, above its target range of $41 to $44 each.

Founded in 2013 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm has become prominent in the ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù space that offers point-of-sale loans. The company allows customers to finance online purchases that can be paid back in monthly installments without accruing compounding interest. 

It works with around 6,500 retailers, including Peloton, Wayfair, Walmart and direct-to-consumer eyeglasses company Warby Parker. In an update to its IPO filing, Affirm said it is used by more than 6.2 million people. Affirm also partnered with Shopify last year, allowing merchants to offer installment loans on products they sell.

Affirm brought in roughly $510 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended on June 30, a 93% jump from last year, according to its filings. In the three months ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 98% year over year, while net losses fell by roughly half to $15.3 million.

Affirm makes money when it helps a merchant make a sale. It also earns interest income on loans it buys from bank partners and some consumer loans. The rate it charges varies by consumers‚Äô creditworthiness, but often starts at 0%.

‚ÄúOur goal is to be a viable alternative to credit cards,‚Äù Levchin told CNBC ahead of the company‚Äôs first trade.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co were the lead underwriters for the offering. Major investors include Peter Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Funds.

Affirm‚Äôs market debut could mark another successful venture for Levchin, who owns 27.5 million shares in the online lender. Following PayPal‚Äôs sale to eBay in 2002, Levchin started the social application company Slide. That sold to Google in 2010 for a reported $182 million. 

Affirm, which trades under the symbol AFRM, has made CNBC‚Äôs Disruptor 50 list twice.

I am posting here today with a question for the more experienced real estate folks.

My good friend and I (Both 24 years old) have done exceptionally well in the stock market the last two years and have recently been looking into real estate.

We are considering purchasing a beach front condo for 500-600K (each paying 10% of the down payment). The plan would be to hire someone to manage the property and rent it out all year. The idea is that this would pay the mortgage and maybe a little bit of passive income at the end of the day. My question is; does this seem like a good idea? It seems like a great investment, however, I have learned anything that seems too good to be true usually is. Has anyone had experience with this? What are your thoughts and or suggestions? We would not really be using this property for us to vacation. The goal would be full rental property and make passive income and later down the road hopefully sell at a higher price than we purchased and re-invest.

Any thoughts and comments would be appreciated! Thank you all and happy new year :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If two stocks have a high historic correlation, what makes one a better choice over the other?

[Affirm Holdings Inc Stock Price (AFRM) - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/equities/affirm-holdings)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Technical Analysis Series (2): Horizontal Support/Resistance, Confirmation Candles, and Volume  Hey Gang,

  
Today I bring to you the second installment of the Technical Analysis Series: Horizontal Support/Resistance, Confirmation Candles, and Volume. Check out my profile for the first post on candlesticks if you are interested in this type of content and missed it (it's one of my pinned posts). As previously mentioned, this series is geared towards the new trader who is trying to learn a bit about technical analysis. 

  
I would classify this installment as a "super installment", because a new trader can make great progress towards profitability and consistency by mastering these core concepts.  I have been technical trading for a little over eight years now and I still use these concepts for every chart I look at and trade I put on.  The reason I grouped these three concepts into one post is because they all operate together in order to be correctly applied.  So let's get into it.

  
**Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance**  
Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance are horizontal levels on price that technical traders and algorithms will identify as areas of interest for buying support or selling resistance. As time progresses and these horizontal levels get tested more and more, they take on increased relevance as key areas of interest on an asset.  Furthermore, once a resistance level is breached it will often be tested (wicked down into and bought up) and thereafter turn into support if upward momentum is to continue. Conversely, support will turn into resistance when the asset is trending to the downside.  For my personal trading, these historical support/resistance levels take on even greater significance when they line up with major moving averages, high volume nodes, and/or Fibonacci levels (concepts that will be explored in future posts).

  
For those that missed the candlestick post, here is a crash course in what I'm talking about regarding wicks: [https://imgur.com/gallery/V9YLjN9](https://imgur.com/gallery/V9YLjN9)

  
Here is a very zoomed out chart of Disney on the 3 day candle timeframe to illustrate horizontal support and resistance. There are quite a few more relevant support/resistance levels present on this chart, but I wanted to keep it clean so it's easier to analyze.

  
The 3 day Disney Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/fUxHC6Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/fUxHC6Y) 

  
The arrows on the chart highlight when these historical support/resistance levels are tested. As you can see along the bottom of the chart, this chart covers price action on DIsney from April of 2013 all the way to the present.

  
The "historical" nature of these horizontal support/resistance levels is emphasized in the following shot, where you can see that price levels from five or six years prior are still getting play and being respected by the market: [https://imgur.com/gallery/HbfcN5v](https://imgur.com/gallery/HbfcN5v)

**General info on Horizontal Support/Resistance**

* Horizontal Support/Resistance levels work on pretty much any timeframe, however they will have more consequence, and be respected more, on higher time frames.
* I generally apply historical support resistance levels off of the candle bodies (see candlestick post if you don't know what a candle body is). This is because price can wick over and under a historical price level, but if not closed over by a candle body I do not consider the historical horizontal broken (this ties in with confirmation candles which will be discussed shortly).

**Testing a Horizontal Support/Resistance**  
A close friend and mentor of mine explained technical analysis to me as the *art* of technical analysis, and this is a concept that has always stuck with me. Using these methodologies is not a science, and often a little bit of instinct and/or experience will make a big difference. Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance levels can and will be front run (i.e. bought up before the horizontal support/resistance) and/or overextended (i.e. sold or bought past the horizontal support/resistance). You do not always get a pixel perfect tap of that horizontal line. In the words of my buddy, "Close enough is close enough." As will be further explained shortly, confirmation candle methodologies and volume analytics can be extremely useful when dealing with these types of close calls.For example, here is an example of where the major Historical Support level of Disney was front run. This can happen for a lot of reasons, and in this case I would say it was front run (not by much, only around $1.00) because it was such a good buy opportunity from a risk/reward perspective.

 Nevertheless, I usually consider these wicks down to still count as tests of this Historical Support level. Close enough is close enough: [https://imgur.com/gallery/HpuU3ur](https://imgur.com/gallery/HpuU3ur)

  
Two main takeaways/solutions for this type of price action that don't quite make it to the horizontal are:

1. A trader can layer bids slightly above, on, and slightly under a horizontal in order to spread out the average price of entry, and therefore catch at least part of this price action.
2. A bounce or rejection off a horizontal like this, even if it doesn't tap the horizontal straight on, can be taken as a sign that the level is being respected by the market.

**Horizontal Support/Resistance w/ Liquidity Zone**

* Depending on the price action being analyzed, you can in some instances apply a second horizontal on the candle wicks, and this creates what is known as a "liquidity zone"  between the candle body and candle wick.
   * Liquidity zones can be established by prior areas of narrow consolidation that have a lot of historical price activity.
      * The general rule of thumb is that the more price action within a designated range, the more weight that area will carry going forward.
   * A liquidity zone is an area that is wicked into and many bids are filled along this area of interest. Frequently, the price moves away aggressively from these liquidity zones for a variety of reasons that can be succinctly  summarized: not everybody gets to buy the bottom or sell the top. When price does move outside the liquidity zone, it often does so in an explosive fashion.
   * Liquidity zones area a result of market dynamics and institutional order flow. Although beyond the scope of this post, the short version is that it is not a coincidence that liquidity zones are often established in the wicks right on the other sides of these historically significant candle bodies. Large institutions need liquidity to fill their sizable orders and they use the stop-loss orders placed right at the top or bottom of these candle bodies as a source of major liquidity to fill their bids. There is a lot to be said about institutional order flow and it will likely be expanded upon further in a future post. 

For example, here is a major liquidity zone on Exxon established off 2 week candles that has remained an area of interest for over twenty years: [https://imgur.com/gallery/tUsQdRa](https://imgur.com/gallery/tUsQdRa)

  
**Why Horizontal Support/Resistance vs. Diagonals?**  
When technical traders are first starting out, I often see that they love to draw diagonals absolutely fucking everywhere.

  
Their charts often end up looking something like this: [https://imgur.com/gallery/KUn6FIZ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KUn6FIZ)

  
& they start to look like, and probably feel like, this guyüôÇ : [https://imgur.com/gallery/SJQGkhM](https://imgur.com/gallery/SJQGkhM)

  
With a diagonal, especially one drawn out over an extended period, there becomes a wide range of where that diagonal support/resistance really is depending on where you are anchoring the first plot point and whether you are using candle bodies or wicks as the touch points along the diagonal trendline.

  
Diagonal support/resistances are valid and useful, particularly for things like rising channels, however for actual trading I will always see if there is a valid horizontal support/resistance nearby that I can use for risk management.

  
The reason for this is because I start every trade with the assumption that the trade will go against me.  Therefore, I need to know my risk profile for each trade and when the trade will be invalidated. In my experience, a horizontal support/resistance level makes things much easier to know where and when to put on the trade and where and when to take it off if things aren't going your way. In contrast, a diagonal support/resistance level may leave a trader unsure of whether the trade is really over/under that resistance/support level. Frequently, at least for me, this lack of confidence in the diagonal results in not taking the trade off where I originally intended. As a result, when the price moves further against you, the original risk profile for your trade is blown and you end up taking a bigger L than you wanted.

  
**Confirmation Candles**  
A confirmation candle is how I tell whether a Horizontal Support/Resistance level has been broken.  
There are two main ways to play confirmation candles and I use both methodologies depending on the current market dynamics I am observing:

1. Close over/under "x" price:
   1. Using this approach you want the candle body to close over or under the Historical Support/Resistance.
      1. Here is an example of Disney Closing over a Historical Resistance: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OxWF4vp](https://imgur.com/gallery/OxWF4vp)
2. Open and close over/under "x" price:
   1. Using this approach you want the candle body to open and close over or under the Historical Support/Resistance.
      1. The benefit of this approach is that it adds further legitimacy to the critical area being breached and further prevents one from buying a "fake out."
3. Regardless of the candle confirmation methodology implemented, a trader still needs to manage the risk on his/her trades. As I have said previously, these tools don't give someone a crystal ball into the future of the markets, they merely provide a statistical edge. Without proper risk management that statistical edge disappears.

**Volume**  
Volume is another important tool that when combined with one of the confirmation candle methodologies above can give a trader increased confidence in his/her decision making around a horizontal support/resistance level and hopefully minimize the frequency of losing trades.   
In general, you want the breach of a Historical Support/Resistance level to be accompanied by above average volume. When high volume accompanies the breaching of a key level it reflects that there is heavy market participation and a lot of action was done on the move. The benefit to above average volume being present during such a move is that it is much more difficult for an institution to be laying a trap during these periods. Further, it reflects that there is wide market consensus that this is the direction the asset should move.

  
The easiest way to tell whether volume is below average, average, or above average is to put a moving average on your volume indicator. I generally use a standard moving average length of twenty on my volume indicators, however I will sometimes adjust this depending on the timeframe or asset being analyzed.

  
Here is an example of volume being an additional confirmation tool on the breach of  a Historical Support/Resistance: [https://imgur.com/gallery/X52HWfQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/X52HWfQ)

  
Conversely, here is how using volume as an additional confirmation tool can keep you out of buying a fake out, even when using the more conservative open and close candle confirmation methodology: [https://imgur.com/gallery/gqBuYCF](https://imgur.com/gallery/gqBuYCF)

  
So, as illustrated by the above examples, Volume can be a very handy tool when used in confluence with Historical Support/Resistance and Confirmation Candles. 

On a final note, the methodologies outlined above can result in a trader missing trades because these approaches are too conservative to allow an entry in all scenarios. However, the markets present constant opportunities and a new trade is around every corner. Personally, I prefer to stick to rules such as those outlined in this post so that I can live to trade another day. Everyone is a genius trading savant in a bull market, but these tools may help a trader stay in the game when the tide turns. I hope this was helpful to all the new traders out there interested in technical analysis!  


Follow my profile if you wish to stay abreast of future installments in this series._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NGAB.U Hello all. I want to prelude my following text as that I am very new to investing. My question for the seasoned veterans of the market is what gives with stock tickets? I wanted to buy NGAB, a new SPAC which promotes sustainability, which is now a larger proponent of the consumer mind set. However, the ticker for this new stock according to stockanalysis.com is NGAB.U. Yet when I search it on either TD America trade or Robinhood, I get a blank search result. So, what am I doing wrong here? Is there a platform which I don‚Äôt have which would make this easier? Thank you for your comments, advice, time, and general discussion. 

This is the link to the article I used to gather my information from. https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/ngab/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bayesian Portfolio Optimisation: Introducing the Black-Litterman Model [https://hudsonthames.org/bayesian-portfolio-optimisation-the-black-litterman-model/](https://hudsonthames.org/bayesian-portfolio-optimisation-the-black-litterman-model/)

The Black-Litterman (BL) model is one of the many successfully used portfolio allocation models out there. Developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman at Goldman Sachs, it combines Capital Asset Pricing Theory (CAPM) with Bayesian statistics and Markowitz‚Äôs modern portfolio theory (Mean-Variance Optimisation) to produce efficient estimates of the portfolio weights.

Markowitz‚Äôs work on Modern Portfolio Theory was groundbreaking in the world of asset allocation, eventually earning him a Nobel prize for his work in 1990. However, after years of research, investors have identified some major shortcomings of MPT:

1. **High Input Sensitivity:** MPT relies on the past performance of the market (returns and covariance matrix) to get an estimate of the portfolio holdings in the current market conditions. A big problem with this approach is that the performance of the past never provides a guarantee for the market situations that arise in the future. Small estimation errors in the past data leads to highly erroneous mean-variance portfolios.
2. **Highly Concentrated Portfolios:** The mean-variance procedure is found to be greedy and generates highly concentrated portfolios with only a few securities receiving the majority of allocations.
3. **Neglecting Investor Knowledge:** Finally, mean-variance optimization does not take into account an investor‚Äôs personal knowledge of the market conditions and intuition. In my opinion, this point can be considered to be the most important of the previously listed points. Rather than just relying on historical data, the models should also incorporate an investor‚Äôs own views of the market which is a very important asset. MVO, instead, chooses to use only historical data with a neglect for valuable market knowledge.

Reasons like the above and the underperformance of MPT in general enticed researchers to start looking for ways to improve it and come up with better models that can be used practically. The BL algorithm is one such model and although it has its own set of drawbacks, there are some unique features that make it an important part of a quant‚Äôs toolkit.

This article from [Hudson and Thames Quantitative Research](https://hudsonthames.org/) explores the intuition and math behind the BL model. Finally it also presents a practical analysis of the model in action by replicating the results of the original paper.

The Black-Litterman model is available as a Python implementation in PortfolioLab, a libary dedicated just for portfolio optimisation - [https://hudson-and-thames-portfoliolab.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/](https://hudson-and-thames-portfoliolab.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Doordash Value Any reason why DoorDash is up almost 50% in the last week?

This is confirmed by Gartner (independant researcher) as it has been leading the magic quadrant for hyperconverged infrastructure for 4 years straight!

This all while their nearest competitor VMware (nr. 2 in Gartner‚Äôs magic quadrant) is valued at a whopping 55 billion. Also Nutanix puts more than 40% of their revenue into R&D whereas VMware only puts 23% into R&D.

In my opinion it‚Äôs only a matter of time untill people discover how great their product actually are, and I‚Äôm surprised this hasn‚Äôt happened already. The company I work for will soon double their Nutanix stack and I will be watching with great interest.

‚ÄúGME‚Äôs board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. ‚ÄúWhile I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question ‚Äì did long buying lead to short covering\squeeze or short covering\squeeze lead to long buying?‚Äù

Dusaniwsky believes it‚Äôs the former.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lion Electric: Who they are and why they should be of interest to you. Long DD post. #I warn you that this will be quite the long read, but one that you will hopefully thank me for.


Another day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.


Awesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**

Today, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:

#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)

It is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. 

**That‚Äôs right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric. For anyone who wants to better understand SPACs, I highly recommend a quick search on Investopedia.** 

Let me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. 

#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.](https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf)



#*So why haven't I heard about this "Lion Electric" company?*

Simple answer: it's a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of America or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are great, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).



#*So, why should I care?* 


**Because Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care.** 


News silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a slimy PR team. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). 

**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** 

And, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)

#*And what about Joe Biden?* 

**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**

NO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Their client from Twin Rivers Unified School District went as far as labelling Lion's electric buses as the **[Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&t=45s). 

I‚Äôm sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion's past the year 2021, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) 


**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**

Anyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.



#*Why should I be buying NOW?*

**Because today may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**

Jim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TODAY most likely](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump Lion to the best of abilities on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. 

**How do I know $NGA will get pumped so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure quite a few of you won't understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will wreak havoc in the market. 

**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**

It revolves around Beta and Fair Value. I'm looking to see what you guys think of it, whether its good or bad, your experiences with something similar, or any general ideas about it. It may sound confusing but I can try my best to simplify it. Thanks!

The theory of High Beta and Fair Value is regarding a stock that you invest in that has a beta higher than that of the market (>1.00) but generally a stock with one, for example, around or over 2.00. This also has to be a stock that you have done a valuation on, using a dividend discount model or free cash flow model, or any other way you applied a value to the stock price. If you know about fair values then you know you invest in stocks that are "significantly undervalued" and you invest in them with hopes that the price rises to your assessed fair value. 

Well, the theory states that when you hold a stock with a high beta, say 2.00, that you will be achieving those returns on your stock until the stock price reaches it's fair value. When it reaches it's fair value, you assume that the growth has been captured and the stock is no longer worth holding because now even if the market goes up, your stock is at it's fair value and there's no fundamental reasons to assume it's stock price will continue up with the market. BUT, on the other hand, if the market were to go down, you would still be acknowledging your high beta negative returns, creating a high risk situation. 

Basically, this is saying that when you invest in a stock that is undervalued, with a high beta, you should only hold that stock until it reaches it's fair value then sell it, even in a bull market. If the stock reaches the fair value and you remain holding it you are now in a High Risk-Low Reward situation -> acknowledging all the high beta negative return and acknowledging no high beta positive return because the stock is where it was valued fundamentally.

[Visual](https://ibb.co/4s9rbqT) - this displays a price graph of the stock with a high beta(1.75 here) and a price graph of the "market". It has 2 scenarios, the green scenario is when the market increases, the red scenario is when it decreases. It also has a brown cross at the point in which we assume the stock has reached it's fair value, it helps you see how the price and market move after the stock has reached that point._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying at the ATH/FOMO  I heard today that more often than not, a stock produces the best gains when people buy at its current all time high. I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should the Fed/Treasury start investing/keeping reserves in foreign currencies? I don't mean to sound like a $ doomster, just seems like something worthwhile to think about.

That being said, $'s share in global trade AND international debt (raised by foreign commercial and government entities) is falling and I don't really see a u-turn on the horizon.

[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/visa-abandons-takeover-of-plaid-after-doj-raises-antitrust-concerns.html)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did the COVID crash cause a bubble? This is just a hypothesis, and I have no way of proving that it is true.

Since the crash in March 2020, the market has roared to new ATHs. Companies with no actual products are going up 50% a day. EV car companies selling 5000 units a year have outrageous marketcaps. IPOs are doubling or tripling within days. To be frank, it reminds me a lot of the 2017 crypto bubble when every shitcoin and scamcoin was doubling every day.

Now hear me out - I think that the COVID crash may have caused a gigantic bubble.

I think many people were expecting a market crash before COVID hit and held off on buying any equities. When I browsed reddit, 4chan, and other boards, you had loads of people in 2019 saying the market crash was imminent and that they would enter the market when it happened. The downturn that happened in March gave these people the perfect excuse to enter the market. I also think that these same people no longer believe that a crash is coming anytime soon, because we just had one last year. Now, all my friends and coworkers, who aren't into stock-picking and finance, are talking about which stocks to buy and throwing every last cent into NIO or XPEV. They, too, think that the market crash has already happened and now we're on another 10-year bull run.

It sounds insane, but could it be possible that the COVID crash made people way too over confident in the markets? Historically, crashes made people frightened, with the markets recovering after several years, but the speed of the recovery since the COVID drop has me wondering if I'm onto something. Maybe the youtubers and finance gurus reminding millennials to "buy every dip" is to blame.

I can't prove my hypothesis, but is there anyone here who thinks the same way?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MARA UPDATE I wrote a previous post about MARA, which can be seen here [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kprml7/mara/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kprml7/mara/) 

The main criticism of the post was that, as the price of bitcoin increases and bitcoin mining becomes more profitable, more and more miners will come online for a piece of the profits. If they do so, the network hashrate will increase, which will lead to the bitcoin mining difficulty adjusting upwards. This means that, following the bitcoin mining difficulty adjusting upwards, a mining organization won‚Äôt be able to mine as many BTC after the adjustment as they were able to before the adjustment (assuming a mining organization‚Äôs hash power stays static before and after the adjustment).

Essentially, this means that, as more miners come online, a mining organization will need more miners themselves to be able to mine the same amount of BTC as before. And it is true.

However, assuming that, as a result of the above, BTC mining is not a profitable business is not an assumption that can be made.

This is because the price of BTC also effects a miners revenue (price of BTC x # of BTC mined = revenue).

Right now, MARA has purchased (but not fully deployed) 103,000 miners. These 103,000 miners can produce 11,000,000 TH/s, which is equivalent to \~7% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate of \~150,000,000 TH/s ([https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)).

This means that, if all of MARA miners were deployed today, MARA would be able to mine \~60 BTC/day (7% of 900 BTC that can be mined per day).

So, with today‚Äôs BTC price of $35K, that means, at the current network hash rate, MARA could mine $2.1mm/day (60 BTC x $35k/BTC). Per year, this equates to $766mm.

Now, we have to take into account that the network hashrate/bitcoin mining difficulty will increase. BTC hashrate has increased by 50 million TH/s the last (3) years. ([https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)) 

So let‚Äôs say that at the end of 2021, the network hashrate is 200,000,000 TH/s (50 million increase over current network hash rate of 150,000,000). That means MARA‚Äôs mining power will be equivalent to 5.5% of the total bitcoin network hashrate (11,000,000/200,000,000).

This means that we can estimate that MARA will be able to mine \~50 BTC per day. At today‚Äôs prices, that would mean $638mm in BTC per year.

However, if BTC increases to $50k, that means $900mm in BTC per year. If BTC increases to $100k, that means $1.8billion in BTC per year.

The above assumes that the network hashrate will only increase by 50 million TH/s this year, which I believe is fair considering it has done that the last (3) years.

MARA‚Äôs current market cap is $1.5 billion as of this post. If BTC reaches $100k, it has the potential to do more than its current market cap in revenue in a year. 

As noted above, if BTC is $100k, that could mean $1.8b in BTC revenue/year. If the market puts 5x sales value on MARA, that‚Äôs $9b market cap. If the market puts 10x sales value on MARA, that $18b market cap.

Overall, given the above, IF Bitcoin continues to increase in price, I believe it is fair to say that Bitcoin mining will be profitable a business. Also, this analysis doesn‚Äôt even take into account the balance sheet increase that MARA would experience if BTC increased in price (for the BTC that MARA mined and held on its balance sheet as BTC).

&#x200B;

**TLDR** Bitcoin continuing to increase in price will validate MARA‚Äôs business model, and MARA will go to the moon

To me 2020 was an amazing opportunity that I was fortunate enough to take advantage of due to my current financial situation.

Second prediction: STPK has reached its top justifiable value ($37.71/share) for the next 12 months, as any further run-up represents either bubble/speculation or unprecedented long-term market valuation. 

Long-winded DD below. 

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------

&#x200B;

STPK is going to become STEM, and ACTC just announced a merger to become PTRA. Using to-the-minute market caps for both, as well as 2021 projected sales totals for the new companies, and then running them against some clean energy/EV comps, STPK's runup over the last week has gotten it to the higher end of what the current market says its 2021 sales should be valued at, and ACTC has got some serious room to run. 

# STPK

With 2021 sales projected at $147 million, and STPK's current shares outstanding accounting for a 28.3% ownership stake in the new company, STPK's market cap stands at $1.45bn, based on 12 January after-hours trading price per share of $37.71. With STEM's projected 2021 topline revenue of $147 million, that puts STPK's P/S ratio at 34.4. 

# ACTC

Proterra's projected 2021 revenue is $246 million. Its actual 2019 revenue was $181 million, and it's projecting $193 million for 2020. Using the current ACTC market cap of only $657.68 million, that gives us a P/S ratio of 3.4 using 2020 sales, or 2.7 using 2021 sales. 

# MARKET COMPS

Since ACTC is selling actual commercial electric vehicles, its high-end market comps are NIO and TSLA, so I'm not going to both pointing out that those are slightly higher than 3.4 P/S ratio. On its low end, comps are FSR and HYLN, whose P/S ratios are infinite because they don't actually sell anything yet. 

Best middle ground I can figure, which even accounts for the uncertainty of being contingent on the completion of a pending merger (this forum auto-deletes the descriptive 4-letter S-acronym, as I learned the hard way the first time I wrote this post) is CCIV/Lucid. Unfortunately, information on its revenue projections is hard to find, as it doesn't appear they've yet filed a prospectus with the SEC. According to this link which seems sort of sketchy, its "estimated" annual revenue is $378.5 million, which puts it at a current P/S ratio of 9.7. 

I can't find the link/source now, but while researching this post I saw a 2019 revenue of $40 million, which puts Lucid at a P/S ratio closer to 100 using 2019 revenue.) Compare this to ACTC's P/S ratios of 3.6 (using 2019 revenue), 3.4 (2020) and 2.7 (2021), and you see why I'm so confident this will double. Also, the fact that Proterra has actually already been generating real revenue for more than a year gives its projections more credibility than the sketchy numbers we have to dig up on Lucid. 

STPK is a unique company that does something no one else in the market does. In addition, its TAM is estimated at $1.3 trillion. Therefore, comparing it to any competitor needs to be taken with a grain of salt. With that said, here are the P/S ratios for trending clean energy names, with STPK placed into context. (Remember that this is only using projected 2021 earnings for STPK, but current MRQ or MRY earnings for its competitors, meaning STPK is likely well above its already high level.) 

PLUG: 52.9  
ENPH: 37.7  
STPK/STEM: 34.4  
RUN: 14.04  
SEDG: 12.02  
Many many others: below 10

Considering that this is using 2021 for STPK and the past for the others, it's safe to assume that STPK is actually in PLUG's ballpark right now, which is why I'm saying it's risky for you short-term, paper-handed big gains chasers. Given its technology and capacity to be a complete game changer for electricity infrastructure over the next ten years, anyone who currently or plans to hold for at least a year or 4 would be well served to buy in now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any apps which provides financial ratios of companies?

Snorkel Dawg needs some investing advice, so please help! One of my fellow dawgs ‚Äî we‚Äôll call him/her Cocoa ‚Äî has presented me with the idea of taking out a $10,000 loan at 3.5% apr 

Cocoa is exploring ways to turn this loan around, and is specifically interested in passive income as Cocoa is hard at work during the day and can‚Äôt actively manage his/her investment. Cocoa brought up the idea of dumping all $10,000 into a high dividend yielding ETF like WDIV mentioned above. 

The way I understand this is that ‚Äî at years end ‚Äî Cocoa will have paid back the $10,000 loan plus $350 in interest, and will have made $626 in dividends (Cocoa and I also understand that the value of the underlying stocks should be factored in as well, but we are bullish so let‚Äôs assume the stocks don‚Äôt lose money through the year). 

In this scenario Cocoa makes a positive $276 after interest and dividends are paid. Can someone please explain if this logic is correct and what is Cocoa missing when considering taking out this loan that he/she should consider? 

I tried to tell Cocoa to just look into Margin trading, but it wasn‚Äôt sinking in. Please help Cocoa understand that this is a bad idea in a way that I couldn‚Äôt!

üì∑[George Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hudson)

As with other [bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble), the Railway Mania became a self-promoting cycle based purely on over-optimistic speculation. As the dozens of companies formed began to operate and the simple unviability of many of them became clear, investors began to realise that railways were not all as lucrative and as easy to build as they had been led to believe. Coupled to this, in late 1845 the Bank of England put up interest rates. As banks began to re-invest in bonds, the money began to flow out of railways, under-cutting the boom.

The share prices of railways slowed in their rise, then leveled out. As they began to fall, investment stopped virtually overnight, leaving numerous companies without funding and numerous investors with no prospect of any return on their investment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Option short-ling term gain taxes I already searched many sites but I dont have any answers that I want.
