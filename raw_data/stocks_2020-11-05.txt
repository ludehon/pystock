* The S&P 500 increased +1.95% today while the NASDaq added (+2.56%). The Russell 2000 rose by (+2.8%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+1.94%)
* All sectors ended in positive territory today. The best performing sector was Materials(+4.08%) while Energy(+0%)was the worst performer.
* Presumably, the market remained pleased by the prospect of a divided Congress, meaning it would be difficult to pass new legislation like higher taxes. Regarding the presidential election, there was still no projected winner, but former Vice President Biden led President Trump 253-214 in the delegate count, according to The New York Times. 
* In addition, the bullish price action likely exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains, particularly among investors who sold the market last week. Today's advance increased the S&P 500's weekly gain to 7.4% after falling 5.6% last week. 
* Separately, there were no surprises in the FOMC policy statement or Fed Chair Powell's press conference. The fed funds rate was left unchanged as widely expected. Mr. Powell said the current pace of asset purchases remained appropriate for the current situation but added that the voting committee discussed options if more accommodation is needed. 
* Treasury yields were subdued all session following yesterday's rally in longer-dated tenors, which was another supporting factor for growth stocks. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.78%.

Stocks kept rallying today, extending this week’s gains, as market participants closely monitored the outcome of the US presidential election, which currently hangs in the balance with several key states still counting the votes. The surge in mail-in ballots this year caused this delay in vote-counting.

The market has rallied strongly at the likelihood that the White House and Senate will be split, meaning one is Republican and the other Democrat. While a split government would likely reduce the size of a new stimulus bill, it greatly lowered the odds that any new regulation or policy change from the Democrats could be passed.

Stephanie Miller, managing director of Fiscal Note Markets, said, ““What Wall Street wants more than everything is for nothing to happen in Washington. There is so much of a bias for a static policy environment – that you can actually make business decisions and have those decisions hold the test of time beyond a couple of years. And so more gridlock in Washington tends to be better.”

Several key swing states, most notably Nevada and Pennsylvania, have yet to finish tallying their votes. As of the time of writing, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump’s 214, according to the Associated Press. Biden only needs Nevada’s 6 electoral votes for victory. Candidates need 270 electoral votes in order to win the election. Results below are taken from the Associated Press.

* **States called for Trump**: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas
* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.

In the Senate, the “blue wave” Democrats were hoping form didn’t materialize. Democrats look like they are going to net just a single new seat in the Senate, leaving a high likelihood that Republicans maintain control. In Georgia, both Senate seats up for election this year could head to runoff contests in January, based on results in the state as of Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

Republican Sen. David Perdue held 50% of the vote Thursday morning. If that tally ends up below the 50% mark, he'll face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff on Jan. 5 in a runoff. The other Georgia Senate seat contested between GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, already appears headed to a runoff next year. The races could play an important role in the makeup of the new Senate, though Republicans are likely to keep their majority.

In an unfortunate note, the US again broke the record for new daily coronavirus cases with 100,000 new cases yesterday. Fifteen states set new daily records for infections Thursday, including Missouri, Washington, Nebraska, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Iowa and North Dakota, according to data tracked by The Post.  Eleven states — including Iowa, Missouri, West Virginia, North Dakota, Nebraska, Idaho, Oklahoma and Minnesota — reported record numbers of patients hospitalized with covid-19, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.

The Federal Reserve held short-term borrowing rates near zero in a decision Thursday that characterized the economy as growing but not near where it was before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

It now serves areas in China, Germany, Hong Kong, the UK, and the U.S. Secondly, Chung highlighted strengthening gross processing margins, high margin visibility, and battery cost reductions. Further, Nio has reported a jump in sales. The company delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, an increase of 100% year-over-year. In 2020, deliveries jumped to 31,430 vehicles, which is a 111.4% spike compared to last year.

The market crash caused by COVID-19 allowed investors many opportunities to buy strong companies at low valuations. The S&P 500 has now rallied almost 60% since the March bottom and value has become significantly harder to find in a market where high valuations are king. Retail investors have turned to struggling companies in the airlines, cruise lines, and hospitality industries. Many of these companies have a very real bankruptcy risk and are not good candidates for value investing.

However, there are still strong companies that are fundamentally undervalued due to the Pandemic, primarily in the financials sector. One such company is [Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS)]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/GS).

#**Description**

Goldman Sachs is an investment banking firm in the capital markets industry. The Company’s trading business accounts for approximately [60% of revenue]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-results/trading-becomes-a-plus-for-goldman-once-again-during-coronavirus-rout-idUSKCN21X1M1), making the company less susceptible to decreased revenues from low-interest rates. The Company also is involved in consumer banking and asset management. Goldman plans to further expand into these two categories, [especially digital consumer banking]( https://fintechranking.com/2020/07/23/inside-goldmans-product-roadmap-for-digital-bank-marcus/). 
Goldman’s most obvious competitor is Morgan Stanley, who [recently acquired E*TRADE]( https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-closes-acquisition-of-e-trade).

#**Valuation**

Ticker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|Fwd P/E|PEG|P/B|Div
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
GS|Goldman Sachs|68.41B|10.97|8.22|1.27|0.89|2.53%
MS|Morgan Stanley|93.02B|8.68|10.09|2.34|1.01|2.72%

Goldman Sachs shows clear potential as a value play with a P/B under 1. Its PEG of 1.27 shows future earnings expectations are reasonably priced, compared with the sector average of 2.32. Goldman’s trailing P/E comes in at 10.97, with a sector average of 18.22. 

Goldman pays a sustainable dividend of 2.53% with a payout ratio of 27.70%. The dividend yield follows the sector average of 2.21%. 

The average price target for Goldman is $255, with a current price of $202. Analysts are expecting upside of over 25%. These metrics indicate Goldman is a strong value buy.

Valuation data sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com/) and [Finviz](https://finviz.com/).

#**Outlook**

Goldman recently beat third-quarter estimates, with $9.68 EPS instead of the predicted $5.57. The beat was primarily due to gains in their bond trading and asset management businesses. The trading division of Goldman Sachs saw a 29% increase in revenue from the same quarter last year.

This strong earnings beat shows that Goldman is less impacted by low interest rates when compared with primarily consumer banks. Goldman Sachs can focus on its core businesses of trading and investment banking operations, without losses in consumer and business loans having a significant impact on revenue.

Furthermore, Goldman has recently started to expand its FinTech presence with Marcus. Through Marcus, Goldman provides [high-yield online savings accounts, personal loans, and financing through MarcusPay]( https://www.marcus.com/us/en). Goldman’s entry into the space will likely serve as a positive catalyst for future growth.

Q3 rev: $59.94 million v \~61 million in 2019

Slightly reduced guidance for Q4_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why hasn’t my stock went up? I am brand new to stocks, and honestly it’s a bit intimidating how much there is to learn about them.

I bought $100 worth of shares back in September, and they’ve announced new lines of CPUs and GPUs since then. Both products are top of the line, and they released the CPUs for sale now, and are releasing the GPUs for sale in a few weeks.

I looked into long term investing stocks and recently bought 11.365 shares in Tesla @ 410, 58 shares of Palantir @ 9.99 and 28 shares of NIO @ 27.42. I've been watching my account grow, and seeing how my money is working for me is becoming very addictive. I'm obsessed actually.

I was wondering as to how I can make a living off of this. Yes I will most certainly do much research on this topic but was wondering if anyone in here could help me or guide me in the right direction. My plan is to have a 5000$ account , study stocks on the weekend, any stocks that have recently had good news or if I see them sitting at a known area of resistance/support I will buy/sell the stock and hold it for the week. Then close whatever profit I make on the Friday and withdraw it, leaving the 5000$ in the account of course.

I practiced this on a demo account last week with 3 stocks I researched and liked the look of . NIO, PLTR and LMND. I pretended to buy 2361$ (2000€)  worth of NIO and Palantir and 1,179$ worth of LMND since that was the one i was less confident with. 5900$ dollars invested and if I had've closed today I would've made upwards of 1700$ this week.

Was this just a lucky week? Or is this something that I can actually do. 

Any advice/guidance would be hugely appreciated.

I think it would very useful to understand why, on a certain week, a stock or sector moved a lot. My idea is that by understanding what made them move we could pay more attention to warning signs as they happen next time.
Does anyone know of such thing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short UBER at close. Good or talk me out of it? Exactly that

Most every other meme-tech stock has dropped bricks right after earnings, even including those that actually beat earnings by good numbers. There have been exceptions (Hi $SNAP!) but those have been growth companies and not established ones.

UBER has earnings after the bell AND has rallied almost 15% the last two sessions. I expect quite a big correction after hours.

Current plan is I buy ATM 11/20 or 11/27 calls which are going for $2 right now, stay for earnings call and either quickly short after the announcement, or let the calls ride.

Worst case is the stock doesn't move at all (or less than $2) and then I'm down $200 per call contract, but even then I'm buying myself 2/3 weeks time to move those $2.

Opinions?

Here's what's running around my head at the moment:

1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.
2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.
3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.
4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.
5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.
6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an "everything is great, pile into the markets" sentiment.
7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.
8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are our thoughts on Cloudflare (NET) earnings after hours today? Cloudflare NET is slated to release third-quarter 2020 results on Nov 5.

Notably, the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) last September. Ever since, it has reported four quarterly earnings. In the last reported quarter, Cloudflare’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 50%.

Management expects third-quarter revenues between $102.5 and $103.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $103.1 million. Notably, the consensus mark for loss has remained unrevised at 5 cents per share for the past 30 days.

Cloudflare’s diversified customer base is anticipated to have aided top-line growth during the third quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the company had more than 3 million free and paying customers. Moreover, it had added roughly 7,000 new paying customers, bringing the total count to approximately 96,000 across more than 160 countries.

Large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000) were 637 at second-quarter end, up from the 536 recorded at the end of the first quarter. The company’s large customer base witnessed a CAGR of 80% during the 2016-2019 period. This momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well on elevated demand for its cloud-based solutions amid the pandemic-led remote-working wave.

Further, Cloudflare’s recurring subscription-based business model provides relative stability to its top line despite the COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions.

Additionally, solid demand for security solutions, which became imperative due to aggravated cyberattacks, bring-your-own device policies and a zero-trust approach, is likely to have supported the top line in the quarter under review.

However, Cloudflare’s significant exposure to small and medium businesses (SMBs), the worst-hit cohort by the pandemic, might have impeded growth during the quarter to be reported.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idINKBN27K1YV_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Morning Market Synopsis - Thursday, Nov. 5, 2020 **US equities higher: Dow +2.30%, S&P 500 +2.44%, Nasdaq +2.63%, Russell 2000 +2.31%**

* US equities sharply higher in Thursday morning trading. S&P 500 on track for best weekly performance since early April after coming under pressure last week. Growth extending its election-driven outperformance vs value. Tech one of the best performers with semis and software providing some upside leadership. Materials a standout on fairly broad-based strength with precious metals faring particularly well (big day for gold). Healthcare, REITs among the laggards. Treasuries little changed following their recent bullish flattening move. Dollar under heavy pressure on the major crosses. Gold up 2.7%. WTI up 0.3%.
* Market strength continues to be chalked up to a **split Congress that should translate to the continuation of a favorable tax and regulatory environment**. However, it was not long ago that a bullish narrative had formed around a "blue wave" that could deliver more meaningful fiscal stimulus. That said, **fiscal stimulus is still going to happen** over the near term, likely in the $1T+ range. In addition, the **Fed is now expected to have to do more**, putting some renewed focus on a **growth trade** that has been a longstanding broader market tailwind.
* Despite all the optimism in the market, there **continues to be a lot of uncertainty surrounding the election**. Biden still has a better path to 270 electoral votes than Trump, but the race is tightening in Arizona and Nevada is also close. At the same time, the race in Georgia has also tightened. Outside of the election, **monetary policy** is back in focus with the BOE boosting QE and the Fed policy decision later today. However, not much is expected from the latter. **Initial claims** disappointed modestly ahead of tomorrow's October employment report. **Coronavirus trends** continue to worsen though there continues to be some offset from **vaccine expectations** and AZN-US reiterated it expects data out this year.
* **Very busy on the earnings front** (one of the peak days for Q3 earnings season) and more than 80% of the S&P 500 has now reported. Beat rates have remained at very elevated levels. According to FactSet, \~86% have surpassed consensus EPS expectations and in aggregate, companies reporting earnings more than 19% above expectations. Fundamental takeaways may be complicated to some extent by the recent broader market price action. In addition, a lot of the big themes have already been hashed out and the focus will soon shift to the October quarter reporters, particularly in retail, where the consumer resilience theme will be closely scrutinized.

**Notable Gainers:**

* \+37.8% **UPWK-US** (Upwork, Inc.): Q3 earnings unexpectedly positive with revenue and guidance ahead; analysts noted broad strength as company is benefiting from remote work trend with second consecutive quarter of record net client additions who are spending more than prior cohorts, also GSV growth reacceleration.

* \+8.8% **CAH-US** (Cardinal Health): Fiscal Q1 EPS beat on better sales and margins; Medical business a standout with company flagging cost savings, fairly minimal coronavirus impact and higher lab volumes; raised guidance at the midpoint largely in line with the beat; some talk about low expectations into the print.

* \+4.9% **EXPE-US** (Expedia Group): Q3 EBITDA much better; room nights and revenue also ahead but bookings worse; cost savings and Vrbo the highlights; Street takeaways largely focused on traction behind cost savings efforts and increase in cost savings target; guidance below with trends recently softening; analysts noted not surprising given uncertainty surrounding worsening coronavirus trends.
* \+3.6% **HOLX-US** (Hologic): FQ4 earnings and revenue beat with guidance well ahead; upside led by Diagnostics ( Covid testing); analysts highlighted operating margin beat as Covid tests are high margin and the divestiture of Aesthetics segment helped; testing rates continue to increase including Europe; core businesses performed decently.
* \+2.2% **GM-US** (General Motors): Big Q3 EBIT beat on outsized NA strength; International unexpectedly positive and GM Financial well above consensus; highlighted margin strength from product mix, disciplined pricing and price actions; noted faster than expected sales recovery in US and China with full-size pickups and SUVs the standouts.

* \-5.8% **PAYC-US** (Paycom Software): Q3 results better with focus on new business sales and new client additions; second straight Q of record client bookings; Q4 guide also better; takeaways largely positive but highlighted potential for questions surrounding magnitude of the beat; also some discussion about persistent coronavirus headwinds; stock a big ytd outperformer.

Besides real estate investment stocks and some isolated niches, it's been getting hammered for quite awhile.  

Justification of low prices include stiff competition, lack of profitability, learning curves, relative ease of growing cannabis, legal roadblocks both criminal and financial, fraud, etc.  But my gut tells me there is money to be made here - it's just finding which ones will really hit in the next 2-4 years.  

Decriminalization and eventually legalization will create many winners - that is my general take (along with anecdotal evidence seeing my anti-street drug mother justify CBD and take daily- plus knowing it is better than alcohol & should be legal)

[Just came across this article from Medium about the Big Pharma players](https://medium.com/alphagreen/is-big-pharma-taking-over-the-cannabis-industry-502591232759).  Seems some long shots in there like GW Pharm (GWPRF) and others who could hit on something big and blow up

APHA, CRON, TLRY, CGC are near all-time lows.  While some like Real Estate Financing like IIPR have performed well.  Nice to know Constellation Brands is behind CGC & CRON also gets billions from Altria (MO) - so big beer money wants in, but is it sunk cost now?  Chase good money after bad?  

APHA just announced a $300m purchase of Sweetwater Brewing Company which gave the price a lift yesterday, and seems to have buoyed the sector today.

Also to consider is the unusual bearish option activity showing large calls of CRON at $3.  

And there is much to vet about the executives scheduled stock sale times as that will flood market and drop price

Apple is also more than 20$ from it’s all time high and has finally broken the down trend that started in October, as it has found a level at around 115$ were I believe will have a lot of support and upside from here. The Rsi also indicates the company is a buy at the moment, far away from overbought conditions. Apple stands to benefit from easing antitrust issues also now, with a big tech brake up a lot less likely now. [Apple Chart](https://ibb.co/sQY33fT)

Yesterday we saw a big jump in most of the stock market, with the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 leading the way up more than 4,4% [Nasdaq CHART](https://ibb.co/TtyYqbg), while the S&P also rose more than 2% [S&P CHART](https://ibb.co/WkPzcH7) and the Industrial heavy dow jones was the laggard only being up 1,3% [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/3zv5Rck) .  The Volatility Index (VIX) or the fear gage in the stock market also saw a huge drop of more than 16%, closing the day under 30 for the first time since the middle of october [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/RpxZ306). There wasn’t to much breath in the stock market though as only 51% of the companies were advancing but we did see a huge difference in new highs vs lows. The average trading volume is still down but I expect that to regain momentum in the next period [CHART](https://ibb.co/T4ZqM8z) . The leaders of the rally yesterday were the Health Care, Communications, technology and consumer discretionary while the laggards were materials, utilities, financials and industrial all being down more than 1% as a hole [CHART](https://ibb.co/n8n05f0) . The momentum and growth stocks especially the large caps were the leaders yesterday as small cap and value plays did suffer [CHART](https://ibb.co/L9H52GR) . Here is a heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/BNp47Cp) of the stock market as The biggest losers yesterday were companie like Caterpillar, Vulcan Materials and united rentals while the biggest winners were the tech companies with the likes of Uber and Lyft which received great news from California as well as Faceook, Paypal and also we saw some great gains from the health sector with United Health and Biogen which had some great announcement for the Alzheimer treatment. 

I was very interested to see what the US crude oil inventories will show yesterday and we have received some great news as the inventories decreased by almost 8 million barrels as they were expected to increase by almost 1 million. That is a huge difference and seems to be pointing to a great restart of the economy with the inventories mostly decreasing since July.  [OIL CHART](https://ibb.co/K2Nysg2)

Today i will closely watch the Fed announces as they still expected to hold the short term rate at a quarter of a percentage

Today we will finally here from Peloton as they will release earnings results with the EPS estimate at 12 cents, I do believe they will beat this and i expect it to be in the same ballpark as last quarter at least. I believe the company will continue to grow especially with the lower priced products becoming available and the subscription based model which provides a very stable recuring revenue stream.

Sorry about rookie question_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you see Upwork moving short/medium term? Hey guys I’m new to this sub and overall very new to trading. After 3 months I’m currently sitting on my best return so far. I bought some UPWK stock a while ago and it just shot up about 25% after hours because of good Q3 earnings. Upwork is a tech company which pairs freelancers with companies similar to Fiverr, big difference is that Upwork is a bit more white collar and offers higher paying, longer jobs overall. I personally think that this type of industry can explode given the current circumstances people are facing professionally/very sudden shift towards remote work. My question is: How do you see their stock moving in the coming weeks/months. They’re showing very good growth over the last year and despite not being profitable (which is extremely normal for a relatively “new” tech company as they’re reinvesting in themselves), financials already look better than Fiverr’s. I understand that Fiverr is overvalued but why isn’t Upwork trading in the same range as them? Fiverr has over double the market cap of Upwork... I’ve already held on to stocks too long, regretting my decision not to sell. Is this sudden growth justifiable and sustainable: Should I be looking to sell at open or hold.

She is generally hard to reach but returns calls within a day or two (if she's not on vacation). Yes I am pulling his assets out of there as soon as I can push the paperwork through. I got a power of attorney & have gotten authorized user status for the account. But it’s going to take a couple of weeks and I feel we should buy in to some stocks that might be a lot more expensive in 2 weeks, because as people who have been sitting out in cash begin to buy back into the stock market, some stocks will become way more expensive.

I’ve picked some stocks that I think shouldn't wait two weeks and want to instruct his broker on what trades to make (if/when we ever connect).

Can someone please review/comment/suggest?

These stocks are picked with the following priorities:

* dividend-yielding U.S. stocks  
* aren't at high-priced pop stocks valuations  
* low downside risk of major declines  
* some short term downside risk is OK  
* out of favor stocks like value stocks is OK  
* these are ones that are better to buy now before they shoot up too high because they're bouncing up (health care), or because they're low & have room to run for recovery (industrial, energy)

Now I have a few questions, and I’m hoping we can get a chat going about what we all think is going to happen with NIO.



1. Do you think stocks will rise after their earnings report on the 17th of November?

- This I am sure about, because their earnings are in some reports, 154% up from the third quarter of 2019. This surely stands the share prices in good stead. 


2. Do you think after NIO day (Jan 21) stocks will  go up? 

- My opinion is yes it will surely shoot up, when they showcase products like the new ET7


3. Do you think at the current price of $37.71, it is too late to purchase? 

- I think not, the future of motor vehicles across the globe is within the EV market. I believe that the likes of NIO, XPENG, and LI AUTO, are all due to surge over the years, due to the innovation and expertise of the Chinese.

2)Would you buy some XPEV now to diversy from NIO or wait for a pull back especially that it lagged last month deliveries which the managment blamed on golden week however it tripled on yearly basis. 

The reason I am saying that is because I believe more analysts will come with a higher XPEV target price leading the stock to rally more than NIO in the short period (which is already happening now)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JD.com rolls out fleet of autonomous delivery vans JD.com is the second largest online retailer in China.

u/wallstreetbets..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When do I sell and reinvest stock gains? The idea crossed my mind to take the profit from my stocks this year and then reinvest that profit back into other stocks. The goal is to use the increased cash to invest back in the market and hopefully grow the portfolio.

For example, let's say I started with 15k in cash. Over two years, my portfolio is up 50% and I've made 10k on stocks. (I've probably put 5k cash in over that two years) Half of the stocks I've had more than a year and the other half less.

I'm wondering if its worth it to sell the stocks, capture the lets say 7k of profits (estimate of how much the profit will be after tax. no clue how much it would be) and then invest it back in the market.

Not trying to time the market- only looking to use the increased cash and reinvest.

Side question- does it make sense to reinvest in some of the same stocks? Most likely would reinvest in new ones that I see more growth potential with. 

This article prompted the idea- [https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/) it talks about taking gains in the 20-25% range.

Bezos has accelerated his stock sales in the last year. In August, Bezos offloaded more than $3.1 billion of Amazon shares, after selling more than $4.1 billion worth of shares in February. The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to more than $10.2 billion so far, which is a notable jump from 2019, when Bezos sold $2.8 billion worth of shares.

Even with the latest stock sale, Bezos still owns more than 53 million shares worth nearly $170 billion, making him the richest person in the world.

The transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings. Amazon declined to comment on the latest sale.

Bezos has previously said he sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year to fund his rocket start-up, Blue Origin. Additionally, the Amazon CEO in February launched a $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change, which will issue grants to scientists, activists and other organizations.

While Bezos hasn't yet announced the recipients of the fund, The Atlantic reported Tuesday that Bezos is expected to give $100 million each to the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund.
