 Why Big Fonds might beat indexes in the future While all arguments against active Fonds, such as fees and bad timing, still stand and will continue to do so I believe that right now and probably for the next 30 years more and more big fonds will start to outperform the market. 

This is due to the rise of marketshare of passive investments. These passive investments are always following active investors and the higher the passive/active ratio is the more passive investors are following fewer active investors.. and thus giving their decisions more weight and power.

One example where we begin to see this is ARKK, the biggest activly managed fond. 

Also I don't see this changing in the near to mid-term future as the passive philosophy is to popular in educated minds._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla Q4 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast I always enjoy calling into the Tesla quarterly webcasts (Elon always seems to spill a few clues of upcoming news).

I know everybody is talking about the next Tech Stock with crazy returns which is perfectly fine but a balanced asset allocation can contain more than just stocks. Investors add Bonds, Real Estate, Precious Metals, Krypto or other assets to diversify. Of course stocks historically had the best returns, but do you really want to see your entire net worth drop by more than 50% for a few years?

Here are some arguments for and against Gold in your asset allocation and how it could perform in the next decade.

Arguments for Gold:

- Negativ real interest rates.
Gold is negatively correlated with real interest rates. Longterm negativ real interest rates would make gold more attractive as an investment and I don‘t think central banks will be able to significantly raise interest rates. This makes gold attractive over bonds to preserve real value.
- Exponential Money Supply.
Most economic crisis are deflationary since consumers and businesses increase savings rate. The increase in money supply could lead to higher inflation when spending and velocity of money increases as the economy recovers. Overall money could become less attractive as supply increases while the supply of gold doesn’t. This leads to my next point.
- Dept Cycles.
We seem to enter the later stage of a debt cycle. Interest rates have constantly decreased over the past 30 years while the debt of governments hast increased. This is not a problem as long as negativ cashflows of payed interest stay roughly the same. So higher government debt is no problem as long as interest rates decrease. The issue is, that this cycle is difficult to break and it doesn’t matter when the next crisis happens but when it does we will have to print even more money than now, decrease interest rates further below zero and hand out more helicopter money, fully embracing MMT. No currency survives forever and the dollar collapsing is possible in our lifetime.
- Central Banks hold massive gold reserves.
Gold is still backing our currencies to some degree as central banks hold gold. If a countries currency faces hyperinflation, gold will be the only thing retaining it’s value. Lots of commodity dependent countries like Russia started to expand gold reserves and China is likely to have way more gold reserves than official as they produce more than they sell.
- No taxes on gold gains.
In most countries there is no tax on gold gains which is often not accounted for when comparing gold performance with other asset classes.


Arguments against gold:

- Economic recovery.
Gold Is generally seen as a save haven and increases in value during recessions. Long bullmarkets make gold less attractive as an investment and it dropped 40% between 2011 and 2015 which was a great time to be in stocks or real estate. Overall gold is way more volatile than people think.
- Increase in bond yields.
Over the past weeks bond yields have increased as expected inflation increased which put pressure on the gold price. Higher bond yields could lead to further drops in the price of gold.
- Gold is a non-productive asset.
Often brought up by Warren Buffet, gold doesn’t do anything for economic output as it just sits around in a safe while companies create value and land can be harvested or built on. 10% of Gold produced has an industrial use but that alone wouldn’t justify the price.
- Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is gaining more and more acceptance as an asset and institutional money is flowing in. Many see bitcoin as an alternative to gold and a preserver of value with better liquidity and higher upside than gold. The market cap of bitcoin is already 1/13 of Gold which is crazy if you compare the short timeframe crypto has existed compared to gold. Capital flows that would otherwise go into Gold get sucked up by bitcoin.

Overall I think there is a strong case to be made for the role of gold in a balanced portfolio. In my opinion at least 10% gold is very reasonable but I can see how some of this could also be allocated to silver or crypto.

Personally I do have a significant amount of gold in my portfolio and it has performed similar to stocks over this particular timeframe (mostly bought in 2016). If you bought gold in 2011 you were less lucky but the same argument could be made for stocks between 2000 and 2010 with zero gains. 

Do you think gold is still relevant as an asset class?

Call options have arguably been a major driver for the market over the last 6 months. These options have helped push prices higher and higher. I recently read that small investors made up 20% of trading vs 15% in 2019. 

This is extremely basic theory, but if people jumped on the bandwagon for gains towards the upside with calls, won’t they do they same with shorts to the downside, which then may be exacerbated lower just as calls took things higher.

Why do I think this? It didn’t take long for people to catch onto Robinhood. Anyone who learned how to make money with a call inevitably knows how to simply buy a put now as well when the time comes. 

Whenever things shift, that same group of people, IF they choose to abandon the upside, may very well go full short mode.

I am even seeing irresponsible advice to beginner investors being given on here, such as advising novices (many who even say they want to avoid high risks) to invest lots of money into these assets. This is so dangerous.

There seem to be so many investors around who don't understand what they are investing in. Some may not even know what a P/E ratio is and how to understand a balance sheet, but they are putting large amounts of money into highly speculative investments.

Few people seem to accept the fact that past returns do not indicate the future of their investments.

I am not saying there is no place for these investments or that there no potential in innovative technology and clean energy etc. but people need to understand the huge valuations they are putting these companies at and the risks involved.

The edition I'm reading was published in the early 1970s when bonds performed roughly 500% better than they do now, the book describes 4-6% returns for bonds. It took me forever to read the chapter because I was in disbelief that the financial situation would change so much ("surely I'm grossly misunderstanding something??" I kept thinking). 

But no, the bonds that yielded a guaranteed 5.1% are now returning 0.1% (series e bonds). The advice to have no less than 25% of your portfolio in bonds seems absurd in 2021. But I still appreciate the historical context of the market, and gave reason why grandparents tell grandchildren to investing bonds.

So I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question or if my vernacular is off.

Context: My Grandfather (God rest his soul) invested $100 into a Series EE bond every year until I was 18. (1992-2010). They have a 30 year maturity rate. From what I understand, they at least double in value after 20 years and the other 10 varies by interest rates.

To me, that sounds like a pretty sad rate even if it's just $100. My question is, wouldn't I be better off by selling some of these (maybe the 10 most matured) if not all of them and transfer that money into my TDF which would garner higher returns? Let me know if more information is needed here to be able to justify this.

Additionally, let's say it is wise to sell these bonds... from my limited research online, cashing these bonds in doesn't seem like a dubious process. However, does anyone have any advice here or a simpler of going about it?

Thank you in advance to all answers!

Edit: Grammer _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Callaway Golf (Ticker ELY) Analysis and Price Target after TopGolf Acquisition Back in October, Callaway Golf Co announced a merger with Topgolf that was valued at $2 billion. For anyone who is familiar with golf or Topgolf's venues, I believe this merger makes ELY's stock very undervalued and I wanted to do some DD and analysis to come up with a reasonable price target. 

Callaway is currently projected to do $1.55B in revenue in 2020 with an expected growth rate of 10.5% for future years while Topgolf will do revenues of about $1.1B while experiencing a 30% growth rate since 2017. This 30% growth can continue for many years to come as the company is still rapidly growing and expanding its venues. Also, over half of Topgolf's customers consider themselves non-golfers so this gives Callaway a huge market to bring in new customers to their golf apparel and equipment revenue streams. Source: [https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/27/topgolf-is-merging-with-callaway-in-a-deal-valued-at-2-billion/](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/27/topgolf-is-merging-with-callaway-in-a-deal-valued-at-2-billion/)

For my analysis, I projected Callaway and Topgolf's revenues out to 2025 with the above mentioned projected growth rates, and came to a combined revenue estimate of $6.63B in 2025. I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. **Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85.**

Thoughts??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What to look for in nano cap stocks? So let me start by saying that I know nano cap stocks are risky and that most of them never go anywhere or worst just go bankrupt.

That being said let’s say someone gave you 1000$ to invest only in nano caps, what would you look for?

I usually first look at what those companies are selling and I make sure it’s something physical I understand.
I stay away for example from pharma companies that may or may not discover the next best drug, or tech companies that are working on the ne t big thing but don’t really have anything to show yet.

After that I look at the books, how much debt do they have, could they pay off those debts tomorrow if they needed to and do they make money (or at least does it look like they are on the right track to make money soon).

Next what’s their competition like and do they have room to grow.

Finally who’s in charge, did they run a company before, how did that go, are they qualified etc...

So that’s my little method but I am not sure it is right one.

I'm tempted to open a relatively small position in this Turkish bank majority owned by Bahraini Al Baraka Banking Group. I was wondering if anybody has any recent experience with investing on the Istanbul stock exchange or can provide any other insight in how safe this is? My main concern is they identify me as a foreign investor and somehow prevent me from selling.

My reasoning behind this idea: I think Turkish banks are well positioned to benefit from internal economic troubles. I wouldn't dare investing in a local company because I don't trust their government at all but I don't think they are willing to risk potential diplomatic problems when they interfere at this Bahraini owned bank.

Lira exchange rates have stabilized and interest rates are at an astonishing 17%. Erdogan is barking at interest rates and banks again, public deficit is on the rise and inflation probably sits somewhere around 15% but I don't expect extreme events because they can't risk further economic problems (as reflected by the fact interest rates where raised recently).

GME is set to default in the next 8 months without further cash infusion.

# Business Model

GME high margins has always been reselling popular titles. They buy low and sell high for popular titles. This has worked in the past but the tipping point had arrived in 2019 \[1\] putting severe pressure in the old business model.

In the next generation console, online purchases will continue to be dominant. Moreover, when popular titles become less popular, they are heavily discounted online, incentivizing consumers to find deals online rather than holding on to physical media.

This compression in its high margin and sharp drop in foot traffic to drive sales will continue to impair cash flow in the future, leading to a solvency problem.

Lastly, the previous console generation had been saturated. It’ll be unsustainable for GME to depend on customer selling and buying previous console titles.

# Competitor Advantage

There has been excitement about Ryan Cohen trying to transform GME to an online business. But the competitor moats are too big to overcome. Microsoft and Sony own game studios and will continue to offer better deals on their online platform. There is no way for GME to compete with these monopolistic moats.

It is important to note that Blockbuster tried to shift online once it realize that Netflix had disrupted its business model. Blockbuster was unsuccessful because of Netflix’s first move advantage, ability to raise large debt, and operate at massive losses at scale to undercut Blockbuster move online.

A similar environment is facing GME as it plans its online pivot. Microsoft and Sony have massive cash reserves and at scale, and lower marginal operating costs compared to GME online business. Moreover, they control studios and can offer their exclusives first buying opportunities on their platforms before sales move to secondary platforms.

# Value Trap

GME has no virtuous cycle. Unlike Blue Apron that was able to improve cash flow because of the pandemic and people buying meal kits, or TSLA improving production and selling more green credits to improve production, GME has no virtuous cycle.

Market analysis indicates there is a structural shift to online buying and online platform to provide heavily discounted prices of popular titles once their popularity wanes.

I will argue that GME business model is similar to Blockbuster after it was disrupted by Netflix. GME is in a death spiral, unable to compete against Microsoft or Sony.

# Cash Flow Problems

GME operating loss in October 2020 was 184M. They had 450M in cash \[2\] at the end of October. This implies a runway of 2-3 quarters in which they need to raise cash or face default.

# Short Squeeze Mania Explained

Much excitement has been made about a possible short squeeze against Melvin Capital. People point to the recent 100% rise in GME to argue for a short squeeze. Much discussion has been made of it so I won’t add to it, except to offer another explanation, focusing on MM and delta hedging.

As rumours about an infinite short squeeze on GME rose, a sharp rise in call option buying occurred. MM as part of their delta hedges would need to buy up shares. However encountering few shares to buy MM started buying ITM calls, and moving to OTM calls. This led to higher prices and MM needing to further buy shares and call options to delta hedge. So the steep rise in price wasn’t from Melvin Capital but MM delta hedging. Furthermore, realizing the risky positions MM had taken as part of delta hedging (imperfect hedges) they decided to eliminate GME margins to slow down the gamma convexity

Therefore it is the MM that had been buying shares and not Melvin Capital. This is supported by the early evidence that Shorts took on more shorts/puts as the price went up.

# Conclusion

GME is at risk of default in 6-8 months and a short squeeze may not come. ***In fact what may be happening is that retails have entered a massive value trap that will cause them to lose most of their investment should GME continue to face a cash crunch on weak sales/massive operating cash flow losses over the next 8 months without a huge cash injection***. Even then their business model is structurally problematic.  **The risk of default is very high but retails are ignoring this in hope of a short squeeze.**

To begin, I've done okay with SAVING but TERRIBLE with investing. Current investments are a 3k portfolio with EJs (soon to closeout and reinvest) and 10k in 401k (3 separate from different employers, each is a target retirement fund) and a hi yield checking (1.5%) at one of my banks. That's the ugly.

I want to invest a significant of the remaining 98k but also have a fairly comfortable amount of cash on hand (20k??? too hi???).

My wife and I both are both 37 years of age, have secure jobs and our household income is \~90k gross.

DCAing VOO/SPY/whatever index is the best low effort way to get rich over time.

Lately I’ve seen countless “it’s a bubble” posts everywhere. Are SPACs a bubble? Yes. Is green energy a bubble? Yes. Are EVs a bubble? 1000% yes. Same with other sectors like marijuana. Frankly, anyone buying longterm positions in a Tesla, Plug Power, Nio, or any of these other companies that had a 1000% run up will be in for a rude awakening on any multiples contraction or sentiment shift. I imagine I’ll get pushback on this, but a company like Nio is priced to perfection with a near $100B market cap while selling a few thousand cars. Interesting to me that people call these companies the future without realizing how much they’re actually paying for these holdings. All that being said, Tesla, Nio, etc could double again this year and I wouldn’t bet against it.

Naturally, there are comparisons to the dot com bubble. “When it pops, you’ll lose 90%!” For the Tesla cult, such as the guy who went viral for quitting his job and just living off of Tesla stock, yeah he’s probably screwed. However, most making the argument about the bubble popping conveniently leave out the people who rode the hype wave up and cashed out.

It took months for the dotcom bubble to fully crash, and investors had countless opportunities to cash out after a 5,10, and even 20% drawdown from the peak. 90% crashes don’t happen overnight, they take time. With 0 commission trading, it’s never been easier to hit the sell button, but people panic and hope that their holdings will rebound. Hopium is certainly dangerous. At some point, buyers will stop coming in, and Nio at $100B market cap will look ridiculous in hindsight.

But right now, there has been and continues to be a lot of money to be made. Talking heads on CNBC calling for reckless trading by the new gen investors are assuming that everyone is just buy and holding for the longterm. 

People who have been riding momentum have made an absolute killing over the last year, while everyone screamed bubble! Valuations will ALWAYS matter in the longterm, but prices can become disconnected from reality for a long time as buyers chase them higher.

It’s easy to sit back and scream “Bubble!” But IF you actively manage your portfolio (again does not apply to DCA gang), I’d imagine you’re a bit salty for missing out on gains. When there’s money to be made, make it. Just don’t forget to sell.

The real issue is the group that thinks all these green energy or next gen companies will take over the world, and they’re buying for the longterm. News flash: if you read through their quarterly reports, most of these companies are overvalued, low margin businesses that are supported by people investing in an idea, not the reality of the company’s financials. Most of these hot sectors are fantastic for trading, but buyer beware for long holders.

Personally, I am fully aware that SPACs are in a bubble like state, but I have been determined to make as much $$$ as possible until market conditions change. Being cognizant of risk and market conditions is important, and I’ve had a fantastic year while keeping my eye on the exit.

In summary, people tend to scream “bubble” when they missed out on the ride. After all, no one would choose less money over more. Longterm investors in bubble sectors will be in for pain if they hold all the way down after a pop, but a ton of money is made on the way up. George Soros once said, “When I see a bubble, I rush in and buy.” Just an interesting thought. At the end of the day, we’re all trying to make money. Not a sin to ride the wave._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on $RKT feb 19 calls? Last close: $19.60Earnings date: 09/2

I know everyone and their dog thinks $RKT is a dead meme stock from the past but this is still the main shark in the mortgage industry, poised for growth with estimated 2020 earnings of around $8 billion dollars giving it a P/E ratio of around 6. News has been scarce but any catalyst could cause a squeeze which would make these options a goldmine.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cloudflare (NET) is currently strongly overvalued Hello all,

This is my $.02 if you are considering investing in cloudflare. What the company has going for it is massive revenue growth, similarly to tesla, and a fantastic service that MIGHT do well for many years to come. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THIS COMPANY WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY COMPANY WITH NO EARNINGS!!!!!!!

However, at the current price, you are paying way too much for this growth and getting ripped off.

I prefer to use P/S for companies that do not make money. NET is currently trading at 60x (yes SIXTY TIMES) its revenue. I personally never invest in a company that has over 20x revenue, but this is just insane. It is a product of the market we are in, and a sign of a bubble. This is a 23 BILLION dollar company making LESS THAN 400 MILLION IN REVENUE.

ROE ROA and ROI are ALL negative for cloudflare.  NET also has a cash flow of -$15m and an EBITDA of -$75m.

&#x200B;

I am in the camp that a market correction will be happening some time soon, and that is why Cloudflare is a HARD pass for me at the current price. Perhaps it could be justified at $35 per share. This is like paying 2-3x for a lamborghini. Yes, it is a lambo, but why would you pay 2-3x when you can get something similar for cheap?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stocks similar to Corsair? My expectations towards the company:

Market cap is between 1-10B or at least below 30-40B

Makes quality products

Already has a decent consumer base and still growing sales/profit

Operates internationally and preferably U.S or EU based

Decent branding, well known company in the industry

&#x200B;

So the only similar stocks what i found is NIU and Fiverr but niu has chinese origins(+risk) and fiverr is really overvalued for me already it has grow 600%+ and it has a 9B market cap with just 100-200M revenue yearly. (only if i found fiverr earlier...)

What other stocks would you recommend?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Finding a reverse merger for a private company. Imagine you are a CEO of a private-owned startup with a next-gen energy tech that will probably make you either a competitor or an acquisition target of Tesla.  Incredible growth potential.

Goal: Reverse merger to get access to public markets, ideally with a ticker already on the Nasdaq and in compliance.

Thanks Reddit!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top Countries with Highest Long-term Interest Rates - 1960/2020  In this video the 15 Countries in the world with Highest Long-term Interest Rates - 1960/2020. 

&#x200B;

Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

I'm sure that you all are aware of this phenomenon, it seems that whenever ARK fund manager Cathie Wood invests in something, the individual ticker will always take off upon the release of daily trade notification reports.

One recent example would be PLTR - when PLTR was down about 2.27% on 14 Jan. After the trade notification report of ARKW's 497k shares purchase in PLTR was released after trading hours, reddit/stocktwit community immediately started to share about the news and it further amplified the news to a huge extent, where it popped 11% the next day after opening before inching back down.

Or another one would be the recent announcement to start a ARK Space ETF - and space related stocks were soaring on the very next day.

This phenomenon almost seems like the Midas Touch, where she has the ability to touch (or invest) anything into gold due to her almighty influence. Honestly, the best play I would reckon would be just to invest in her ETFs given the self-fulfilling nature and you never know when she will dump the stock (since a sell-off will inevitably follow thereafter).

I've been reading up a bit on these and it seems to be common wisdom that you don't want to hold these long-term, that the down days will eat away on your returns disproportionally, that they don't recover from crashes well, etc.

Comparing them in the last 10 years, large cap has won more YTD years. Large cap etf has also outperformed small cap etf overall in the last 10 years. So what gives?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (Opinion) Lower interest rates won't justify excessive valuations forever. I'm biased towards the we're overvalued side of things. 

It seems like lately the *only* reasoning many give for the current market prices are the low interest rates. This idea to me does not flow with the idea that most investors demand at least some type of safety or risk aversion with their investment choices. 

Lower interest rates, easy money, and simply no where else to put that money to gain a return, won't last forever. Sure, up until some given point (and that is the key) investors will flock to the only option available for returns. However, in my opinion, that level will slowly wane as the market rises along with the risk associated with it at these price levels. I don't believe investors will continue to put their money to work in a market that (at these price levels) only brings a higher level of risk with it. At some point money will stay on the sidelines. 

Low interest rates just might cut it as a qualifying reasoning for the current valuations, but they won't be the reasoning for a correction/recession if it occurs and stays. 

Low interest rates that fueled this IMO excessive market rally will eventually be named the cause of the eventual correction. At that point whether money on the sidelines flows in will be dependent upon the economic/stimulus conditions at the time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeking books recommendations for middle market M&A Hey everyone!

I did it in a pretty ad-hoc way, and just threw some of my paycheck each month into whatever looked good when I was thinking about it. That worked alright for me, but now I'm older and have a lower risk tolerance.

Lately I've been reading up on portfolio theory, and it seems like it would be a good idea to re-balance things so I'm more bond heavy. I currently have about $300k spread between stocks (90%) and bonds (10%). It seems like I should go up to somewhere around 20% to 40% bonds.
