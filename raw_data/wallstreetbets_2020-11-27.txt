First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice "To Break Even" turns into "Chance of Profit."  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS "CAPPED" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price.
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV.
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***Do I Have to Hold to Expiration?***

Lets say we buy the $MSFT 12/31 $230.0C.  Do we have to wait until December 31? No.  If the underlying increases to lets say $225.0 by next Friday, 12/4, we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit.  We payed $1.67 for the contract, but the price of the Call may increase to $3.67, so we could Sell to Close for a $200 profit, allowing us to move on to another trade.  But as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding.  The break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market.  Due to time and market craziness, I recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

I think this is becoming more relevant since the meme trade is so hot these days. I try to do TA sometimes and it's useless most of the time for me. Either I'm not good enough to do it, or it doesn't matter that much. It finally did something though by suggesting that I should bail on CRSR. The main problem with this is that the evidence doesn't seem to show up until the very end and sometimes you're already fucked by market open.

A blow off top is what happens at the end of a ridiculous rally where the price shoots up one last time before everything crashes and burns. Very often before a blowoff top you will have a final furious rally with volume that is very high, usually the highest volume day of the current rally, then a sell off that spirals out of control as people panic to grab profits and escape. This will be confirmed by the volume and fury of the sell off session.

\*See CRSR and JKS

I was actually looking at PLTRs chart last night and I didn't see the same definite signs of a complete meltdown. I wrote on my chart that a probable dip was coming, but no crash. Was gonna post it, but didn't feel like getting stormed by PLTR gang.

**TL;DR -- When the money flow indicates weakness and that money is flowing out of the stock, but the price is rising it's a pretty good signal to GTFO.**

&#x200B;

CRSR blow up

[CRSR had a beautiful setup to blow up. The green line below the main chart is the Chaikin Money Flow \(CMF\). It measures the money flowing in\/out of the stock. You can see that during the initial mooning phase, the money just keeps pouring in. Towards, the end the money starts flowing out, but the price is still going up. Basically smart money is getting the fuck out and giving their bags to the last group of FOMOers that will pay anything to buy.](https://preview.redd.it/yxj5rdl7gu161.jpg?width=1875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee60e6728b93be394e51f5d9c1139cf4eccd93da)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

JKS Meltdown

&#x200B;

[JKS was my first experience with this and of course I nearly lost everything. Almost the same exact story. Money flow keeps rising during the earliest parts of the rally, but then hits a high and begins to trail off. Smart money heads for the door as a final group of FOMO buyers jumps in, but you can see that the final spike in money flow is much lower than before. The JKS rally is actually one of my favorites because not only did it once hit 90 RSI and keep mooning, but the RSI stayed in the overbought zone for 3 weeks straight. One of the great legends of our time.](https://preview.redd.it/c07ndifrhu161.jpg?width=1611&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abf51f75fee9f9aae9baccfeeb3e5964427108c3)

Over the last month, the share price has nearly doubled. Roughly 2.25B market cap, with positive EPS. 

They just bought the brewery that makes Sweetwater, a treasure down in the Atlanta area. 

Info: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-04/canada-s-aphria-enters-u-s-in-300-million-craft-beer-deal

This is great for two reasons. First, it gives Aphria the ability to hop into cannabis-infused drinks without much effort. Sweetwater has DANKY beer, and that consumer base will slurp cannabis/CBD infused beer right the fuck up. Second, and most importantly, it gives Aphria an already build DISTRIBUTION NETWORK in the US. 

Cannabis is legal in half of the US, Mexico, Canada, and congress will soon take up a legalization measure next week. 

Info: https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-marijuana-legalization-bill-will-get-a-congressional-vote-next-week-leader-announces/

The CEO, Irwin Simon, previously led Hain Capital, which focused on food products, teas, personal care products, and the like. Granted there were some issues with the way they branded things “organic”, but that legal trouble seems to be mostly wrapped up.

Between legalization, positive EPS, an insane market cap potential, distribution network in the US and Canada, focus on both CBD and THC products, and solid leadership, I have no doubt this thing is going to MOON 🚀🚀🚀 through Q1 of next year.

John Maynard Keynes supplied the answer in 1936, in "The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money," by comparing the stock market to a beauty contest. He described a newspaper contest in which 100 photographs of faces were displayed. Readers were asked to choose the six prettiest. The winner would be the reader whose list of six came closest to the most popular of the combined lists of all readers.


"The best strategy, Keynes noted, isn't to pick the faces that are your personal favorites. It is to select those that you think others will think prettiest. Better yet, he said, move to the "third degree" and pick the faces you think that others think that still others think are prettiest. Similarly in speculative markets, he said, you win not by picking the soundest investment, but by picking the investment that others, who are playing the same game, will soon bid up higher."


Y'all made a shit load of memes, Citron reacted to the beauty contest, then you ignored the fact that the big brain move was actually about you reacting to Citron driving trades based on your memes.


I walked away making money because I have worked at a couple of other jobs outside of Wendy's, and can see more than 2 weeks into the future. I played 3rd-degree chess with your bullshit.


I know you guys can't read so TLDR: The more memes WSB produces, the more idiots jump in the game, the more money to be made on the other side.

Gather round the fireplace while you stuff yourself with pumpkin pie and your girlfriend get’s creampie’d by her other boyfriend.

I am here to talk to you today about $PSTH

You see, within the next 10 days, Warren Buffett is going to disclose a $1b position in this rocketship and it’s gonna rocket higher than a god damn snowflake on top of Mount Everest. 

🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How you can become a guaranteed BILLIONAIRE and TRES COMMA CLUB member with PLTR! Ok you retards, here's how we can all become billionaires with PLTR.

There's two options but both are almost mathematically guaranteed to make you mad gains to enter the TRE COMMA CLUB. This is science and math and shit nah I'm sayin?

Option 1: 
Buy PLTR 40C 1/21/22 for like 9$. That's like over a year away, which is a millennia. 

Option 2:
Buy PLTR 40C 11/19/21 for like 8$. That's like almost a year away, which is near a millennia anyways.


Considering PLTR has like tripled in stock in the last month, that means using basic regression and science, in 13 months when this call expires the price of PLTR is gonna be 1170$ which is 3x every month for 13 months. That's just math works you retards. You have a year to hit this 1170$ mark, which is fairly reasonable. Tesla went from 180 to 3k in over a year, so relatively tiny PLTR can go 30$ to 1200$ easily.

Results:
Both options are gonna be worth like 140k each, so it'll 17.5k multiply your money. For you retards who can't math like me that means if you put your life savings of 60k into either option, you'll have a Billion dollars and finally enter the TRES COMMA CLUB.

Your welcome._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Putting PLTR in Perspective with Multiples Hi all - not here to sway you autists, but just wanted to provide some multiples and comps to get your opinions on PLTR in terms of valuation. I don’t own a position but wish I did. Haven’t followed the stock or any news other than on here the past week. 

Some high growth software / analytics companies 

- SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~100x
- DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 40x
- MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 25x
- Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 15x
- JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 30x
—
- PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 50x

The above isn’t very helpful as it doesn’t reflect growth. But an EV/Rev/growth multiple does. Below are 2021E EV/Rev/Growth multiples, which give a better picture of how expensive a multiple is incorporating its growth 

- SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.2x 
- DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.0x
- MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.0x
- Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~0.75x
- JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~ 1.1x
—
- PLTR: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~ 1.5x

Estimates could not be reflecting recent news that would push its estimates growth rate higher, 
 lowering its multiple and making it cheaper on a relative basis. Maybe new estimates will normalize PLTR multiples above as estimates lag news but stock price is almost simultaneous._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What the fuck is FUBO I’ve literally never even heard of them until they IPO’d and I’ve sure as shit never even heard of anyone who uses it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BANGBUS is happening (HCAC/CNOO) Listen up retards, the [bangbus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020039415/timage_007.jpg) is finally happening.

NIO - citron short November 13 - stock up 20% since then

NNOX - September 15 citron tweets - up over 30% since then

PLUG - august 21 citron tweets negative - up over 100%

RST - this one was a long that citron estimated would get bought out for 50-60 - got bought out at 30

STMP - citron says SHOP is going to buy it - stock down 20% since

GSX - they’ve been tweeting for over a year so I couldn’t find their first short but it’s up from when they started tweeting

PTON - this is actually hilarious because they posted an article on March 13 that it was going to 5$ - it’s over 100 retard

SHOP - shorts it in October of 2017 saying they’re doing illegal shirt, shorts again in April of 2019 - it’s up a billion % since 2017 and 426% since the April tweet

TLRY - can’t find tweet but I was trading when he tweeted. It was around 80 and went to fuckin 300 before it crashed

JMIA - can’t find tweet but google it. They literally called Jumia a fraud at the end of 2019 and now they’re fucking long.

Are we seriously gonna listen to these fucking retards? They didn’t provide ANY evidence of why PLTR should pull back.

I got an email from them saying it's not their fault they mis-priced it, they quote Bloomberg prices which are accurate. But Bloomberg has the 76.742 price at 14:50, and trading212 is still showing the price at 81.430 throughout the trading interval 14:55 to 15:25, and 14:58 is when they executed my trade. They didn't execute at the price they quoted me, and it's not an issue of low volume because the price they quoted was 76.742 from when I placed the order, to when they executed it, and then a whole 30 mins later the price displayed was still the same.

Many of us had positions before today and some of us had no money left to support the drop. 

Citron helped dropping the price (by a lot) but they made huge mistakes in the past. We are bigger MMs than them, trust me on this one. 

Many investors sold their positions to collect profits (pussies) and hopefully buy again lower on Monday.

BUT.... 

The problem is that MANY of you retards got scarred like the fking sissies you are and closed your positions too. WE are to blame. We left me playing the game on their own, with their term. In other words, you bitched out.

As it turns out I didn’t realize my TD account wasn’t yet approved for Level 2 Options, and I had already transferred my money into TD, so it was too late to switch to RH :/

Ending up buying 262 shares @ $31.39 and then another 72 shares before closing @ $27.69

TLDR; I’m in 10k to PLTR and down $1k and some change as of closing 📉

QS is the meme stock buy into Revolutionary battery tech is the future. Quantumscape has solid state battery technology that, by their own words, has "blown past Tesla." If what they say is true, they're on pace to beat the current distance EV batteries are able to travel by 90% and charge up to 80% in an insanely fast 15 minutes. Bill Gates has invested $500 million of his own monies into this company and it is also backed by Tesla co-founder JB Staubel. They plan to install these batteries in VW's by 2025. This is quite possibly the battery company that makes mass EV transition a reality. They already have 18 patents on solid state technology that promises to resolve the obstacle of overcoming dendrites using LLZO, and while leaving out the details, Jagdeep Singh, the QuantumScape CEO, said that his team had worked out “hundreds” of bugs, and finally emerged with a working metallic lithium battery.

I am still beating that drum.      

GOLD’s date of record for their dividend is Monday, so Monday or Tuesday should be a prime time to buy calls or stock. My next buy in point is $22.10, though I filled prior positions at 22.89. I believe this is going to be $27-30 by January with the rise of tech(I like tech as well but IV and Greeks are a bit wonky for my taste).      

Sell the XOM stock when 10 year bonds get to .97 which should bring the price of XOM to about $62(im closing positions around the $58-60 range, but I’m in at $34 and don’t mind holding the position for dividends).

I was worried in the beginning too but less now. Next week I'm sure it will hit at least 38 and then Friday we will have to watch closely. Sell high then buy the dips because I'm pretty sure it will happen again but less extreme than today. I fucked up by being impatient but I'm not doing that again.

Idk shit about Citron and Andrew Left besides they like fingering themselves in the corner while their wives that wants to divorce them gets gangbanged. Don't be scared of them like I was earlier today.

Also it's not hitting 100 EOY so calm down but 50 is a possibility tho.

if you’re like me right now, you’re reeling over the big red that PLTR has seen today. 

Citron tried shorting PLTR today, and in the process it only went down 3 DOLLARS. that’s nothing. if anything, it gave you paper handed retards another chance to buy low to sell high.

also, companies going red during black friday / after thanksgiving is quite common if you look at past years. this is nothing new for companies. 

finally, PLTR hasn’t even released a vaccine yet. once they do, you can bet your ass you’ll be seeing the dark side of the moon soon. 

Citron has tried shorting Tesla, NIO, and countless others. look how they’re doing! it’ll come back up, stay strong with those diamond hands bothers.

buy high, sell higher.

Edit: I have faith in PLTR, please give my parents more reason to be disappointed in me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shitron calls PLTR a full casino Casinos have hookers and black jack! PLTR to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A calm explanation of PLTRs price action today 1. Citron Research declared a short with a price target of $20. Although they didn’t give any fundamental reasoning behind their short(other than saying it’s a casino, whatever that means), this inevitably lead to some traders selling their stocks to secure profits.
Citron has been proven wrong almost all of the times. Very recently with NIO. But also with TSLA, SHOP etc.

2. Traders securing profits. Some traders don't like to hold over the weekends and given that PLTR has runup so much in this week, it is very natural for them to secure profits.

3. Healthy correction. This is pretty obvious. As much as the sub likes to pump this stock. Without a healthy correction, a stock will not really moon. AAPL, AMZN, TSLA etc all saw their corrections in their days.

4. Shorter trading day and being the day after thanksgiving. This is an anecdotal reason, but generally there has been a pattern of correction in this day.

That's all there is really. Even if there was no reason, you should all have expected a pullback after such a huge runup.
Saying that it will go to moon without some bumps would be obviously acting like a shill.

Though I must say there is one note of caution in the options market. The numbers are not really in favour of options buyer any more in this stock.

I would recommend buying PLTR shares directly or selling puts FOR NOW._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The numbers dont lie _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Andrews mom called him left Because he is never right....

Please submit loss porn $2500 and up, I’m waiting patiently!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR red day Guys chill, it dropped a buck, even after a Citron short. Theres no reason for shares to go to 20$. He pulled the number out of his ass. Unlike NIO, he didnt write a paper or anything to justify why he has a short target of 20$. There's still plenty of room for PLTR to grow, play long shares or leaps. Weeklies are, and always have been, risky._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I looked more into the Citron claim to see if it was justifiable It’s not. They provide no evidence and just say “it’s a casino” that’s it. No technicals, no due diligence, just “it’s a casino” and every boomer just follows it. Like they literally posted the 🌈🐻 equivalent of a WSB user posting PLTR 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think I'll be another victim of WSB Bought PLTR @ 26.33 , Bought APXT @ 14.74, and Warrants at 3.30. 

Invested my entire 10k "fun money" TD account. I know its not much but, i'm an index investor and couldn't imagine putting any real money in single stocks. So, i'm hoping my first venture into WSB meme stocks doesn't take all of my fun money. I haven't done any DD, I'm relying on you geniuses. Wish me luck._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Team PLTR - a moment of your time We got this. Breathe in and breathe out. 

The stock went up 300%. Good. 

Despite all of our hopes - stocks do not go up every single day. Even poppa elon has days. 

People will try and shit on our tendies 

We need to sit tight.

We need to keep the faith 

We need to buy more calls

[https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1332340510623555585](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1332340510623555585)

He pulled a nearly identical move a few weeks ago with NIO. Conspicuously, he made both of these tweets on a Friday. My suspicion is that he does this to tank a stock on a day where he can benefit from 0DTE puts, whether he's buying them or others working for him are doing so.

Less time value = cheaper contracts.

For everyone thinking the PLTR party is over, don't lose hope yet. Just like with NIO, Left is likely publishing these hit pieces to create a short term opportunity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR post pump for Monday next week.

buy PLTR._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD for retards: buying GME at $15 is like buying TUP at $8 I know a lot of your don't care about fundamental analysis so I will show you DD based on ""price memory"" that is not fallacious at all.

What do GME and TUP both have in common? They were going to go bankrupt. **<- This should already convince you to buy GME because of what happened to HTZ in June.**

In June 2020, TUP went $8 and then had a massive -50% pullback (even worse than GME's scary pullback from $15 to $10). It was still 3x off March lows though (sound familiar?????!!!??) so no one was crazy to buy the discounted shares. Then earnings came and blew expectations. GME also expects amazing earnings even though Q3 only goes to October.

Also the short interest is over 100% of the outstanding shares. What does that even mean? It means it's going to be like ACB a few weeks ago **without the risk of holding fucking ACB** (because GME has more cash than debt, and they're paying off their 2021 bonds early already).

What did ACB do? **Short squeeze, duhh.** You didn't actually think a shitty company like ACB went up +300% because of fundamentals did you?

The next week, it rose 20%. On 11/13, Citron [announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nio-citron-research/nio-stock-falls-after-short-seller-citron-targets-ev-maker-idUSKBN27T2F9) it's $NIO short position and the [stock fell](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NIO/history/) from $51.29 at opening to $44.56 at close.

The next week, $NIO posted a 20% gain, rising from $41.12 to $49.25. Then the week after that, $NIO recovered from it's dip and reached its ATH (today).

Tl;dr - buy PLTR calls a month or more out, hold any options that don't expire in early December

$PLTR 3/19/2021 $40c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Please Post Screenshots Of Donations Here!! Hey guys, the world is starting to see us as selfish tards that control the market. People like Jim Cramer are painting us in a negative light. Please post your donations here so I can start a running total. We may be autists but we aren’t total shit heads. 

Jim Cramer I know you have your little intern shits in here, so I challenge you. 

If WSB has a running total over these numbers you have to: 

$100,000 (easy)- fuck off and leave us alone

$300,000 (medium)- shoutout PLTR, THC(B), and APXT. You don’t have to compliment and pump them, just call them a meme stock if you want. Just talk about them. 

$500,000 (hard)- Give us a shoutout on CNN saying we aren’t totally shitheads. Just stop attacking us and say something decent. 

$1,000,000+ (Autist level)- Put this post everywhere you can including CNN showing just how generous us tards are. Also donate $2,000 to your choice of charity and ask people on all platforms including CNN to do the same. If people as “stupid” and “terrible” as us can I’m sure you people with high morals should have no issue. 

I know this is a long shot guys but with all the people donating here and maybe this causing a positive feedback loop we can pull off another autist feet. 

Worse case- More people who need food get food, doesn’t sound too bad if you ask me. 

RUNNING TOTAL WILL BE UPDATED TYPICALLY END OF DAY AS I CAN. 

RUNNING TOTAL- $_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VGAC - Rockets, EVs, hyperloop and insider trading - The next great meme stock 🚀 VGAC is the ticker of Richard Bransons SPAC, he will use it to merge with a company to bring it public. SPCE was his last company that went public in a similar way and reached highs of $40+, VGAC currently trades at $10.30.

Branson owns another business which also does spaceflights, but in a much more economically sensible way. Its called [https://virginorbit.com](https://virginorbit.com) and its a low-cost satellite launch provider. They are cutting costs by launching the rocket from a plane which means they are much closer to space and need a lot less fuel which reduces the size of the rocket as well as the need for a spaceport. They can start from any regular airfield. Branson already said recently he wants to raise more money for Virgin Orbit: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-branson-targets-more-funds-for-satellite-launch-venture-11603231801](https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-branson-targets-more-funds-for-satellite-launch-venture-11603231801)

Another of Bransons businesses is the Virgin Hyperloop which is exactly as retarded as it sounds, but it would make the stock moon just as well: [https://virginhyperloop.com](https://virginhyperloop.com)

Branson also made some remarkable comments about Elon Musk and how he wouldn't be surprised to be competing with him soon in the EV sector. Virgin has a racing team in the formula e [https://envisionvirginracing.com](https://envisionvirginracing.com)

**Insider Trading**

VGAC already traded at over $13 AH 2 days ago +30% [https://i.imgur.com/XUS3qPQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/XUS3qPQ.png)

VGAC warrants were up over 80% simultaneously with over 50k volume.

Someone paid a HUGE premium to get into VGAC on Wednesday evening and paid many $100k more than he would have to if he just waited for today. **VGACs volume today was 3.8M or 1,000% the average volume.**

Basically anything below $13 is a steal for this shares and offers a lot less risk than most other investments that you see here.

**Position: 5k VGAC shares, adding another 5k next week if its not too late.**
