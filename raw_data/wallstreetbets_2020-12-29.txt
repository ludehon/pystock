 Bed Bath to infinity and Beyond - $BBBY - Solid DD Document Been seeing a few posts on $BBBY, wanted to share some solid DD (above mediocre) .

Load up and giddy up! Full DD document is in the link below, but here is summary as it's a TLDR.

Bed Bath and Beyond ($BBBY)is a great play on the continued trend in “home” themed christmas gifts. Despite Christmas, the home goods market is absolutely on Fire.

The best part about this trade is that there is a ton of data that supports the trade and it was EXTREMELY easy to uncover the supporting data. Huge shoutout to u/quantifiedmarkets for sharing some of these GTRENDS with me.

Bed Bath and Beyond is a parent company with the following Subsidiaries; Bed Bath & Beyond, Harmon and Harmon FAce Values, and buybuy BABY

These  companies are red hot this christmas season due to the continued trend stay at home/home furnishing related purchases.

The company has shed some of its subsidiaries this year and recently announced the sale of Cost Plus World Market. I believe this is the right move. The new CEO wants to trim the fat, and focus on Home, Health/Wellness, and Baby.

They recently rolled out same day delivery for buybuyBaby and Bed Bath and Beyond to compete with the Ecommerce Giants.

The trade here is that $BBBY has been getting beat up this last month. Down 7.7% in the last month which provides a nice point of entry for us DMers. I believe they are on pace to crush earnings based on the GTrend data provided below. (Web traffic data is forthcoming) Earnings are right after Christmas on **January 7th, 2021**. It will include sales from September, October, and November.

On December 14, [Bed Bath & Beyond approved $150 million](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-continues-fast-paced-transformation) for its accelerated share repurchase (ASR). That’s on top of the $225 million already in the ASR. That expands the company’s total share repurchase plan over the next three years from $675 million up to $825 million. Management plans to complete the purchases by February 27.

The InvestorPlace article below provides some great insight into a potential forthcoming short squeeze. It’s one of the most shorted stocks on the market… a Q3 beat + short squeeze would be a match made in heaven… for us long folks!

Apparently the famous VW [short squeeze event from 2008](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028) launched up the stock only 82%. There have been a lot of misinformation with people thinking it was some mythical 400%+ rise.

I'm a share holder but really tho, why do people expect GME to hit 50-100?..

Is it just false hope?

Edit: You can downvote or ignore all you want if you can't face the facts. I'm just gonna repost at a better time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CRSR: Y'all are missing the point (Elgato = Tendies) Alright fellow autists: this is going to be somewhat long (TL;DR at the bottom), but as someone who's dove head first into better understanding streaming, it's important to set aside the incredible name CRSR has in keyboards/mice/RAM/AIOs & highlight the reasons why **Elgato and its growing proprietary software ecosystem is the biggest reason why I'm deep into $CRSR.**

**Setting The Stage**

Even before the lockdown, streaming and watching video games was mainstream. There have been stadium shows, exponential growth overseas, and they even stream Overwatch and Fortnite on Disney every so often. Most people don't talk about watching or streaming games with the same level of dismissal as they used to.

Then the lockdown happened. Out of nowhere, everyone had more time to themselves and folks flocked to Twitch. Check out the chart below from TwitchTracker.

[Way more dudes watching women play \\"Just Dance\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ndyq77o3v6861.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=c76c86d60a09e178cc09e9bcde9a570f0821e7ad)

All of this is great, but as a CRSR bagholder this doesn't get me hard. This does:

[Gonna need more gear, bro](https://preview.redd.it/gniz20jgv6861.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=c037f131a224d2f326be8bc1f7cc85b0d1764318)

**"Why the fuck should I care about Twitch growth? I need them to sell more keyboards."**

Yeah okay but you're not getting it. There are a lot of streams on Twitch, and everyone thinks they're gonna make it. They're probably not, but the one thing people notice about pro streamers is their setup. They want it to look good, they want to show off their gear, and they want it to sound good. So how does CRSR fit?

* Just showing up
   * Nobody streaming console can do so without a capture card like the Elgato HD60 S. During the time of this writing, it's the #1 solution on Amazon with 11.3k+ ratings giving it 4.6\*
* Looking good
   * RGB to show off their build  (from case / fans / RAM & cooling solution) - this is where CRSR is best known
   * A good camera (can hook up to Elgato Cam Link $120+) -- or if you're a broke NKLA simp, you can use EpocCam to use your phone as a camera [(purchased by CRSR in October to become part of Elgato](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/29/2116972/0/en/Turn-Your-Phone-into-a-Webcam-CORSAIR-Acquires-EpocCam.html))
   * A good light to hide all your acne (Elgato Ring / Key Light $130-200)
* Show off their gear
   * Change stream transitions and switch gear quickly ([Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) $80-250)
      * BONUS: Guess what else has Stream Deck integration? CRSR's $100+ keyboards.
   * Green screen yourself so you float in the corner ([Elgato Green Screen](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/green-screen) $160)

**Riding the Wave**

A good-sounding stream is another story, and the moves of which are the biggest indicator to me of positive future growth. Up until recently, you had to get a normal mic with an XLR and plug it into an interface. The whole process was and is a PITA. You could always buy any USB mic, but your sound levels will probably be all fucked up. Without a mixer, you have to ensure the levels of game sound, your mic, a friend's chat mic, background music, stream sounds, etc are all perfect. This is a total mess, and I've watched my buddy haplessly run stream-after-stream with hilariously poor sound to no avail. Rich bois purchased [the GoXLR](https://www.amazon.com/GoXLR-Mixer-Sampler-Voice-Streamers/dp/B07JKNG4NV/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=goxlr&qid=1609276365&sr=8-2), a plastic interface that sells for $500. Yup. $500.

Elgato said "nah fuck that shit" and decided (as they clearly plan on doing in the future) this was fucking stupid and it could all be done via software. [This dude does a great job at explaining why this is important.](https://youtu.be/Kv5JO2Woxng?t=142) **When people purchase a Wave 1 or Wave 3 mic, they get access to Wave Link, allowing you to mix everything via software**. It looks like this:

[Elgato now has its claws sunk directly into your wallet](https://preview.redd.it/clztclzn07861.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc72a9680a71f61e94bb8d5d934ce37ecaf1ca20)

CRSR also figured all these new gamers would suck (tru) and purchased [Gamer Sensei](https://www.gamersensei.com/how-it-works) this year, an Esports coaching platform. This acquisition barely gave me a chub, but it proves CRSR is building a proprietary ecosystem and community used to both intro customers to the brand and get em hooked onto the product experience.

Elgato is doing everything right, and we've only seen a glimpse of what a company like CRSR can do with such a brand in hand. With streaming still growing, future tendies are hiding in Elgato.

**TL;DR**

* **Streaming has exploded and behavior has changed**
* **Even if enthusiast PC building doesn't explode, streamers will need tech to make them look pro; enter Elgato**
* **For mainstream consumers, Elgato is the only name brand streaming peripheral company in the space**
   * **More kids streaming = more kids begging their parents for Elgato/CRSR products = PROFIT**
* **Shares and Calls.

Here is a story for everyone. I used to be a young retard. Now I'm an old one. But there are some lessons to be learned from my young dumb and full of cum self. 

Lets take a trip to 2014. Graduated college and man I was going to make it big. Just moved to the city and I figured something out no one else did. swing trading. easy money. (so retarded I was buying and selling with a 7 dollar commission for each trade on merril edge). 

Well, I lost a lot of money. bar mitzvah money bye bye lmao. you know how long it took to get my hands on that moolah. 

But here is the lesson. Here is what I learned, and why I am going to HOLD PLTR FOR LONG TIME. These companies i bought. They kind of made it. in 2014, they seemed like a long shot. i lost money on almost all of them because they would go down 5-10% and i would be out. but if i held, man I would be looking good. 

Here are some of the positions from my 2014 realized gains/losses: 

Ariad Pharmacuticals - 2.1k shares. lost 840 dollars. Ariad was eventually bought by a japenese company i think and shot up like 70%. Fuck. 

Plug Power - 1,123 shares. all around 2.50. made 160. woohoo! We all know what happened with plug. 

Groupon - 110 shares at 8.54. At one point this this was like 130. lost 14 dollars. 

Irobot - 250 shares at around 48. lost $1,845. 

And these are just some examples, also had ballard power (loss), disney (small gain) etc. wow i suck.

If i just let these sit, well coulda woulda shoulda. But I will not make the same mistake again, I have 390 shares of PLTR and I AM HOLDING BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I HAVE LEARNED PATIENCE. 

blah blah blah boomer shit. PLTR set it and forget it. This thing will go up. I'm a fuckin retard don't listen to me_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TDOC update - Up $2,100 since yesterday.

I'm all in on ARKG shares, monthlies and leaps. YOLO

This covid will come back each year like the flu but more deadly. new variants. new mutations. there will be species hopping. you remember when it jumped to minks in denmark and then back to humans? They had to cull the whole population of minks.

you think they are that organized in south east asia? hell no.

There will be species hopping. new variants. they'll eventually need to vaccines.

I'm not saying we'll be constantly in lockdown. I'm saying this space will get red hot, even more than it is. And huge money making opportunities.

Viruses weren't invented this year, but everything is accelerating in this world. A new bug pops up in one place, it can spread accross the world in days and fuck everyone as we've seen this year. And there's also a huge number of existing diseases, genetic disorders, etc.

**THE FINAL BATTLE OF 2020 AGAINST THE MELVIN CUCKS IS UPON US.**

Listen up and listen close.

GME dropped from $21 to a low of $18.who-gives-a-fuck today.

This was orchestrated by Melvin Capital. Tomorrow, they're going to try to do the same. SSR will make this difficult tomorrow though.

**On 12/31, they're going to try to drop this stock AS LOW AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.**

*But, uh, sir swanpenguin, why uh is this so important sir? Why do it now?* 🥺👉👈

Lemme fill you in on a little secret.

Melvin Capital wants to raise as much money as possible to try to survive the absolute disaster that is their GME short play. 2020 annual performance is CRITICAL to how much money they can raise.

**12/31 IS THE FINAL DAY OF 2020**

These motherfuckers are DROWNING. They will do everything they can to drop the price as low as possible by EOD 12/31. They will pull every dirty trick they can to manipulate this stock down into the fucking ground so this mess looks manageable (spoiler: it isn't) .

What does this mean for you?

This means the best damn buying opportunity of your life to get in on HISTORY. You won't see a lower stock price and you can bet your ass you'll be watching us 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌝 if you miss the ride.

Will we see $16 or below on 12/31? Probably not. $17-18 is fair game though.

BBBY TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR outlook for 2021 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to spot a pump and dump 🐍 Some opportunist have taken to treating this sub like their own personal robinhood account. Make no mistake **they are here to profit at your expense.** I’m posting this because being pumped and subsequently dumped sucks, it just feels bad man. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

So if you don’t want to end up a jerry smith holding the bag on limited edition Star Wars coins then watch out for these tells that you’re being pumped.

1. **Urgency**: Ever notice that that best deals will disappear if you don’t act fast? This is a classic sales trick used to pressure you into making a decision without thinking. It works for cars, clothes, gym memberships, and... stocks. *No one can predict the price of a stock for EOW, EOM, or even EOY.* Anyone claiming to is absolutely full of shit. 

2. **Fomo**: We love to see gain porn, that’s why we’re here right? For that sweet fat FIRE! But there’s a difference between bragging and goading. If someone posts their gains of 2000% and encourages you to get in on a stock at ATH ask them where tf their dd was at 10% or even 50%, crazy how we never see that. You’ve already missed out, there’s no point in worrying about what if’s, even if you bought it earlier it would’ve tanked anyway. Just focus on the next play and move on.

3. **Zero Doubt**: Only a sith deals in absolutes. Believe it or not there is risk in every play and real dd considers it and offers counter points or the likelihood of either scenario playing out. The OP of a pump will leave this out entirely and claim a “sure thing” because this is the only thing stopping you from yoloing your kids college fund. In the back of your head you’re thinking “what if it tanks” and the OP will call you an idiot for even bringing up the risks. You are if you think a stranger is offering a free lunch with no strings attached.

4. **Emotional**: Nothing screams desperation like an overly enthusiastic and defensive sales pitch. A good investment will be rooted in facts and the OP will discuss its merit like a newborn in Sparta. If they insult, go all caps, or go to other subs begging them to come here and down vote you... then find another yolo because this person is way too hungry for your money.

5. **Rando**: This should go without saying, but if the OP has a Reddit age of 2 weeks you should be wary of what they have to say. Some folks do have a track record around here and while that doesn’t mean much, it’s at least some credibility compared to the obvious pump and dump accounts spamming this sub.

6. **Everyone is piling in**: An effective pump and dump will convince nearly everyone, largely because they utilize all of the aforementioned tactics. Usually the naysayers get down voted to oblivion. But the obvious plays have either already had their run up or there’s a risk that isn’t being considered and it’s why the price is what it is. This is that classic tulip case study you always hear about, the masses piling into a sure thing that inevitably crashes.

This isn’t exhaustive and you probably won’t see everything in a post, but if you see 2 or 3 you should be prepared to get stuck holding a bag for years or possible worse. 

And yeah I know this is a Wendy’s casino, but in a casino your odds are what they are, other players aren’t allowed to use your money on their bets so they can instantly cash out. And yet that’s what’s happening here. The house already has an edge, don’t give your tendies to some stranger on the internet.

I know this isn't school, so I'll try to make this easy to understand and impart some of my limited aCtUaL kNoWleDgE upon this community in return for all you've given me.

NKLA happened, and NKLA will happen again. There's a million ways to slice, dice, and wife profits off a meme stock like that, but my favorite way to create a long forecast on a fast-rising techie company is to **look at the company's IP holdings**.

Companies (especially startups growing out of diapers and getting ready to shit the bed) have great incentive to patent anything and everything they can. Patents prove the company is working on R&D, hired competent people, and has legal chops hovering feverishly. It gives them license to wave their dick around in the market space. Nikola's IP portfolio can be likened to Trevor Milton's bulge: ^(it's) ^(tiny.)

There are three easy "types" of patents.

1. Granted: "real". Legally sound. Valid for 20 years.
2. Pending: not "real", can turn real, valid for like a year.
3. Design: for design. Apple has many. Nikola needs none.

Nikola has like 9 patents (a minuscule amount for a company of its former stature) and almost all of them are design, or "D" patents. D patents are for Jonny Ive and the ghost of Steve Jobs' OCD. If a small company like Nikola or whatever goddamn meme stock you want to suck off this week has majority D patents, take a page out of Forrest's book and run. **You want a company with a history of turning pending patents into granted ones.** Even if it's a "new" company splooging all over the scene, I guarantee they've been producing IP for eons. If they haven't, that's a red flag big enough to cripple Lana Rhoades. If it breaks her, I fucking promise it'll break your margin account too. 

Patents should be

1. of the same volume as comparable companies in your meme stock's size and market space and
2. aligned with what the company says it's doing

Patents are forward-thinking documents. Companies want them to be viable and maybe even cutting edge 5, 10, 15 years down the line. You know what doesn't stay current for that amount of time? The design of a semi. Vehicles get redesigned year-to-year and substantially about every 5. You know what Trevor Fuckton decided to patent? A bunch of useless design patents protecting the contours on his DOA load of gravity-defying shit. And guess what? His company is garbage. Patents are a huge tell. **Good news for you addicts: NIO has a normal-looking patent portfolio.** Are they good quality? I'm not gonna look. But maybe you can.

**TL;DR since I know you want one:** My bidet's control panel is protected by more patents than Nikola has to its name. That's never a good sign. Do your dd.

Everyone I know buys their dildos on wish. Now I this isn’t just anecdotal. There’s mountains upon mountains of well-documented evidence which suggests that 75% of women have purchased and used a dildo during the pandemic. Why!?! 

Because women are fucking horny and men are all pathetic little shits that can’t satisfy a woman and their urges. 

51.1% of the world population happens to be women. 38.75 is 50% of 75. That means that wish dildos are going into 38.75% of all pussies in the world . Right now. At this moment. Even your mom.

Which might give the dildo market  an even higher valuation than Tesla. This is an untapped well of potential. 

Imagine 5 years from now? A man in every tesla a and a pink tentacle dildo made of temper glass in every woman. You can’t stop it.

Based on MPs 8-K, they currently only realize $3.74/kg for their Rare Earth Ore (REO). 
https://i.imgur.com/3yk0nlM.jpg

$3393/907kg is $3.74 per kg

This is the current price of Neodymium:
https://i.imgur.com/ymElv6u.jpg
It’s in CNY:

607500 CNY for 1 ton
1 usd is 6.53CNY
1 ton is 907kg

This comes out to $103 USD per kg at today’s prices.

This is a revenue multiplier that is going to be HUGE for MP once they have  processing capabilities in 2023.

I realize that there will be loss in processing, but they are also not yet at capacity. Plus the increased demand of neodymium magnets for EVs will further drive up price.

Look at the rise of neodymium price this year (chart above). The demand is so high, China is buying literally all of MPs REO because they can’t keep up with the demand. 

This is the estimates EV demand in the coming decade:

It’s scary thinking about how much the price of neodymium will rise based on this demand. 

MP is currently profitable, they have the funds to finish the processing plant, plus they have government backing.

Listen fellow retards, the analysts are sleeping on this stock. It's insanely undervalued. 

&#x200B;

From BBY last earnings call - “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,” stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. 

BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. 

But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR. 

Here's what 4hour on BBY looks like right now:

I came across an interesting article.  Currently, the main reason Tesla makes a profit isn't because they're killing it with car sales, or anything, its because they're selling EV credits to traditional car makers.  In other words, car makers don't make enough EV cars to appease regulators, so they sell them the EV credits and thats the only reason they made a profit and are growing like they are.  

When they sell EV credits, its 100% profit.  In 2020, they sold a billion dollars of straight up free money.  Currently, their profit for 2020 is quite a bit less than 1 billion.  Its also the only reason their profit, between that and stock offerings its basically their entire company.  Once traditional auto makers start producing their own EV's, if they can't offset these profits with car sales, Tesla will have a disastrous time.   Seeing most traditional car makers primed to have someone produced in 2021, I think 2021 could be that year.  

Tesla's valuation is insane.  Its mind blowing.  Im not a bear or anything, but this is something everyone needs to consider when holding tesla.  They're not making money on their car sales currently, and if they don't start soon, it will be take tesla back to boomer valuation levels._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You autists liked my last dumb and dumber meme, so he here’s another one to laugh through the pain of the last two days.

**Notable Transactions**

\- High volume on the 20$ C expiring jan 15th after earnings

\- Insiders have been buying shares @ 20$

Disney REQUIRES movie theaters and there is 0% chance they allow AMC to go under. Disney revenues could see a decline of nearly $300 million per tentpole if they plan on going PVOD (paid-video-on-demand) only with Disney+ subscribers versus movie theater release.

**Disney Tentpole Releases**

In 2019, Disney released eight major tentpoles with an average of $1.4 billion in revenue ($1.2 billion median revenue). If you take into consideration production and marketing costs, along with revenue share with distributors such as AMC and Cinemark, you’re looking at a net revenue of around $250-300 million. How does the math work? (rounded to nearest $100MM):

AVG tentpole revenue: $1.4 billion

AVG revenue share (@ 50%): -$700MM

AVG production cost: -$200MM

AVG marketing cost: -$200MM

AVG net revenue: $300MM

With an acquisition of the theater itself, you have embedded advertising within the theater for upcoming releases and more importantly, the revenue sharing would be wiped for AMC (which holds approximately 50% of attendees). The reduction of costs (cinema advertising, TV advertising, online advertising, etc.) would be dramatically reduced, likely around 20-25% given free media inventory, including email and elsewhere, could be used to supplement. The big savings comes from the revenue share reduction. Here is the breakdown of the savings if acquired:

Revenue share savings (@50% share): $350MM

Marketing cost savings: $50-75MM

Disney is expected to expand releases at a level of 10+ tentpoles per year across the entire seasonal cycle, with summer and holiday season being the predominant timeline. This level will likely not be reduced as Disney is in content creation mode which allows movie production to coincide with series production in order to consolidate production budgets (think Wandavision with Marvel and Mandalorian with Star Wars). These synergies will greatly reduce production costs going forward, but only if revenues will support. Disney+ content will likely not be net positive until some point in 2023-24. The net return moving positive will be realized due to pricing expansion as they are giving things away to further build their subscription moat.

[Here's Disney's full movie release schedule through 2027 - Insider](https://www.insider.com/disney-pixar-marvel-star-wars-fox-movies-through-2027-2019-5#pixars-soul-was-moved-from-the-summer-to-the-fall-of-2020-now-it-will-be-released-on-streaming-1) 

Why are theaters imperative? Mulan will likely show a revenue total across Disney+ in the $55-60 million range. Assuming we see the same revenue curve of traditional theater revenue, their first weekend of $35 million will likely net to be 60% of total revenue (revenue data for movies). With barely breaking $65 million in the box office, Disney likely left $600-800 million on the table had the pandemic not hit.

 [How important is the opening week to a movie's total box office? (stephenfollows.com)](https://stephenfollows.com/how-important-is-the-opening-week-to-a-movies-total-box-office/)

**Additional Revenue Sources**

Now here is where the other big element comes in that will have some speculative math. I wanted to add this in order to convey the possible revenue streams to come from this.  We can take a look at 2019 levels to work against. Here are the numbers:

2019 AMC attendee levels: 356MM (taken from the 2019 annual report)

Unique visitors: 71MM (assuming a five movies-per-year)

[Movie theater attendance statistics in U.S. | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264396/frequency-of-going-to-the-movies-in-the-us/)

One thing to note about people who visit theaters is their propensity for entertainment consumption and travel are higher than other individuals. What this means is that these people are more likely to be ones who go to Orlando or California to visit Disney parks versus other people. They are more likely to go to a restaurant and spend their discretionary money on experience. Cross-promotion of this audience with loyalty, Disney+ subscription, Disney annual passholder and other discount potential would allow further capitalization opportunities. Additionally, the creation of a brick-and-mortar Disney store within theater itself would allow for product purchase to an audience already showing demand for the IP they are going to see (think of Gamestop toys in an AMC “GME Gang 4 Life!”). Queue speculative math:

New Disney+ subscribers annual revenue: $100MM (@2% unique visitors joining annually)

Disney store (in theater) revenue: ??

Lease renegotiation/additional synergy savings: ??

Disney park/passholder revenue: $50-75MM (@2% of unique visitors with average visitor spend at parks) 

[Annual Disney Park Attendance Statistics and Charts | Disney Resources (disneynews.us)](https://disneynews.us/disney-parks-attendance/)

Advertising reduction: $25-50MM (based on a 10-20% reduction of current ad spending around $280MM for parks)

Total additional revenue and savings: $175-250MM

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**

This MFer is important. The corporate overlords have to find ways to spend their money the best way possible. They decide if content creation, capital expense with parks, etc will net the most in returns given opportunity cost. Within my own company and friends’ companies across the CPG/Media/Technology sectors, I am seeing anywhere between 8-15% IRRs. In other words, Disney needs to make that back with any capital expense, be it an acquisition or within their current assets. The return timeframe is anywhere from 2-3 years, especially in this environment since the concern of inflation in the next 3-5 years may push that IRR number up. Simple math, lets look at a 10% IRR in these calculations:

Current AMC market cap: \~$385MM

Current AMC debt obligations annually: \~2-2.5 billion

[Why AMC Entertainment's Debt Refinancing Is a Big Deal (fool.com)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/29/why-amc-entertainments-debt-refinancing-is-a-big-d.aspx)

Market Cap high (October 2018: $2.1 billion

While looking at a market cap high with a production company purchasing the assets is likely not truly a like-for-like view, understanding what potential savings that Disney would see if they purchased the AMC assets and capitalized on the savings noted above, we can assume this conservative savings level:

Tentpole savings (@ 10 per year): $4.5 billion

Additional revenue/savings: $175-250MM

Minus debt obligations: $2-2.5 billion

Net revenue gains: $2.675-2.75 billion

Finally, if we look at a 3-year window for the IRR assumption, we take the net revenue and minus the initial acquisition cost. We would not want to go down to the bottom of the IRR, but have the float be considerably higher versus the IRR minimum assumption of 10%:

2-year revenue gains: $5.35-5.5 billion + acquisition cost

Acquisition assumption: $2-2.5 billion, but likely even as high as $3 billion

Market cap range stock price: $12.50-15.50

**Headwinds and Entry Point**

Wow, stock price gains from $2.40 to $12.50 sounds wonderful, but I would preface to say that the next three months are going to be a rollercoaster. There are two major events that could be a catalyst lower:

1) share dilution due to an offering of 100MM shares (as about 55MM have been added of the 150MM that was noted in previous disclosures)

2) bankruptcy due to cash burn. If AMC does dilute further, we could see a 40% reduction from these levels. If bankruptcy happens, then it’s game over.

What does this mean? Entry point for me is some point in late winter, in and around the last week in February or early March. I would definitely wait until January is over to see what happens. It may be as late as April, but you may miss the bottom at that point. This isn’t financial advice, but no one ever picks the absolute bottom.

Do I buy shares or options? I would expect the stock price to creep below $2 over the coming months and think to enter between $1.50-2.00. There may be some crazy options available in the $3-5 range that look to be FD level, but may as well take on the stock side at those levels. If you do get into the options side, expect cheap leaps depending on bankruptcy news (as they are cheap right now anyways). Just understand it is a risky bet. After reading the archived u/Deepfuckingvalue post, I would think this may be one of those stories. The reason I don’t think this will be a Hertz-level bankruptcy is due to the dependency of the media companies.

As mentioned with a possible dilution, the market cap range for the stock gets reduced 40% ($7.50-9.25 give-or-take).

**Additional Notes**

While this is speculation, the two additional drivers for this event would be as follows:

1) Cinemark is eyeing AMC assets and Disney would not want Cinemark to have more control which could pressure revenue sharing

2) Regulatory concern over monopoly power would likely fall to the wayside due to the level of financial distress AMC is under and concerns over job loss and recovery concerns

The AMC assets are strong given the revenue they do currently generate. With a cost-cutter like Bob Chapek in charge of reversing AMCs course to sustained profitability being a win-win for AMC and Disney, this would fit in well with the Disney properties.

I welcome your brutal thoughts as I put on my helmet (the one with my name on it).

**TLDR:** If AMC isn't delisted by April, Disney will likely buy them.  Look for an entry point under $2 in late winter if they haven't filed for bankruptcy (not financial advice)!

Do your own DD. Doing this on my phone at work so forgive the typos. 

Here is a basic overview of steel and why I haven’t jumped in. I was scanning through a weekly report on miners at my work and was saddened by the loss of the tendies I have been seeing. 

Supply Side
-World steel production has been steadily increasing since 2015
-Covid has caused a shortage of steel, which has driven up prices 
-Supply has caught up with utilization according to Bloomberg (can’t attach chart due to rules regarding external use of information for my job)

Demand Side
-Top three uses of steel globally are construction 51%, mechanical equipment 15%, automotive 12%
-There is an excess of commercial real estate in the US. It is likely demand will continue to drop with the work from home movement
-National infrastructure projects will likely increase in the next few years 
-State and local construction will slow down do to missed revenue and budget constraints 
-New automotive sales will likely decline because used car prices are continuing to increase, this implies people are buying used and driving longer 

Potential tailwind is a weakening USD but this will cause all imports to rise. 

I’m not a steel bear, just trying to think through the trade and the time table. This is not 2008. History does repeat itself but rarely does it do so in the exact same way. 


Tldr: Steel demand will likely decrease while supply increases over the next few months._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Feeling bullish might f&@k your puts later Yes yes yes, I know: TA is like astrology in finance.

Boat EV._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forget the Jack Ma Grudge thing BABA is recovering fast because the anti-trust investigation/guidance is political theatre, not a legitimate threat.

The same narrative is in every post about this: "Jack Ma pissed-off the CCP".

That's not what happened. In fact, Ma's now maligned speech likely came after he had heard about the anti-trust legislation. So the speech didn't cause the regulations, the regulations caused the speech.

China would never destroy a company as large as BABA over an interpersonal grudge. And do it based on a speedy timeline because they need to give Jack Ma a "fuck you" sooner.

All of these actions - breaking-up the ANT ipo, investigating BABA - are part of a geopolitical strategy for China to expand their economic influence in the region and gain leverage against the US during the process of de-escalating the trade war once Biden takes office.

Mango strained the shit out of a lot of our alliances in the Pacific. Once it was clear that Biden would become president and the state dept would start doing shit again, the PRC had to lock-in its soft-power advantage in the pacific by finalizing what is now the largerst trade block in the world.

And they actually do need to reign-in BABA, etc. somewhat. Because no country in their right mind would have agreed to the RCEP with the PRC propping-up a giant competitor. BABA will probably need to drop the "choose 1 of 2" thing but that'll be it if anything.

So they did consciously crack-down on some anti-competitive practices but thats only to grease the wheels of the trade deal so they only need the *appearance* of due diligence.

Finally, Bidne taking office also means that China will need an alibi for putting pressure on the US to reign-in *its own* internet giants. They can claim they cracked some heads to pressure the US to do the same. 

I can probably cite some of this stuff but I'm lazy.

Alright my fellow autists. I know that plenty of you are tired of the pump and dumps and want to see some tendies after the new year. I’m gonna hit you with a boomer stock with a spicy mix:  
$KO Coca Cola

We all know Coke has been reliable with its returns for decades though why should you dump the remaining amount of your end-of-year Wendy’s bonus on a Buffett stock and how do we rack in reliable tendies? Here’s the deal: Coca Cola was fucking spit-roasted by COVID. We’re still in a 10% slump since March Madness and it’s slowly crawling its way back. Here’s the kicker: Coffee. KO has done a great job pivoting declining soft drink sales to bottled water (flavored and unflavored) and juices which keeps boomers sipping on Santa’s Coke-filled teets . 

What’s on the horizon is canned/bottled coffee and shit is going to boom.

https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/ready-to-drink-rtd-coffee-market-100285

It is the largest growing sector of non-alcoholic beverages with people seeking a cheaper alternative to the shitty local canned cold-brew and expensive Starbucks options. Cold brew took off as a healthier alternative to dairy/sugar bombed beverages and it saw a huge push (even Coors is making one). 

Coke is releasing its coffee-infused zero calorie soda in January and it’s already seen success with coffee reviewers and the company adjusted the recipes to better match what people wanted (more flavoring, less coke, more coffee). With the coffee market essentially going to the lowest bidder over the last five years, you can expect a company as large as Coke to have massive buying power with this coffee-infused soda as an introduction to something bigger. Also, with their experience in zero-calorie sweeteners, people will swarm an easy grab-and-go alternative to their Starbucks 600 calorie latte if tastes as good with zero calories as we try to get rid of these COVID waistbands. What’s better? KO thrives on bar culture; it makes enormous sales from cocktails and peoples’ tastebuds have moved dramatically to cocktails during COVID and they’re gonna be itching for something for more KO-filled drinks the second they can get back to clubs and bars.  
What’s better? Options are incredibly cheap. I’m all in with $KO 3/19/21 55c and expecting to be deep in the money come March due to natural rebalancing post-COVID, a resurgence in bar consumption, and add on any coffee for icing on the cake.

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.

This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017

[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)

I started by looking at the S&P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today’s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.

There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.

I agree with Peter Thiel’s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the “world of stuff”. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.

So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.

**Information Technology Cycles**

The following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.

Electronic Age

**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical labor.(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)

**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)

**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.(Important companies: AT&T, NBC, IBM)

Computing/Software Age

**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental labor.(Important companies: IBM)

**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)

**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)

Cloud/AI Age

**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.(Candidate Important companies\*\*:\*\* AWS, Microsoft, Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)

**Specialized AI (2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)

**General AI (2075-2100):** Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.

The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.

The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:

In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.

The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).

The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.

What it means today,

I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.

**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.

It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.

2020 Update:

If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees.

I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.

Position Update;Now have $220k in shares  (bought another \~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls. I fully expect to lose all my call value.  If it drops to 20, I'll add another 100k. These shares are long term holds and are the ones to pass down to your children._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Non meme plays since yall keep losing so much on meme plays The most boomer of plays is the utility stock and its a missed opportunity here. These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.

Why the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?

The call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more!

I think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls).

Longer term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. 

For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).

Most recently they've been in the news as the creators and masterminds of the "astonishing" new haptic technology used in the PS5 controller (which will likely set the new standard for gaming controllers moving forward) but they also basically dominate haptic innovation through licensing across industries as diverse as home appliances, mobile devices, medical electronics, and automobiles. **Immersion holds around 3,500 patents in this space.**

Rundown of current situation:

* Licensing agreement with Sony for PS5s ties IMMR earnings to unit sales not just of PS5 consoles, but also of individual controllers (often outpace consoles in units sold) ([source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/52f9973c17f94e56a03580d7dabbcdc9))
* Most recent earnings call (September 2020) estimated earnings to grow 214% in next 12 months (obviously on track - PS5 achieving highest launch month sales numbers in US console history)
* Company is cash positive with zero debt, maintained sufficient cash runway for 3+ years, reduced operating expenses by 58% while increasing net income to 2.9M in recent quarters
* Trading sideways all year waiting on PS5 launch (last ER in September did not fully reflect PS5 launch in November) & stock price has still not yet really jumped from initial PS5 sales. Reminder that Sony expects to sell 7.6M consoles alone (so, not inclusive of individual controllers sold) by March 2021
* Nota bene, about 50% of IMMR stock is currently owned by institutions alone - great sign for rising stock
* Controller has been getting great reviews\*, Sony now developing PS-VR interface with haptic gloves to be developed by/with IMMR patents

Okay, so fundamentals are all solid and point to undervaluation anyway, but here's the $TSLA upshot:

What's key to understand here is that IMMR is dominating this space because they are not being contracted to develop new technology -- they are licensing their DOMINATING patent portfolio ([source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/52f9973c17f94e56a03580d7dabbcdc9).) They have no serious competitors because (1) new competitors can't touch the patents they hold and (2) they are [highly litigious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_v._Sony) re: basically any work in the haptic space even if it DOESN'T have anything to do with their patents. Even Microsoft's legal team bent the knee. At this point, if you're developing new haptic tech, it will basically be with Immersion.

Well, Tesla announced back in early February that they planned to completely rework their steering wheels to center around a touch-based UI with extensive haptic feedback. The project then took a backseat coverage-wise to COVID, but updates are expected as early as Q1 2021 ([source](https://electrek.co/2020/02/06/tesla-new-steering-wheel-touchscreen-gear-stalk/).) IMMR is among the names thrown around as a potential contractor or licensee for the haptic elements of the steering wheel, but for the reasons above, it's also basically the only serious candidate. 

To be responsible and note some potential obstacles because this is real due diligence:

* Some PS5 owners have been complaining about controller hardware breaking down ([loose triggers, etc.](https://bgr.com/2020/12/25/ps5-dualsense-adaptive-trigger-breaking-loose-fix/)), but unclear if it's related to any IMMR tech specifically and seems unlikely to be
* CEO sold off $83k of stock at $8.29 about a month ago, but is only insider to sell shares in last 12 months
* Revenue dropped a little last quarter, but honestly, in line with winding up work to November launch of their biggest licensed product in last 4 years 

**TL;DR:** Strong fundies, HUGE earnings coming up, and potential moon linked to new $TSLA wheel, but most importantly -- premiums are so cheap that you literally can't afford not to pick up just a little exposure

The current clinical trial in phase 2B for AmnioFix has been praised as the “cure for cancer” of the knee osteoarthritis pandemic that is sweeping our nation. This process could eliminate the need for anti-inflammatories and postpone the need for knee replacements. The same product is in phase 3 for plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis.

So I was interested in what was causing the spike in the downward trend of the GME stock this morning and once being shared this link, I began analysing Melvin and other shorters approach.

What I noticed is that they firstly bought 60k worth of shorts limiting the available amount from 100k to 40k. This is not a lot and we all know it! Since then they are actually trying to ease off a bit and have begun reducing their short shares amount. Between 9.30am and 10.30am the number actually increased from 40k to 60k!

So what does this mean? Well quite simply this is market manipulation at it's finest and IMO they're very scared and we're close to the endgame. We just need to trust our process and DD and not fold with paper hands. They are literally trying to shake trees and see if anything falls out. The fact that they are easing their position between 9.30am and 10.30am means they know it cant't go on forever.

My guess is they want their EOY results to be good and are just trying to make it to next year! My recommendation is to BTFD and I would honestly buy more if I had any more available funds. Good luck everyone and keep your hands firmly on your shares.

AES, a battery storage utilities company. 10bln revenue, 8000 employees. I know [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) is retard, but check this dudes post to justify my title: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes\_corp\_renewable\_energy\_storage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes_corp_renewable_energy_storage/)

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

&#x200B;

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/yhg07kun35861.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=eafed8ebdb24dc96ddf2fc454f8d29e10182ea64)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too.

Get ready to BTFD on 12/31 If you look at iborrow the shares available to short at IBKR have been decreasing and the borrow rate has been increasing over the last few days, with price trickling up. The last time this happened was right before ER. Melvin is incentivized to drop GME price to make their year over year numbers look better so when people are mashing which funds to buy into Melvin looks better. Presumably the other funds that are short GME are looking to do the same.

EDIT: ya'll are fucking idiots. see u on 12/31_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ZUO 🚀rocket ship🚀fueling up (29% done.. 71% to go) Subscription commerce nerd checking in with an updated $ZUO DD, following their last earnings beat from 1 month ago.

My previous DD from Dec 4 **($ZUO up 29% since):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6k0gc/zuo\_to\_the\_moon\_pltr\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6k0gc/zuo_to_the_moon_pltr_potential/)

I'm still calling a 2x gain from Dec 4 levels by no later than the end of Q1 (we're already 29% up), here's why:

* $ZUO closed a deal with Siemens (one of the biggest manufacturers in the world with billions in annual revenue): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005181/en/Zuora-Helps-Siemens-Transition-to-Subscriptions-for-Cloud-Based-Medical-Products](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005181/en/Zuora-Helps-Siemens-Transition-to-Subscriptions-for-Cloud-Based-Medical-Products)
* Deal size undisclosed, although CEO mentioned during the previous earnings call that ZUO are working on their "biggest manufacturing deal ever". He didn't refer to Siemens directly, but it's likely to be the one recently disclosed. If not, even better - in that case they have another undisclosed new large enterprise customer waiting to be announced.
* Why is this important: Zuora charges their customers two different fees: There's a fixed annual fee that customers pay for their platfrom. This fee is relatively low. On top of that, **and this is the most crucial part, customers pay a % transaction fee** for each service or product which they sell through the Zuora platform. Siemens has billions of dollars in revenue lining up to be transacted through Zuora, as Siemens transition their business to recurring subscriptions.
* The vast majority of Zuora's customers are similar to Siemens: Large enterprises who are slowly (5-10 year process) transitioning from transactional sales to recurring subscriptions. During that ramp up phase, Zuora mostly just recognizes revenue from their fixed platform fees, as the customers are still not onboarding the majority of their revenues to the subscription-platform, while testing it out in "pilot mode". In the meantime there's a huge rocket ship being fueled up in the dark and waiting to be catapulted to Mars, once Zuora's customer go all-in and move over billions of dollars to subscription based business models.
* I think 2021 is going to be the year where we start seeing a hockey stick in revenue growth, as the global digital transformation of large enterprises is being further propelled by the pandemic. At the same time these same large enterprises (ZUO customers) who were reluctant to invest in digital transformation in 2020 are now becoming more comfortable with the global situation and are unfreezing budgets for digital / future-proof business models.
* $ZUO is very cheap compared to the rest of the NASDAQ and none of my research and upside is priced into the stock currently. This is a millionaire maker in the making.
* Next earnings Call (late Feb / early March 2021 time frame) is going to be a huge catalyst and I expect them to crush expectations again, based on the momentum build up towards the end of 2020 and expectations being fairly modest.

**TLDR;**

* ZUO to retest previous post-IPO highs from 2018 by the end of Q1 2021 (2x potential).
* 🚀🚀🚀ZUO TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀
* Some more rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

* 💎✋ and boomers: 2022 LEAPS / Shares (That's my strategy, holding a few hundred shares @ 16$ average)

I have over 10k in ARKK and ARKG and neither are showing up in my account after I received this message. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Billionaire and new New balance founder James Davis bought 12mil shares or a 9.8% Stake in XL fleet _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To the Guy who said to buy NWARF: Ya Fucked up About a month ago, I listened to a DD and bought 100 shares of NWARF.

And then they did a Reverse split. Went from being $500 (projected to go to $1000) to $9.

Guess it will just sit in my account, a constant reminder of WSB_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blue Prism DD. 100%+ upside potential in the near term based on the upcoming UI Path IPO Blue Prism is a RPA (robotic process automation) company based in the UK. If that sounds cool, its because it is. Essentially its SAAS tools to automate processes for corporations, and the business model is based off of recurring revenue. The TAM for this kind of software will only increase in coming years. I expect to see this company in Cathie's ARKQ portfolio someday. Blue Prism is a 2B company, founded in 2001, trading on the London Stock Exchange.

&#x200B;

**Why the play?**

Blue Prism's main competitor UI Path is on track to have a 1H 2020 IPO, with an expected valuation of more than 20B. UI path has around 500M in recurring revenue, putting the company's valuation at least at 40x sales. Blue Prism on the other hand is only trading at 10x sales. I expect that as the IPO nears, Blue Prism's valuation will start to converge with UI Path as the businesses are very similar.

Source: [UI Path going to IPO 1H 2020 with valuation of more than 20B with recurring revenues of 500M](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/uipath-is-said-to-be-close-to-filing-confidentially-for-ipo?fbclid=IwAR0hvpY5YsW0q2z7Ucz0QgeZ8HMWoFKRo2BPVK5VBC5irP5LpsU1bQCtQtM)

&#x200B;

While Blue Prism is not inherently cheap trading at 10x sales, the company has been growing at a blistering pace, with the most recent 1H financials showing revenues growing by an astounding 70% despite some customer losses due to COVID. Blue Prism is likely undervalued at the moment simply because it only trades on the London Stock Exchange. Another potential upside is that the company will likely be uplisted to the Nasdaq sometime in the near future.

Source: [Blue Prism latest financial report showing 70% revenue growth despite COVID disruptions](https://investors.blueprism.com/sites/blueprism-ir/files/blue-prism-group-plc-30042020-rns-final.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1S61l8GNr7oJLGsjgKC4nrDZSHluGh1s65kjDm3kzoF1zPQefL49b8pqM)

&#x200B;

UI Path likely has similar growth rates, though is a bit larger player than Blue Prism. Saying that, the customer reviews and offerings for the two products are very similar.

Source: [Gartner comparisons of the different RPA (robotic process automation) software](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/robotic-process-automation-software?fbclid=IwAR0kNxPWABKz4GNDhCf-zNhwixpcvyq9OoKvlvmHNnZisvy0NPdrXyfU7ug)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

The main risk is that the IPO market is not as strong in the 1H and UI path does not command a high valuation as expected. This is also a small cap company so the share price can be volatile.

&#x200B;

**TL/DR:** Blue Prism is trading at 10x sales while its main competitor UI Path is expected to IPO within the next 6 months at 40x sales at least. The services offered by both are similar, as are the growth rates and customer reviews.  I expect that Blue Prism could double, and perhaps triple as it converges to command a similar valuation to UI path.

Positions: 500 shares of PRSM.L._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | Fubo, GM, Tesla, Ford, Lemonade, Nikola, JP Morgan &other news [12-29] **Why did FuboTv and Lemonade crash yesterday. JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.

We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.

We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.

While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.

Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.

[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn’t yet announced anything.

In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can’t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don’t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.

We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman’s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US Gross domestic product by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a Gross domestic product growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Have you fellas looked at the sky tonight? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSTH FEB19 22.5P Can somebody please challenge me why this is not a great trade?

You can sell the PSTH Feb19 22.5 put option now around $0.55. This means that in the worst case the price goes below 22.5 and gets exercised, you have to buy 100 shares for a below $22 cost basis. The cash itself in PSTH worth $20 per share I believe.

Not only this, but if you hold those shares through the merger, you also get 2 $23 warrants after every 9 shares you own. So if your option gets exercised, you would also get 22 warrants.

Billy wants to merge with a stable company, free cash flow etc., so I do not see much chance that it'll ever trade below $20, on the contrary. In the very worst case it'll never ever trade about $23 and those (free) warrants will be worthless.

&#x200B;

There is a link circulating which folks are taking to mean that Palantir has been acquired by Thiel's venture capital firm, Mithril LP.

Link here: [https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675)

This is a bit misleading. This FTC notice is not showing the completion of a merger, but actually is showing approval for an early termination of the Harte-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Waiting Period of a pre-merger process.

The HSR period is a 30 day period where parties to a merger or significant asset transfer make submissions to the FTC and DoJ. This is a component of several standard procedures required by the HSR act, which is basically just a series of antitrust regulations that I'm too retarded to understand.

Link:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino\_Antitrust\_Improvements\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act)

So, it could be that a majority stake PLTR has been acquired by Mithril, but we do know how much exactly or when this acquisition will take place. All the FTC has said is that in this case the 30 day waiting period to file notifications isn't necessary. Perhaps Thiel and PLTR did all of the document filing really fast or some shit I don't know. Thiel mentioned in the earnings call that Mithril MIGHT take a controlling stake.

HOWEVER, According to the FTC, the HSR Act must also be followed (including the 30 day HSR period) in the event of a **large transfer of assets of just about any kind**, so this notice may not be the confirmation of a majority stake acquisition, but rather the confirmation of Mithril just buying shares in excess of 62.8mm USD (if you exceed this amount you MUST report under the HSR act). Similar HSR early terminations have been approved for other sharebuyers since the DPO. This analysis makes much more sense I think.

What does this mean for shareholders? If it's the case that Mithril buys up a large tranche of the float that would certainly be bullish and would definitely squeeze the shorts, but Mithril has only maybe 1B USD AUM ([https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp](https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp)). Is this enough to buy a controlling stake? Somebody who is less retarded than me can do the math.

**TL;DR, Palantir probably not being acquired, but Mithril is buying shares in Palantir to the tune of 62 million or greater. ROCKETS.**

Long time lurker, first-time poster. Was introduced to WSB by a friend and bought GME a few weeks back. Best decision of my life. I've just gotten out of GME and am putting all of that cash into ViacomCBS (VIAC). Here's why I'm extremely bullish about VIAC:

**Introduction**

The global video streaming industry continues to grow at a staggering pace and **revenues are expected to double over the next 5 years to \~1 Tn**. Few pure-play media assets remain, with surviving firms beginning to explore alternative strategies in the face of disruption. There are **three main trends** currently in the industry:

1. Merge / acquire downstream (typically with telecoms) (e.g. AT&T / Comcast) and launch DTC offerings
2. Launch DTC offerings (e.g. Disney, ViacomCBS) without downstream merger
3. Stay the course, seek opportunities for sale (e.g. Lionsgate / Discovery)

The **primary issue with type (1) companies**, in my opinion, is that the **high cost of an LBO / M&A have increased debt levels of companies such as AT&T**. Shareholder inertia coupled with high debt-servicing costs in the long term will translate into **lower content spend** and **higher bankruptcy risks moving forward**.

Yes, interest rates are at an all-time low currently, with the fed pledging to keep them at 0% for the foreseeable future. However, I believe that it would be a mistake if we were to disregard financial frictions increasing debt servicing costs. Banks have already started to tighten loan originations, and consumers are beginning to cut back on retail expenditure. **Falling consumer confidence and consumption, increased asset price dislocations, and likely regulatory failure may precipitate a credit crunch, one not dissimilar to 2008's subprime crisis.**

If I had to bet on which firm would survive the following few years (AT&T / Comcast / ViacomCBS), I'd put my bet on ViacomCBS. **It is important to not simply examine gearing ratios to determine a firm's liquidity moving forward, but also their inherent cost structures.** All three firms are highly levered. However, unlike AT&T and Comcast, **ViacomCBS is also actively reducing their debt**. Rather than acquiring traditional satellite tv providers (looking at you AT&T), it decided to sell off legacy businesses (e.g. Simon & Schuster). In addition, it is worth noting that the majority of ViacomCBS' debt comes from the acquisition of media IP.

In summary, **ViacomCBS is navigating industry headwinds with relative ease compared to telecom-media companies**. It has an asset-light structure compared to AT&T and Comcast, and is hence **better positioned to move into the digital streaming age**.

**Comps**

**At the moment, VIAC trades more like a traditional media play** (low PE ratio of 8.55). Comparables include Lionsgate (PE: 12.7) and Fox (PE: 10.7). Even when benchmarked against traditional media play comparables, VIAC is undervalued. There is substantial market demand right now for traditional media assets as the streaming wars continue to heat up. **At the very least we would be looking at a 20-30% jump in VIAC if we simply rely on comps analysis.**

More importantly, ViacomCBS has been digitalizing and reorganizing themselves to become a streaming giant - more comparable to Netflix (PE: 82.9) and Disney (PE: 86.4). Even Comcast has a PE ratio of 17.7. **Paramount Plus has already launched in certain parts of Europe to great success**and will be **launching in the US and Australasia in 2021 (More on this later)**. Valuing VIAC as a **Content as a Service** play would mean a **potential 10X upside**.

**Execution**

Extremely robust growth in streaming of **72% YOY**, with **total US subscribers** to Pluto and CBS AA **totaling** **\~46M**. This is greater than 50% of ***Disney+'s global subscription base***, and a strong showing given that ViacomCBS has only started focusing on streaming a little over 2 years ago.

ViacomCBS has named **Tom Ryan as their new head of streaming**. Ryan comes from ViacomCBS' acquisition of Pluto, is a **notable figure in the startup and venture capital community,** and has sat at the **convergence of retail and entertainment** over the past few decades. He was formerly affiliated with Trunk Club (retail disruptor acquired by Nordstrom) and Bessemer (one of the valley's leading VCs). It is **increasingly difficult for large corporates to acquire innovative talent**.

Unlike AT&T, **ViacomCBS understands branding**. Their decision to streamline their streaming services and rebrand them as Paramount+ (which is a relatively visible brand globally) is nothing short of a stroke of marketing genius. Compared to its competitors, it is **building on a brand that has been associated with quality films and TV programming globally**.

What are its competitors doing? **I sure as hell have never heard of Peacock before 2020**. And while HBO is associated with quality programming globally, **AT&T has had substantial brand confusion across its streaming products**. I mean, there is HBO Go, HBO Now, and HBO Max (in addition to a variety of AT&T streaming brands). AT&T's branding strategy is a complete clusterfuck.

**Content**

Content is king. More specifically, proprietary content is king. At **30,000+ hours of content**, ViacomCBS will have **one of the largest content libraries** when Paramount+ launches.

In addition, it owns a **large library of top-tier proprietary content** including Star Trek, Gossip Girl, Survivor, and Billions. As licensing agreements with distributors and other streaming platforms expire, ViacomCBS will be home to one of the largest proprietary content libraries in the world. At the end of the day, differentiation is king; and **differentiated content attracts and retains customers**.

More importantly, **proprietary content allows streaming providers to scale their offerings globally**, eliminate distribution fees, and reach consumers directly. Paramount+'s access to a large library of proprietary content (which can be scaled globally without licensing concerns once existing licensing agreements expire) means that Paramount+ has a shot at becoming one of the leading streaming services globally. It is also worth noting that **the number of media assets available for purchase has dwindled over the years** (Lionsgate is one of them). Most have been snapped up by Disney. Whatever scraps are available out there **will not make a big difference to the quality and quantity of proprietary content that existing streaming providers can offer**.

**Concluding Remarks**

**This is not a winner takes all market.** These streaming providers are the cable providers of the 21st century - except they are able to scale and reach an audience that is 20X larger than the cable providers of the 20th century.

In short, **ViacomCBS checks all the boxes - execution, branding, talent, content, and value.** **It is on track to become one of the top 3 players in the streaming wars and is an extremely good buy today**._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I really hope he remembers 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMZN Trading at a Discount - Target 3400-3450 Amazon has been trading at a discount to the S&P and its ETF 'XLY' of which it makes up 27% ([https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/the-consumer-discretionary-select-sector-spdr-fund-xly](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/the-consumer-discretionary-select-sector-spdr-fund-xly) ) 

If the broader market remains bullish to neutral, you want to see it hold the price above 3250 it will make a move to 3400-3450 area which is where the institutions will take profits.

Candles are trading below the S&P (Orange Line) and the ETF (Blue line) therefore its at a discount to the boarder market and its peers. There has been a rejection of the 50% pullback (red arrow) and and fast move up through the resistance area of 3250. The short term target is now the green box for the institutions.

(I Promise, I am not a 🏳️‍🌈🧸) Before you just dismiss me as a **🏳️‍🌈🧸**, please listen to what I have to say. If you disagree, please engage in the comments with facts to back up your claims.

**1 Part Economy**

The cost to produce a 3d printed metal part is its printer cost spread over the parts produced by a single machine, material cost, and labor cost. 3D printing is largely automated, so labor is minimal. Material cost will not change between 3D printing and metal injection molding because they are made from similar metals. So, the one cost that ends up ruining the part economy for many printers is the printer cost itself. So, the faster a printer goes, the cheaper the parts are.

**2 Speed**

So, since fast printers make cheap parts, this is how profitable part economies are achieved, and this is the number 1 metric when comparing printers.

$DM's Shop system prints at 800 cc / hr along with their P-1. This seems very fast when you compare to laser systems printing at about 150 cc / hr., this is nothing compared to the low end X1 25Pro printing at 3,600 cc / hr., and especially the high end X1 160Pro at 10,000 cc / hr.

Now, those of you who have done your research will say: "Hey, the Production system prints at 12,000 cc / hr." And, you are right, this is what $DM claims. But, they haven't brought it to market yet. They have been promising this printer since 2017, but continue to push the project out. Currently, it is slated to begin shipping 2nd half of 2021. At the best case, $DM's Production system will be on par compared to the 160Pro. However, in the worst case scenarios, the Production system is pushed out another year... or it does not actually print as fast as it claims.

**3 Market Cap**

Okay, this one is easy. We just compared the printers. Now, let's look at the market caps... $DM is at $4B+ while its competitor is at $200M. We stated that at the best case scenario for $DM, it's printers will be on par with its competitor once production begins. If this were the case, their competitor is an easy buy because they are undervalued by 20 x.

**4 Experience**

$DM began when Ric Fulop left as a board member at Markforged and decided to start his own metal 3D printing company instead in 2015. However, their competitor has been making metal 3D printers since 1998 and the 160Pro is their 10th generation. The built up IP and experience cannot easily be overcome.

**5 Conclusion**

If you haven't guessed it yet, yes, $DM's competitor is ExOne. It is priced competitively and offers potential for 20 x gains. This will skip da 🌕 and 🚀 straight to Mars!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RIOT Passed $1B, WSB Fair Game _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XPEV DD 🚀 Ting will bounce   🚀

TLDR buy dip, ling make stock go back up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $1,058,000 in $PLTR YOLO 7 figures in $PLTR

I sold $150,000 of CCs expiring next year around mid-day today.

Used that (along with deposits and margin) to increase my PLTR position by $300,000 (11,600 shares) EOD and buy $37k more weeklies.

Have $250,000 more ready to deposit if it dips again. (Aka $500,000 more including margin)

Total position:
$1,080,000 in shares (42,000 shares)
-$22,000 in calls (negative since I sold more CCs than the calls I bought are worth)

= $1,058,000

I think everyone here has read the mad scientist's DD on NVAX and how it's the superior covid-19 vaccine. His DD is the closest thing to  insider trading.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd\_from\_an\_actual\_scientist\_nvax\_might\_not\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/)

However, his calculations as to when Novavax would hit 50/66 cases in their UK phase 3 trial and release their preliminary results was a bit off. He predicted that the trial would hit 50 cases sometime in between December 12th and December 20th. To his credit he said he isn't a statistician and his area of expertise is more on the actual substance of the vaccine and how insane this NVAX vaccine is going to be. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaulkc/final\_update\_and\_predictions\_for\_nvax\_time\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaulkc/final_update_and_predictions_for_nvax_time_is/)

&#x200B;

**New Info: When Preliminary Results Will Drop**

So when will Novavax hit 66 cases in the UK Phase 3 Trial and release preliminary results which will send this stock to the moon? Recently, the Novavax trial hit the threshold to unblind their participants. Unblinding means that they tell participants whether they had the real vaccine or the placebo. Basically, they hit enough cases which means they are either nearing or have completed collecting all their data and are currently processing it (you don't unblind before most/all your data is collected as telling participants whether they have placebo or real vaccine may affect results). So this is the first sign that they are SO FUCKING CLOSE to wrapping up their Phase 3 UK Trial.

[https://twitter.com/jack\_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20](https://twitter.com/jack_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20)

**( IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME READING, LITERALLY JUST READ THIS PART. IMPORTANT PART BELOW: )**

Not to mention this guy and a lot of other people on Twitter who were unblinded by Novavax were literally told that they should expect preliminary data in 2-3 weeks. Given that most of these posts were made around December 23-24th right before Christmas, 2-3 weeks from then is either the week of Jan 3-9 or Jan 10-16. You have literally been told when to drop your life savings on FDs and when you should expect this stock to moon down to  a 2-week window.

&#x200B;

**What To Do**

So if you've been discouraged and been holding NVAX calls that have been getting raped by theta decay, keep bag holding or at least sell synthetic covered calls 1 week out to offset some of that theta decay. If you're holding calls that expire before 1/15, you might want to close your position and roll back your calls to either 1/15 or 1/22.

This stock is going to the moon as soon as the UK Phase 3 Data releases. We saw this stock jump 20% in a day on indirect positive news of competitors such as SinoVac having a failed vaccine. With positive preliminary data, NVAX will jump even more and I can see this having 40%+ upside off of just the preliminary data.

I am long GME, PLTR, and PSTH.  I have also been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but am able to manage it effectively with marijuana and delta-8.  I am able to take my paychecks from my jobs at CVS and Amazon Fulfillment center and fund my weed and delta 8 medication (I live in a state where it is not medicinal or recreationally legal) by trading on RobinHood. However I made some bad trades recently and lost most of my money. 

That said I am YOLO’ing my entire account on PSTH. And here’s why, I rely on my cousin to loan me money to keep my weed/delta 8 inventory supplied, and he is getting a MBA at a top school right now and is recruiting investment banking for Sponsors groups.  He told me that he was having a call with a person at one of those big banks that’s not Goldman Sachs, and that that group told him they had met with Bumble and Bill Ackman recently.  It just now occurred to me that that was a PSTH de-SPAC meeting and Ackman is assessing them as a target.  Stripe is off Bumble is on.  This would go right in line with Bill Ackman’s woke empowerment angle.  

I don’t know if that makes sense as a long-term play, but it would definitely pop in the short term if it were announced.  Blackstone could be looking to monetize on its investment last year.  

It is a SPAC, and probably the best most likely yo pop SPAC on the market.

This would interest those based in the US and trading non tax exempt accounts. 

This specifically applies to many of you who turned 10k to 10mm. If you have 10mm in short term realized gains from stocks, make sure you take out enough to cover the taxes and start easy next year. If you made 10 this year, lost 5 next year and quit, guess what you don’t have 5 million, you have close to zero (depending on state).

I’m sure a few of you took the profits, but are diamond handing losers. You’ll have to pay taxes on realized gains, but if you give up on losers next year (rather than before year end), you can deduct only 3,000, carrying the rest over.

For starters here are the latest estimates + previous quarters & comps to give you an idea what kind of size and growth you are getting with BJ’s:

Revenue:
Q4 ‘20 Estimate: $3.9bn
Q3 ‘20: $3.7bn
Q4 ‘19: $3.5bn

Gross Profit:
Q4 ‘20 Estimate: $674mm
Q3 ‘20: $743mm
Q4 ‘19: $622mm

EBITDA:
Q4 ‘20 Estimate: $189-206mm
Q3 ‘20: $233mm
Q4 ‘19: $221mm

EV/EBITDA:
Q4 ‘20 Estimate: 7.8-8.2x
Q3 ‘20: 9.6x
Q4 ‘19: 12.8x


Now onto where I think analysts are completely off - Membership fees & retention aka recurring revenue, something that gets Wall Street hard as a rock. 

Most are expecting membership growth to decline quite a bit in 2021. For context, BJ’s has added 700k members this year to 6.2mm, one of their largest increases in recent memory due to Covid & people staying home. 

These “Analysts” are expecting 50% renewals for first year members vs. historically being in the 58-60% range. This is factored in with the typical 87% overall renewal rate which comes out to ~5.8mm members to end FY2021. This is where the f*** up is. 

Memberships are not going to decline 400k next year. It’s just not happening, I can almost guarantee it. There are many tailwinds in 2021 that indicate continued membership growth:

1. BJ’s is planning to open 6 new clubs over the next 12 months which translates to roughly 150k new members at a conservative rate of 25k per store.
2. Covid. At this rate we are looking at June/July here in the northeast for a complete re-opening. Means more eating at home and more BJ’s.
3. We are creatures of habit. The 700k new members who are doing their grocery shopping and cooking at home aren’t going to just stop suddenly. If BJ’s can execute with good customer service people will continue coming back. This one may be a bit out there but bare with me.

TLDR: Analysts estimating $740mm EBITDA in 2021 is complete joke - buy BJ’s.

https://s22.q4cdn.com/311271118/files/doc_presentations/2020/12-2020_Investor-Presentation.pdf_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Every single one of us looking at after hours on RH after getting ass rammed on our meme calls today. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba, Dengism, and the Chinese push for foreign investment Strap in for a wall of text boys, it's worth it I promise. 

China's Crown Jewel, Alibaba, is trading lower in US markets on uncertainty surrounding a series of problems the company has been facing in the US media and public eye. The following are the 'catalysts' to this price action, by order of popularity in the US News media:

1. The delay of Ant Group's IPO , owner of Alipay and affiliate company of Alibaba, headed by Jack Ma
2. Antitrust investigation into Alibaba for antitrust practices, namely 'forced exclusivity' agreements with vendors
3. Rumors of bad blood betweeen Xi Jinping and Jack Ma
4. Fears of heightening hostility between US and China through trade and posturing, risk of a 'Cold War II'

All of these are immaterial, however, in the face of a much larger 'catalyst' that has been historically holding down prices for Chinese firms: red-scare propagandizing of planned economies within the US public, lack of information available to foreign investors, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the political environment and philosophies of Chinese government.

The fundamental reason for my thesis is my belief that these secondary catalysts will be removed as China opens further to foreign investment, in line with the philosophical framework that underlies their society, namely Socialism with Chinese characterstics and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Under these philosophies, China, a socialist state whose stated goal is the development of communism--a form of stateless, classless society--must harness markets where necessary within society's productive forces to maintain their position as a global power while the state apparatus continues the 'transitional phase' between socialism and communism, which is basically a very slow retraction or 'phasing-out' of the state once stability has been attained under public ownership. The people must resist capitalist aggression against China in order to be successful, since in their view China has a target on its back in the capitalist world community, and must be destroyed to maintain the validity of existing contradictory power structures within capitalist nations. In order to accomplish this, China has opened itself to foreign investment from capitalist nations, and seems eager to stabilize their role in the international community and 'spread the good word'. Whether you agree with the dominant political ideology in China, it's highly likely that it will be a key predictor of their actions in the coming months, and it is the misunderstanding oft his ideology by foreign investors that is driving their overreaction to recent news about Alibaba, and a much larger problem of high volatility and negative sentiment surrounding Chinese firms.

Under the philosophy of Dengism, if we re-examine the four catalysts driving down prices in international markets, they prove to be immaterial. Ant Group's IPO delay after Ma's struggle against regulators is part of a larger push to attract controlled foreign investment in the Chinese finance industry. Alibaba itself is not Jack Ma's property, but now part of a larger structure that must be maintained, at the risk of the collapse of the entire socialist project. If Jack Ma displays insubordination or lack of adherence to this goal, then he must be made to understand the error in his ways, or risk condemnation by the state which he is working against. Antitrust investigations into Alibaba are a push to encourage competition in the market, again with the purpose of attracting foreign investment in the country as a whole. Alibaba and Ant Group both welcome regulation, as it is part of a larger social project towards and evolution of society, and to go against this imperative would go against the very ideology their nation was founded on. Any 'bad blood' between Jack Ma and Xi Jinping is no greater than between Xi and any other chinese billionaire, and entirely depends of Ma's willingness to rejoin the path of Dengist thought, which he eventually will under penalty of death. Nonetheless, Alibaba will press on without him.

In the long run, a rising tide will lift all boats. Both Alibaba and its domestic competitors $PDD, $JD, and others will continue to grow as the sector expands, and as foreign investors gain a better understanding of China. $BABA is uniquely positioned to these other firms, as it has the strongest fundamentals and largest marketshare, with its fingers in about as many pies as a company can. Anti-trust and anti-big business are not synonymous, and Alibaba has done its part to prepare itself for the day when it would inevitably be brought into the fold by diversifying its revenue sources, and cementing itself as THE most important player in China's ascension to world superpower without falling out of favor with China's dominant political denomination.


BABA is literally too big to fail, **if you think it will respect the price floor at $200 and won't be wiped off the face of the earth (which it wont), then most LEAPs are almost all upside**

VSPR is a SPAC merging with aqua-dermabrasion company Hydrafacial.

TLDR for retards it's machine that deep cleans skin.

They sell machines and consumables to spas and clinics. Machine is like $25k and consumables aren't cheap either. Service is generally about $200 a pop and chicks generally end up with multiple / ongoing treatments. Shit is huge here in Asia.

Company generally profitable, despite lockdowns and the like still had a good 2020

CEO of Allergant/Botox - Brent Saunders, will be leading the company post-merger. He is big among the institutional investors and apparently friends with Cramer so our favourite autist will likely give this a good pump closer to merger.

I'm buying because $BECKY.

Positions 6000 commons._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BLNK Blink charging is the biggest EV bubble of them all &#x200B;

[Full Disclosure, My position. 2k in 3-month exp puts.](https://preview.redd.it/2nyudb5ny1861.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6ff95a958a3d5e87a0ed0c69a8bbfe29e806782)

&#x200B;

BLNK Is 100 times overvalued and is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. BLNK is a sinking ship that is being propped up by the EV bubble.

&#x200B;

**Company overview**

>We are a leading owner, operator, and supplier of proprietary electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. We serve both residential and commercial EV charging settings, enabling EV drivers to easily recharge at various location types.  
>  
>Our principal line of products and services is our Blink EV charging network (the “Blink Network”) and EV charging equipment (also known as electric vehicle supply equipment) and EV related services. Our Blink Network consists of proprietary cloud-based software that operates, maintain, and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers and parking companies, who we refer to as our “Property Partners,” with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations payment processing and provide EV drivers with vital station information including station location, availability and applicable fees.

&#x200B;

In short. They make third party EV chargers. A highly competitive space right now.

&#x200B;

**Competition**

Blink faces a lot of competition and are only a small player in the EV charging boom.

Competitors:

* EVgo
* SemaConnect
* Charge Point
* Plug Share
* Megear
* Juicebox
* Mustart
* Ect....

&#x200B;

Blink isn't on the front page of amazon for chargers, and if you look their not even at the top 50. Small fish in a big sea.

[Top EV chargers, Amazon. ](https://preview.redd.it/lu4fxs1xt1861.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3e31011fb16fd466fb8790088edadb637c6f87)

Blink has to be searched on amazon the space is so competitive. Oh yea, and they are giving customers $100 just to buy their product because it's selling so poorly.

[You have to search to find Blinks charger and they offer$100 back to buy it](https://preview.redd.it/gjfoyke9u1861.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=556694bf3b661b169d5d38b6b6cf9a7a7b26ba4a)

&#x200B;

**Blink VS Charge point**

The charge point is planning on becoming pubic and is one of the bigger competitors to blink. Below is a comparison between the two based on data I could find.

||IPO Evaluation|Chargers on network|Total Network|Year Revenue|Mkt Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Blink|50-100m|7000|30,000|1.2m|1.5B|
|Charge Point|1.4-3B|115,000|300,000|147m+|2.4B|

&#x200B;

As you can see. Blink is a tiny player valued like a big player. Charge point is eating blink for breakfast and is only ONE of the competitors in the market.

Compared to charge point, Blink is 100 times overvalued.

&#x200B;

**Revenue and P/S ratio**

Now let us looks at how terrible Blink Charging’s revenue in comparison to their stock price.

PS/ is a company’s market cap/ annual sales. This tells us, roughly, how good a company is at generating cash inflows.

**Below is Apple sitting at a cool 8.3 P/S. A company experiencing all-time highs, and our baseline.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1hj6b62is1861.jpg?width=807&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a1bd56243c32833c4ba97859afc7f084c2bc387

**Here is Tesla at a somewhat high P/S of 25.95. Tesla, the so-called “bubble” by bears, has a PS of 26. Keep this in mind.**

https://preview.redd.it/c4qeklljs1861.jpg?width=790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d9eebf6940df20d8f4d36348048455a0c4135bb

**Now Blink. Blink has a P/S of 348.84. Yes. More than 15 times the PS of Tesla and 40 times Apple. Disgusting gentlemen.**

https://preview.redd.it/vq82xumls1861.jpg?width=797&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d103ed301e2b06dcdbe02a873df492925b0f50d5

**Looking At their income statement it only gets worse.**

Below is the income statement for BLNK. Last quarter BLNK reported 900k revenue in 2020. 760k in 2019. Only a 28% growth YOY for the last quarter. At the current stock price, to match Tesla’s P/S, BLNK needs to increase revenue by 1500% percent and about 4000% to match Apple.

Compared to Apple or Tesla Blink is 150 to 400 times overvalued.

[Statement of cash flow \(From 10q\)](https://preview.redd.it/g7ngx3gss1861.jpg?width=543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c397f14d310927378987290069401ffbb013752)

**Here’s where things go from bad to Nikola fellas.**

Look at operating expenses. In ONE quarter, BLNK paid out 3.6m in salaries in 2020 and 2.2M in 2019. A 60% increase. BLNK is paying their executives so much go dam money, about 10m + per year and it’s increasing while sales stay flat. Because of their ridiculous salaries and bonuses, the company lost 4 million one quarter. Increasing from 2.6 in 2018

&#x200B;

**Where are they getting this money and how are they losing so much?**

Short answer: Dumb investors like us.

Below is the cash flow statement for the last nine months. Highlighted are key parts. As I mentioned above they are losing about 10m per year, highlighted below. Ideally, losses result from investment into company infrastructure to, hopefully, generate more money and profit in the future. This, however, is no the case for BLNK as they are GETTING money from their investments. A sign of decreased spending on the future development of the company. This is a small of where they are getting money, about 2m.

&#x200B;

[Income statement \(from 10q\)](https://preview.redd.it/tf8rwjszs1861.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=893d6537fe377c999c05b3a09220725ce46ed981)

Okay, now onto where they are getting most of their money. Big surprise, from sales of stock. BLNK raised 18m in the sale of stock in 2020. About 17 times their revenue if we're keeping score. So, to make up for a loss of 10m. BLNK sold a fuck ton of shares and sold investments. Leaving them with 14m in cash in the bank to continue to increase the salary and bonuses of the executives.

&#x200B;

**Endless stock sales**

Why not? It is free money and they are making 17 times the amount of selling stock than selling chargers. This stock is a Ponzi scheme.

Below are all the mentions stock sales. Notice how they are using their stock to pay everyone from their supplies to executives. Basically, free money, and the company is laughing to the bank right now.

&#x200B;

**All mentions of stock reimbursements in 10q:**

>“Since April 17, 2020 and through November 11, 2020, the Company has sold 3,566,971 shares of common stock under the ATM program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $19.5 million” (p19 10q)  
>  
>“During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a holder elected to convert 5,125 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into 1,642,628 shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $3.12 per share” (p19 10q)  
>  
>“During April 2020, the Company issued 47,542 shares of common stock with an aggregate issuance date fair value of $87,000 as compensation to certain officers of the Company.” (p19 10q)  
>  
>“During June 2020, the Company issued 10,000 shares of common stock with an aggregate issuance date fair value of $23,500 as compensation to a consultant.” (p19 10q)  
>  
>“During July 2020, the Company issued 6,847 shares of common stock with an aggregate issuance date fair value of $46,560 as compensation to a consultant” (p19 10q)  
>  
>“During April 2020, the Company granted five-year options to purchase an aggregate of 160,416 shares of common stock to executives with an exercise prices ranging from of $1.83-$2.01 per share”  (p20 10q)  
>  
>“During June 2020, the Company granted five-year options to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 shares of common stock to executives with an exercise price of $2.20 per share” (p20 10q)  
>  
>“During September 2020, the Company granted five-year options to purchase an aggregate of 603 shares of common stock to employees with an exercise price of $9.14 per share. The options vest on September 27, 202”  (p20 10q)  
>  
>Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 480,360 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants at an exercise price of $4.25 per share for aggregate gross of $2,041,530 (p20 10q)

&#x200B;

The stock sold by the company ranges between $1 to $9. Based on what the COMPANY thinks its stock is worth, BLNK is 5-40 times overvalued.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts**

Guys. This is a shitty company caught up in the EV hype and is being swept up with the bubble. They were worth $1 a year ago and have gone up 2000% 56 for no reason. The company knows this and is making out like bandits selling stock. Don’t get fucked by this company and actually get into good and strong EV companies.

**Tl:DR**

Blink charging revenue is small as fuck; stock price is large as fuck. The company is making 17 times more money selling stock than actual revenue so the company pays executives and staff insane salaries and stock options> Basically is a Ponzi scheme. Buy puts, short it, or sell gentlemen.

💎✋'ing this bitch._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Palantir is a Solid Long (Software Engineer Perspective) My friend is a software engineer at Google, and he believes Palantir is a solid long based off of the ability of their engineers. The hiring process at Palantir for software engineers is more competitive than Google, Facebook, etc. (or at least as competitive). He said he was rejected by Palantir but hired by Google.

I think among the tech companies, the ones with the highest engineering bar are the smaller companies (often startups), like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir. Google ranks somewhere in the middle difficulty. Then the "easiest" to get in are Amazon and Microsoft. Don't get me wrong though, all tech companies are hard to get in. However, I know that there are a lot of "coasters"/"slackers" in large companies who do the bare minimum etc. Large tech companies try their best to set high bar for entry, but because of the large number of engineers they need, they inevitably lower standards in the long run.

This is especially true of engineers in government... which is the ultimate "monolith" and magnet of mediocrity.

Palantir's competition is other government contractors, and the work done by other government contractors has historically been extremely mediocre. Do you remember the Obama care website that the government paid an absurd $2 billion to make? How about during covid, the state of New York couldn't manage their unemployment website (due to high traffic) by themselves. They needed help from Google to help run the unemployment website from their platform.

From my point of view, there is no way Palantir can lose if they are hiring the best engineers, and if their competition is government contractors.

This is the first DD I've posted here so please tell where I went full tard mode and fucked something up. If this breaks any rules I'm sorry and ill delete this post. 

NuScale Power has developed smaller, safer, cheaper, and more affordable nuclear reactors. In December of 2016 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScales design of small module reactors (SMR's). NuScale was founded with the purpose of being able to construct next generation nuclear reactors in factories. 

The major concern for nuclear power is safety. The 3 Mile Island incident, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all are severe push factors for communities to not invest billions in nuclear reactors. The last nuclear reactors was built in 2016, before that 1996. In 2019 there were 17 shutdown nuclear reactors in various stages of the expensive decommissioning process (this process can cost anywhere from 300 million to 5.6 billion). 

NuScale has come to resuscitate the need for nuclear reactors in a new fashion. Development and research of commercial reactors has largely stopped. Traditional reactors, which cost 7 to 9 billion to produce, make 1 gigawatt of energy (enough to power roughly 1 million homes). However, NuScale has taken a new approach. Their SMR's take up 1% of the space of traditional reactors but only produce 60 million megawatts. However, for 3 billion NuScale can construct 12 SMR's side by side. 

While in the commercial sector advancements for nuclear reactors has largely stopped, this is not true for the military. Since the 1960's the US Navy has sailed 1.7 million miles by nuclear powered ships without a single incident. France gets 75% of its power from nuclear reactors. NuScale represents the American response to commercial nuclear reactor advancements. 

NuScale has improved the safety of their SMR's by removing pumps, valves, and various moving parts and at the same time adding more safety mechanisms to prevent a meltdown (even if one of us retards was in control). Furthermore, they plan to construct their SMR's in factories and ship them to where they need to be reducing the cost. 
NuScale has spent 800 million, much of which comes from its main investor Fluor Corporation (FLR: NYSE). However, it also received 288 million from the Department of Energy to develop its designs. It also has its first customer in Idaho that wants NuScale to start construction on a reactor in 2023. 

There are similar companies that are doing the same thing in Russia and China. America presses on to be the world leader compared to Russia and China, so this competition could lead to more investments into NuScale, especially from a pro near energy president such as Biden. 

For no NuScale is private, but as Biden gets to set his climate change policies NuScale might look to go public to increase funding to expand. For now BHP is an investment that will flourish from not only nuclear energy expansion but also its various other mineral mining ventures. 

This is probably too early to post as there is no talk of NuScale going public, but they are a company that I would keep an eye on over the years and invest in when they go public. 

Positions: 
55 BHP shares

But for more fun: 100 PLTR shares and 30 GME shares

TLDR: No current plays, but watch when NuScale goes public. They make small modular nuclear reactors that can revatilizs nuclear energy in the US. There is no news on them going public, but as Biden invests in green energy and nuclear energy this may change._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I thought stocks only go up? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pretty sure Guy Adami is one of us… _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 250K+ PSTH NON YOLO with 50K+ 50 $30 3/19/21 calls rider - I’ll double both positions if you give me 1000 upvotes - $PSTH 🚀🚀 (I stole the title from the last poster with a tiny 100k position size) &#x200B;

Here are my positions but I had to take out the stocks that wsb doesnt approve of apparently. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Steel Update #4 - consolidation = consolidation $ 4 stocks that will benefit Lots of nervous people out there today with shares/options of $VALE, $CLF, $X, $NUE, $STLD and $MT.

Today was a down day for many steel stocks, while the greater market was up.

Many of these stocks have been parabolic and were due for a "cooling of period" and some consolidation.

Also, if you look, many of the stocks I mentioned were trading at well below the 10-day Average Volume.

**Low volume** pullbacks occur when the price **moves** towards support levels on **lower** than average **volume**. **Low volume** pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact. High **volume** pullbacks suggest that there **could** be a near-term reversal.

This is the true definition of "paper hands".

Weak longs, taking profit.

I was very confident when I first posted and still am on many steel stocks.

Supply remains an issue.

Demand out paces supply and in many cases - order books are pushing 4-5 months out, without prices having been established.

Raw material costs have surged over the past 6 weeks, but iron ore has retreated a little due to China now moving from iron ore to shredded scrap for the main ingredient in their steel making.

[https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/](https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/)

[https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3968389/Search-results/SOUTH-ASIA-STEEL-SCRAP-Import-prices-jump-following-international-price-trend.html](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3968389/Search-results/SOUTH-ASIA-STEEL-SCRAP-Import-prices-jump-following-international-price-trend.html)

The other two large scrap users are the United States and Turkey.

In the US, scrap has increased by $135/ton over the past month - the largest one month increase **IN HISTORY.**

"China essentially sets the global prices for seaborne iron ore. The country could potentially have a similar impact on the Asian steel scrap market.

By comparison, the U.S., the world’s largest single exporter of steel scrap, exported only 18 million tons in 2019 after four years of gradually rising volumes, much of which went to Turkey. Coincidentally, Turkey imported a similar 18.857 million tons in 2019, to the likely upper limit of potential Chinese imports next year.

Would that be enough to move the market and raise global steel scrap prices?

**Yes, almost certainly.**

With China now entering the market for shredded scrap - it is forecasted that prices could jump anywhere from $50-$100/ton in early January.

**OK, so what does this mean for steel stocks and when are they going to reflect what's going on in the market?**

I believe this will begin happening in early January when US manufacturers start reporting earnings and **GIVE STRONG GUIDANCE for 2021.**

$CMC - reports 1/11

$STLD - reports 1/20

$NUE - reports 1/26

$X - reports 1/28

$CLF - reports 2/18

Then we have:

$MT - reports 2/11

$VALE - reports 2/18

Why do I believe there will be surprise revenues, EPS and strong guidance?

Because of a few different factors:

1. The previous quarters reported were some of the worst, with many of these steel companies being impacted by COVID - just like we have seen in this past earnings season for many non-steel companies - the bar was set very low - with the exception of $NUE and $CMC - their EPS came in above expectations - a sign of good things to come.
2. Many mills were shut down or capacity was cut back - it takes time for all of this to come back on-line, this is one of the many reasons that demand is outpacing supply, utilization rates are growing daily.
3. However, once mills get caught back up, which I believe based on today's order books, won't be until late summer, early fall - **the demand will remain HIGH due to low borrowing rates, infrastructure packages for countries around the world, the US housing market continuing to change and the renaissance of suburban/rural America - which will need commercial infrastructure to support the growing populations, re: schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, government buildings - police, fire, courts, etc.**
4. Other countries are staring to become isolationist in their own domestic steel supply and due to skyrocketing costs, India and now Russia are both looking to ban the export of many products made in their own countries.

**Which brings me to this:**

According to Trading Economics website, **global steel prices have increased 15.39 per cent year-on-year, while iron ore prices are up 76 percent during the same period**.

**In China’s Dalian Exchange, iron ore prices have gained 50 percent this year compared to hot-rolled steel’s 20 percent rise**.

The recent increase in steel prices is finally now starting to catch up with the increases in iron ore.

**They are now being passed on pretty much dollar for dollar AND THEN SOME.**

Manufacturers that are vertically integrated like $VALE, $CLF, $CMC and $MT - **will most definitely benefit the most.**

I am now adding **$CMC as an undervalued play on the back of rising steel prices.**

Many don't know $CMC bought all of Gerdau's rebar mills in the United States in 2018.

"Vertically Integrated Business Model: CMC's vertically integrated business model and focus on pull-through volumes **benefits consistent capacity utilization and positions the company as a low cost producer. Approximately 50%-60% of scrap from CMC's recycling operations gets sold to CMC's mill operations**.

**Additionally, nearly 100% of steel supply for its fabrication operations was sourced internally in fiscal 2020**. CMC's recycling facilities are often located in close proximity to mills, resulting in reduced transportation costs. Mills also have a steady and captive source of demand through internal shipments to fabrication facilities leading to consistent utilization rates across these segments.

Fitch believes the company's vertically integrated model also provides some margin resiliency through the cycle. Mills and fabrication operations tend to have lower margins in periods of rapidly increasing scrap prices, whereas recycling operations tend to perform well under the same conditions. The inverse correlation and timing difference of peak profitability during volatile scrap and rebar price environments across different segments helps provide some insulation against price volatility"

**Remember -** $CMC will be the first to report on 1/11.

Their last quarter was a surprise on earnings, with revenues being down due to COVID.

I believe this next one will be a grand slam on revenue (due to higher steel prices and increased volumes) and EPS will be another surprise on the back of being able to benefit on the vertical integration of scrap and taking advantage of a rising market.

Their guidance will most likely be very solid, citing strong order books and demand.

This is also why I like $MT, $VALE and $CLF - vertically integrated suppliers will benefit the most in rising markets - top line and bottom line.

I believe steel stocks will trade in sympathy with what happens on the 11th with CMC and then we have a rising tide reporting for the entire next month until $VALE reports on 2/18.

Again, I like $MT the best due to them being the largest manufacturer in the world, but the vertical integration of $CLF (who $MT has common stock in) $VALE and $CMC are all poised to take a ride on the material rocket that will be 2021.

Lastly, Schnitzer Steel will benefit from the skyrocketing scrap market. Low volume stock, but has the potential to double in short order.

Sorry for the delay in getting this out today - I actually have many jobs/hats I wear and this had to wait.

We are in a consolidation period - have some patience.

If you feel that you want to take profit and put it into something else that is more volatile with larger swings - do it.

I'm confident we see breakouts to 2018 levels on steel stock prices, with potential for a 2008 like spike.

Good Luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Big fish eating up puts while the little guys snack on calls. Market Manipulation confirmed, BTFD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Romeo Power is set to go public through a S P A C $RMG. I've hit $XL and $QS pre-merger and this has a similar feel. Details inside. First off, positions:

\- 4X 35C 2/19

[https://wccftech.com/romeo-power-now-cleared-to-go-public-as-the-shareholders-of-the-spac-rmg-acquisition-have-approved-the-merger-agreement/](https://wccftech.com/romeo-power-now-cleared-to-go-public-as-the-shareholders-of-the-spac-rmg-acquisition-have-approved-the-merger-agreement/)

Key Points:

* RMG Charter Proposals: To change the name of the combined company to Romeo Power, Inc; to modify the capital structure by allowing 250 million authorized common shares as well as 10 million authorized preferred shares; to approve various necessary changes to the amended and reinstated certificate of incorporation.
* NYSE Proposal: To approve the issuance of 95,916,029 RMG Class A common shares with respect to the business combination; to approve the issuance of 16 million RMG Class A common shares to subscription investors.
* The company is an attractive bet for electric vehicle OEMs as its battery packs have a highly flexible architecture, allowing for rapid adaptability and scalability. Moreover, these battery packs are not bound to one cell supplier, eliminating the supplier risk as well as the risk of technological obsolescence.
* As far as the company’s finances are concerned, Romeo Power presently has [contracted revenue](https://romeopower.com/romeo-power-secures-234mm-multiyear-production-contract-w-lion-electric/) of around $310 million, with a further $2.4 billion in revenue currently under negotiation. The company expects to earn annual revenue of $412 million in 2022. However, by 2025, its top-line metric is expected to swell to $1.65 billion, constituting growth of around 300 percent.
   * NOTE: This is particularly interesting to me. Sure, this isn't as novel a battery design as QS but they've already received orders and will, hopefully, be used in 2021.

No guarantees on this but I have a feeling this will do well on the street when they ring the bell on the 30th.

(With my actual username) I, along with my fellow autists here at WSB want to be recognized again, and this time you can have proof as of where GMEs ridiculous profit ER came from. 

So I know some of you are feeling cucked and have been expecting a short squeeze every single day for the last X amount of days...

But here is my DD, and how you can play a role and profit with or without touching the stock. 

You’re confused so let me speak your language

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌛🌜🌝


GameStop offers PowerUp rewards membership.

There is a free tier, and $15 yearly membership tier. 
Buy the $15 membership right now...you’ve lost more money than that in less than 15 seconds today...you’ve spent more money on that for lube and protection around your nearest Wendy’s. 


#If every one of you with positions in GME actually did this, their profit numbers would look ridiculous at the next ER. 

##[Link to Join ($15 for digital; $20 for physical magazine)](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/) 


If you spread this info to other people, many of whom are not aware, they may utilize it and ER would look even better. 

So what does this $15 get you?

A $5 coupon every month that you can use on any item, including gift cards, and online gaming stores. Any of them...all of them. (PSN/ Steam / XLive, N eShop)

**This $5 coupon expires every calendar month. You must use it before the end of the month. If you purchase a gift card, obviously that amount in GC would not expire.**

After 3 months you break even, after the 4th month you have a higher percentage gain than your RH account. 

So you spend $15 for membership, and get $60 in the course of 12 months. 

Your net profit is $45. If every month you pick up a $10 gaming card (PSN/XLive/ N eShop), you only end up paying $5 each month. 

At the end of 12 months, you spent an actual $75, but ended up getting $120 worth of stuff. It’s actually more like $130 because they give you a welcome coupon along with the 1st month’s coupon, plus a birthday coupon as well. 

Use it for yourself, or if you’re not a gamer, save them up and gift it to someone. Or give it to your wife’s boyfriend so he can use it while his dick is chillin during the refractory period.

Remember the coupon expires each month, but if you purchase a GC etc, that amount will not expire. 

Do your part, help out your local GME store by signing up in person if you can. (Don’t risk Covid)

Buy your digital games from their website to improve E-Commerce sales. 

Download their mobile app. 


#ROI from $15 for the average person? 3-4 bagger.

You get a minimum of 300% ROI. $45 pure savings in return for $15.

They throw in $5 as welcome (so 1st month is $10) and $5 for bday. Making it $55 profit. 

Your points add up and you’re bound to hit the $5 off coupon from points reward. Now making it $60 pure saving (75-15 original).

So it’s now a 4 bagger.


#TL:DR;

Buy the $15 (digital magazine) or $20 membership ($20 comes with physical magazine)


This can even pay for your digital games or online memberships to play your games and go 3-37 on CoD.

Thanks for the contribution but damn that username..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 100K+ PSTH YOLO with 10K+ 50 $30 2/19/21 calls rider - I’ll double both positions if you give me 1000 upvotes - $PSTH 🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on Incentive Structures for HF It's been widely reported that not only does Melvin Capital have a significant short position but that their second-largest long position is Alibaba. They have 3.26 million shares an increase from 2.37 million last Q. Melvin Capital has 13.1 billion assets under management. As a non-finance guy, I was wondering what the incentive structure would like for a fund like this? ... Is their exposure to BABA as well as their significant losses in their short position in GME enough to force them to close? Will they be incentived to close before/after the new year for bonuses? I have no idea how the industry works, in terms of bonuses, so was hoping someone could educate me so I could decide whether to buy more GME calls. Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Ford is Primed To double  There's alot of factors going for ford. I know its a boring ass boomer stock, but in a market overinflated nearly everywhere, Ford is being slept on. If you need a good place to park your 6 figure pay day from Tesla, Ford is the place to go. Here's why.

1. Alot of old people died this year, so Ford will be paying out less in Pensions.

Covid killed alot of old people. Giving all those workers 30k a year for life gets expensive. Luckily, alot of those crusty boomers died this year due to the coronavirus, and that'll help that bottom line so they won't have to keep paying crusty old people their checks for 30 years of employment. Pensions were a massive burden so this is a blessing in disguise.

2. They got a new (competent) CEO and their restructuring plan is going well

They played it smart and basically cut production of all of their shitty vehicle lines. Now they took one from the Tesla and Apple playbook and they don't just release an abundance of shitstains with wheels, they did what they did with the Mach-e and the Bronco, and made super nice cars, made a show about it and hyped it up. Kinda like Elon did with the Cybertruck and Semi's and the Roadster and so forth. As of now they only produce their most popular and profitable cars, not shit like the ford Pinto.

Their Old CEO built furniture or some shit and went to the University of Michigan. The new guy went to Ivy league and literally worked his entire life in the Car industry.

3. They are primed for an EV take-off.

They have their electric Vans fleet. They have the Mach-E coming in 2021. They have an all-electric F-150 which they have been hyping up big time. They also have a few other big players coming along with their already full hybrid lineup.

4. Current Dividend yield is sitting at 7%.

They discontinued their dividend as of January due to the corona drop, which IS GOOD because theyre not wasting money on some boomer garbage no one cares about. That money just goes straight to R&D to get some sick new EV's out, and goes to your returns. If you buy stock, and hold it, and the dividend comes back, you can make 7% a year for life as well, if you need a place to park your 6 figure gains from the year.

5. Literally tons of room to run.

It was at 90$ in the dot com bubble. The market cap is insanely low, so we can easily pump this up more. Options are cheap because there's no volatility, but pulling a tesla and buying up tons of options tricks the bots into buying all the stock up and all that.

6. They have had several good quarters this year, meaning the restructuring is actually helping the EPS.

They are finally focusing on profitability and earnings growth instead of revenue and market share. Something like 25% ER growth in China as well.

7. The boomers have a hard-on for it

All the boomers are raising the price on it and saying about how much they love the new restructuring and so forth. "The only EV ill buy is GM and Ford" etc etc. While boomers are idiots, they have alot of money, and love parking it in places like Ford. Get a hype train going on Ford, and the boomers will FLOCK to ford with their boomer money.
