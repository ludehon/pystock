I see people here regret not getting into TSLA as soon as the announcement happened. I mean any sensible person that wants to make money would've got into TSLA on Tuesday/Wednesday of last week. I knew it would hit 600 by inclusion date but didn't think it would go up this much so fast already. To everyone who thinks it's too late, IT'S NOT. GET IN NOW BEFORE IT POPS EVEN FURTHER. 

During my careful analysis of the other tesla posts and comments in this sub, a couple of major indexes has to buy millions of shares before December 21. Now these huge indexes are probably counting on people to paper hands their shares at 450, 500, 550, etc. and buy them up slowly, causing the price to steadily rise. If all us autists who have shares and calls STOP FUCKING SELLING from now on, the indexes will have no choice but to buy at current prices, causing the price to skyrocket. Again, during my extreme analysis with charts and graphs which I cannot post here for confidential reasons, indexes will probably look at the last week before inclusion to buy heavily if they see us not selling.

Honestly, TSLA will probably hit 600 this week and run up to 750 by 12/18. GET IN NOW AND DIAMOND HANDS THIS SHIT.

Everything I said here comes from my ass so do that as you will.

OK, imma keep it short but basically, in this particular part of NKLA's 10Q Q3 report, it is mentioned that on December 1st, approximately 161 million shares of NKLA stock will become eligible for sale.  Most of that stock is owned by insiders and companies affiliated with NKLA. We all know that NKLA is basically fraud at this point, and for that reason, they are trying to push the stock price higher, by only releasing the selected news. They are basically trying to pump the stock up till December 1st. 

It's basically a pump and dump at this point.  If anyone still owns NKLA you gotta get the fuck out. Imama load up on puts.

I think the chances of Palantir expanding it's role in the US government just went wayyyy up.

Interestingly, it was pointed out during the election that Haines mysteriously removed Palantir from her bio:

I've seen lots of sentiment in fresh posts today regrading this subject, might be time for a consensus?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy $LGVW for long term growth. Butterfly Network Inc. said Friday it has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition corporation Longview Acquisition Corp. LGVW in a deal with an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. The combined company will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "BFLY." It will have about $584 million in cash to develop its digital imaging technology.

Butterfly iQ is an ultrasound transducer that can perform "whole body imaging' with a single handheld probe using chip technology that connects to a mobile phone or tablet, the companies said in a statement.

Butterfly's early investors include Baillie Gifford, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited. Butterfly's aim is to make superior medical imaging at more affordable prices. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/medical-imaging-provider-butterfly-network-to-merge-with-spac-longview-in-15-billion-deal-2020-11-20

As of yesterday Ark Funds bought close to 450k shares. I looked up the technology, it looks very exciting. For my research, I found out that an ultrasound machine can cost 500k for a hospital. This hand held device that can plug into an iPhone cost about 2k with a subscription . I don’t expect hospitals to replace their ultrasound machines anytime soon, however, I can see remote usage for this where with AI infusion, you can take your own ultrasound and send it to an on-call Radiologist via video conference call. More importantly, this is will be very useful for emerging countries that can’t afford a 500k ultrasound machine for their hospital.

This is their competitor’s products and how Butterfly compares.

https://epmonthly.com/article/the-butterfly-effect/

TL/DR: Butterfly network will merge with $LGVW. Butterfly network provides iphone ultrasound for  less than 2k with of subscription. (ultrasound machines is around ~500k). Think of massive growth for worldwide since poor countries s can’t afford half a million dollar ultrasound machines.

Gross Profit – Gross profit for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $7.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 14.2%, from $6.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross profit margin was 14.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019, an increase from the 12.8% gross profit margin for the year ended December 29, 2018. Gross profit in the Automation segment increased $2.4 million, or 60.3%, to $6.3 million for a gross profit margin of 17.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $3.9 million with a gross profit margin of 13.1% for the year ended December 29, 2018. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased utilization of personnel.

Revenue – Overall, our revenue for the year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 29, 2018, increased $2.5 million, or 4.5%, to $56.5 million from $54.0 million. Revenue from the Automation segment increased $7.2 million, or 24.0%, to $37.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $29.8 million for the comparable period in 2018. Revenue from the EPCM segment decreased $4.7 million, or 19.5%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $24.1 million for the comparable period in 2018. Our 2019 revenue for the EPCM segment continued to be negatively impacted by the sustained reduction in oil and gas prices and the resulting drop in our clients’ activities in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry. The Automation segment benefited from a significant downstream project awarded in 2019 for the production of clean fuels as required under new international standards in the maritime fuel sector.

Thats right it actually made a profit of 7.9m. With a market cap of 79million, that makes a profit to company valuation ratio of 1:10

Forever grateful for this sub._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Zynga recovery from earnings Right now, we're at the tipping point of a massive COVID-19 wave in the United States. We're rapidly approaching 200k new cases per day and 200+ deaths per day. From New York to LA, more stringent restrictions are being placed on schools, outdoor dining, gyms, and gatherings. In many of these places, outdoor gatherings simply won't be an option: when there's six inches of snow on the ground and it's 10 degrees outside, nobody's going to sit out there with diamond-hard nips thinking "gee this is great we should do this more often". No, these fuckers are gonna head right back inside, order pickup or delivery, and plop their fat asses right back down on the couch. And that's where Zynga comes in.

Zynga's currently sitting at about $8.00. The only reason they ended up this low is because

1. They posted earnings in that magical period of time when beating your expected EPS would tank your stock, no matter what. Their EPS came in above expected, but revenue just below expected meant that investors were disappointed (even though their revenue was up 46% YoY).

2. They acquired Istanbul firm Rollic completely through 200 million in cash, but have not yet included the firm's subscribers and assets on their balance sheet, leading to a loss of 122 million for the quarter. This was actually better than their guidance for Q3 suggested, which was a 160 million loss.
3. People think this pandemic's over. From vaccinations that won't actually start coming to the regular population til 2021 to people just getting sick of social distancing and not seeing their friends, people want this to be over and it's part of why this current wave is so large in the US. People want the pandemic to be over so they think gaming isn't going to be as profitable as it was during the pandemic.

All of these reasons combined ended up dropping Zynga's price from $9.87 on November 4 to $7.95 on November 9 over the course of 2 trading days. That's malarky, and I won't stand for this slander.

Zynga's been big-dicking and acquiring firms through **CASH** for years, and their subscriber numbers have been absolutely pumping. Even after the spring/summer lockdowns have been easing up over time, mobile gaming usage at Zynga hasn't seen a significant decline: it's actually still increasing, and will continue to do so in the winter. CEO Frank Gibeau says they plan on continuing further M&A, which is going to be huge for building subscriber base (which is the highest it's been in six years) and with their user pay up to 436 million up 55% YoY and user pay bookings up to 561 million up 69% YoY (nice), we're looking a nice cozy winter inside playing a lot of mobile and desktop games.

Bonus Round: Santa's about to cram absolute dicktons of new iPhones down everyone's stockings at Christmas. Going to be huge for mobile gaming. Buy Zynga or Krampus will gobble up your dick for misbehaving.

ZNGA 11C 1/15_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Bear Filter - Stop Getting Killed Buying Puts Over the last 9 months of raging bull market, we've seen dozens of separate variations on why the market is about to crash again.  You may have been tempted by any one of them, only to lose your shirt on the next rally.  Here are some filters to evaluate whether a bearish thesis has merit:

**1.  Technical Analysis.**   If it mentions any kind of technical analysis, discard it completely.  The market never goes into bear territory on technicals.  It just doesn't.  Every pullback of 20% or more has a legitimate, fundamental reason that incites fear and caution.  We may see small corrections that ~~astrology~~ TA can predict, but never an actual bear market.  

**2. Covid Concerns.**  Unexpected bad news of unknown and worrisome severity is what drives bear markets.  As far as the market is concerned, this pandemic is over, so stop feeling bearish over it.  We have 3 functioning vaccines and almost anything that happens won't be unexpected or unknown at this point.  Sure, it could mutate to a new disease, explode through the winter, and continue to have a short term impact.  But that possibility is mostly recognized and understood.  What made the market crash at record pace last March was the fear of the unknown, not the actual impact at the time. The impact is worse now than it was then, but we know what is likely to happen and there's little (as far as stocks are concerned) to worry about.

**3.  Macroeconomic Doom.**  Yes, the stimulus cost and federal deficit are huge.  Yes, the Fed's balance sheet is larger than it's ever been.  Yes, inflation and unemployment are always concerns.  But none of these is going to tank the market so don't let them bear down on you.  The overall economic growth prospects for the next five to ten years are incredible and that's going to snuff out whatever concerns exist about deficits and QE.  There is still tons of cash sitting on the sidelines and as economies stabilize, everyone will be pumping it into stocks.  

TL;DR - Stop panic selling, buying puts, or waiting for a rug pull.  We had it in March and if you missed it, hoping for another won't do you any good.

How is everyone seeing this next rally play out?

We still have the record unemployment, we still have the insane amount of money being spent by the government(s).  Outrageous levels of debt now by Canada and US.

Parts of Europe are devastated and will definitely not gain any much needed tourist dollars.

Businesses are still closing in my area.

We all know a ton of money flooded into the US markets and in particular Tech because of the safety factor during COVID.  I think the next correction will be as COVID gets under control and this last massive pump finishes.

Then institutionals and the big market makers will move to more growth orienated areas and back into their home country indexes.  As this happens the retail buyers will freak as they see the prices going down and overreact and pull more out causing a bigger than expected dip.

Operation Warp Speed is using a software platform named Tiberius, which was developed by Palantir, to help local health officials decide where to allocate vaccine doses. The software will help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccines each state will receive, and local officials will use Tiberius to “decide where every allocated dose will go — from local doctors’ offices to large medical centers,” according to a press release.

TUSCAN HOLDINGS CORP.
135 E. 57th Street, 18th Floor
New York, New York 10022
 
NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
 
TO BE HELD DECEMBER 3, 2020
 
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF TUSCAN HOLDINGS CORP.:
 
You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting (the “special meeting”) of stockholders of Tuscan Holdings Corp. (the “Company,” “Tuscan,” “we,” “us” or “our”) to be held at 10:00 a.m. EST on December 3, 2020 at the offices of our counsel, Graubard Miller, 405 Lexington Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10174, for the sole purpose of considering and voting upon the following proposals:
 
 	●	a proposal to amend (“Extension Amendment Proposal”) the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “charter”) to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”) from December 7, 2020 to April 30, 2021 (the “Extended Date”); and
 	 	 
 	●	a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if we determine that additional time is necessary to consummate the Extension (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
 
The Extension Amendment Proposal and Adjournment Proposal are more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement.
 
If you wish to attend the special meeting in person, you must reserve your attendance at least two (2) business days in advance of the special meeting by contacting our counsel, Graubard Miller, at 405 Lexington Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10174, telephone (212) 818-8800. See “Questions and Answers about the Special Meeting — How do I attend the special meeting in person?” for more information.
 
The purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal is to allow the Company more time to complete an initial business combination. The Company’s prospectus for its initial public offering (“IPO”) and its charter provide that the Company has only until December 7, 2020 to complete a business combination. While the Company is currently in discussions regarding business combination opportunities and has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Microvast, Inc., a maker of electric batteries (“Microvast”), our board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before December 7, 2020 to allow the Company to consummate an initial business combination. Accordingly, our board has determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to extend the date that the Company has to consummate an initial business combination to the Extended Date. In the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Microvast prior to the special meeting, the Company will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
 
The purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the Company to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if we determine that more time is necessary to consummate the Extension.
 
The holders of shares of common stock issued in the Company’s IPO (the “public shares”) may elect to convert their public shares into their pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account (calculated as of two business days prior to the meeting) if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented (the “Conversion”). Holders of public shares do not need to vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal or be a holder of record on the record date to exercise conversion rights. The per share pro rata portion of the trust account on the record date after taking into account taxes owed but not paid by such date (which is expected to be the same approximate amount two business days prior to the meeting) was approximately $10.22. The closing price of the Company’s common stock on the record date was $10.15. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the meeting, exercising conversion rights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $0.07 more than if the stockholder sold such shares in the open market. However, the actual market price on the redemption date may be higher or lower than the per share pro rata portion of the trust account on such date. Additionally, the Company cannot assure stockholders that they will be able to sell their common stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the conversion price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $THCB possibly moving merger date to April 30, 2021 Since lot of ppl bought today, this might get stuck in the comments so wanted everyone to know

If you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds.

And here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.

So why does this matter?

Well, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy low sell high with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued.

There are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum).

This is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.

So thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets. The memes are now real and you are now the captain of Wall Street.

Edit: to all the morons who keep saying I am wrong because passive is not 90% of the market. Yes it’s more like 60-65(passive) 35-40 (active) right now. But what drives price action is the marginal buyer and seller. The total market doesn’t matter worth shit. Grandma with her 20 shares of Ford she plans to gift to Timmy 10 years down the line doesn’t move market price today. 90%+ of the marginal Flow of money today is passive and that sets the price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I’ve been feeling every morning past few days, when I wake up and check on my TSLA calls _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who here owned shares in VTIQ before it became NKLA?

Thanks retards_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ is XPEV & NIO still the MOVE or nah... i listened to you autist & i'm getting railed. should i dump these two or grab my nuts and double down._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV stocks. A quick rundown. Ok. Listen up retards i've been doing a lot of trading in EV and EV related stocks and they've made me a LOT of money. 

You want to make money on EV stocks? Buy NIO? Hell no! Buy LI? Hell no! Buy Tesla? Maybe.  These stocks for the most part have had their run, is there run left? Maybe, maybe even probably, but at this point you are trying to time the top. 

THIS is how you can make the big tendies.  SPAC EV stocks at or near NAV.  There are a few of them out there right now that are ripe for the picking.  

Here are a few examples of plays that have paid off bigtime for me.

NIO (not an SPAC stock but got in around $17.00 which was a little high for my liking).
LI (got in at around $16 which was again a little high for my liking but I figured i'd give it a shot)

SBE - got in at $11.50 currently at $35
HYLLION - got in at $12 currently at $25 (I sold around 38)
RIDE - in at 10.80 now at 27
KCAC - in at $13 now at 21
CIIC - in at $13 now at 26

The list goes on but you get the point.

What's the key? Get in near the bottom, most of these stocks had a floor of about $10-10.50 since they could be cashed out if you chose to.  Sure, there have been some that haven't hit yet (I'm looking at your HCAC/Canoo!)

Right now I still have hope for HCAC (i've averaged my cost to 10.35 so there's no chance of actually losing anything on this).

A lot of these I didn't even get in at the very bottom of NAV (most around $10-10.50) but after a 30% run-up or more. 

Do your own due diligence and find these gems, they are right there and everyone is always talking about them.  Don't be the chump that jumps in on NIO at 40 sweating it. Be the one that got in at the ground floor. 

Plays i'm also in that are currently close to NAV (for those of you too lazy to do your own homework).   

THCB $10.80
GIK $10.88
NBAC 11.90
HCAC $11.18

These are the ones that i'm mainly in at the moment.  These all have very little downside but I see a huge potential upside.

PLTR _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FactSet news on $PLTR entirely from SA. Seeking Arrangements. Don’t trust em hoes but still love $PLTR. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We are the market. These old bulls have slowly started to plow into the forest and don't realize why they keep running. Earnings per share? How are the old-growth stocks doing? Don't get me wrong, for the investors, and that's the keyword of this post, INVESTORS, who gave their cash to companies, decades ago, to see them grow like IBM, telecom stocks (ATT), computer hardware and software companies, tobacco (MO), pharma (CVS, PFE), big oil (XOM), whatever else you can picture with mud still clinging to its old shaking knees is exactly what the old bulls formerly bought into so that they could experience life in SPCE.

Those great companies that still bring in revenue are dependant on Earnings Per Share and other boring but essential metrics to watch those slow-ass crops of old grow what little percentage points they still can. So do we care about Earning per Share? Yeah marginally, of course, we want to make a rate of return that beats inflation. Cash gang is almost Bi-🌈🐻. But what is the original idea behind investing other than the giant Plutocrats that need a place to sit on their Bi-🌈🐻 cash-mountain while they wake up not knowing why they are still alive and the game hasn't restart? Well, it's to give cash to the finite producers of the world to watch them fucking grow.

I swear every other old bull is historically embarrassed they were once us and investing in shit that aimed for the moon while it was still in a garage. Now we have to remember for them because they are old bulls and old bulls sometimes forget to fucking plow. They may be sitting on their cash Bi-🌈🐻 hills now and not looking towards the horizon and starting to face plant into the dirt, but we're still ready to bust one for the future.

So why do we hear about pump and dump when it's really pump and pump? We decide where the market goes. We get to invest in whatever we decide is the future of the Earth-Mars marketplace.

Snowflake was trading at $300 on Oct 22(then went back to 250 in just a couple of days), that was definitely a squeeze. And the stock went up 20% in the last 7 trading days, so we are in another squeeze.

$SNOW one of the most overvalued stock in the market, has a daily short volume of greater than 50%

http://shortvolumes.com/?t=SNOW

Valuation: 
Company is valued at 76 billion (at the current share price of $280) with only a revenue 133m, comparing to NIO that has a revenue of 666.6m last quarter, valued at 72 billion (at the current share price of $53)

Company:
Snowflake is a software company that helps the user managing their data. If for example, you have multiple database on AWS and Azure, you can use snowflake to run analyses and query any of those data. It's essentially a csv parser that depend on AWS and Azure.


Shares:
Currently, there are 278M shares outstanding, with 28M shares float (IPO shares), some of the IPO shares(4M) are bought by Berkshire. And some are bought by ETFs and other institutions. So the actual shares available to trade is very small. The price are high due to demand greatly exceeds the supply. 

** But that is about to change** , on December 16th, 91st day after the date of the prospectus
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162828020013667/snowflake424b4.htm

> All of our current employees with a title below vice president, current contractors, former employees (other than Robert L. Muglia, our former chief executive officer, and his affiliates), and former contractors may sell a number of shares equal to 25% of (i) outstanding vested shares and (ii) shares subject to vested stock options and RSUs, each held by such holder or held by trusts for the benefit of such holder or of an immediate family member of such holder, and calculated as of the date of release (Vested Holdings). As of July 31, 2020, 25% of the outstanding Vested Holdings held by such holders was **11,295,695** shares.

And there's more, if after December 15th, out of the 15 trading days, if there are at least 10 trading days where the stock price was higher than **$159.6**, then more shares will be unlocked

> All other non-employee stockholders who are not members of our board of directors or our affiliates (including Mr. Muglia) and whose shares were not included in the First Release, may sell a number of shares equal to 25% of their Vested Holdings. As of July 31, 2020, 25% of the outstanding Vested Holdings held by such holders was **37,904,494** shares. 

Once these shares are unlocked, the snowflake bubble will burst. Smart money bought at the IPO price of $120, they are not buying them at $280.

DD below:  
- Hiring like crazy for enterprise division. Watch a video from the head of HR here: https://jobs.lumen.com/global/en   
- "We are furthering human progress through technology. Our amazing people are helping our companies do amazing things." What's not amazing about that?   
- But seriously, they have over 110 positions open in technology and 20 in project management   
- 142 Sales and Marketing jobs  
- Only 41 other non tech jobs  
- So basically, tech and selling the tech. They are not slow stepping here and that's what I think Michael Burry saw.   
- Check out their new site at www.lumen.com which is already getting 210,000 visitors a month (up from 2000 visitors on launch in august or 10,000% growth)
- As our government and tech overlords continue to expand, the non tech companies will need a savior and that savior is Lumen. The same way PLTR is sucking up all the surveillance business, LUMN will suck up all the transformation business for big enterprises.   
- Look at their featured customers: Salesforce, Zoom  
- Now for some financials:  diluted EPS was $0.34 vs. $0.28 in 2019 and management says they are committed and focused on EPS with a three year goal of saving $800-$1b a year  
- Next quarter they are going to way outperform in both actual numbers and sentiment because they will start to show growth rather than decline    
- And Michael Burry's 800,000 are going to triple in value.

A SPAC that's about to pop in the EV world. Easily $20 EOY.

&#x200B;

Commons have a trade-in-value at $10. Therefore max downside today ($10.70) is around 8%. With unlimited upside. Warrants are 2 warrants per share, $18.50 they are redeemed, they are good for 5 years after the merger is complete.

&#x200B;

The management team for $THCB is very strong: Stephen Vogel is the head of it. [https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-vogel-8a126060/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-vogel-8a126060/)

He's been in the PE/Investments world for 40 years, this is his 3rd SPAC.

&#x200B;

Potential concerns is if the deal doesn't go through the board will have to vote to extend the SPAC's merger deadline in December. I don't see this happening as things seem to be moving forward with Microvast and management doesn't receive any compensation if they don't finalize a deal.

&#x200B;

My play is commons and warrants. I wouldn't buy up the FD's for Dec, but hey you're all degenerates.

&#x200B;

Some of you may remember that after they IPO'd earlier this year, they skyrocketed to $63+ before Citron report said they were frauds. Besides fundamentals, the fact that Andrew Left is against them should be convincing enough for you to buy in.

They have an announcement this week and a MASSIVE dip today, after continual growth since they stated they were coming out with some news this weekend. My only regret is I didn't buy earlier but I'm loaded with $50c 12/18.

Thank me on Monday and DO NOT SELL until early December once it goes $60+ as the big boys will buy on next week. Also, no hedge fund that has positions in it has sold, 0. Let me repeat that, 0 of the big boys have left their positions since it IPO'd.

Robinhood gave me their own $1000 to play around with while they were trying to take the money from my bank. 

With the $1000, I spent it all on TSLA $700c 11/13. I bought them the day before the options were going to expire. I really thought it was going to hit $700.

Long story short, I lost all the money, and Robinhood wasn’t able to take the $1000 from my bank account (since I didn’t have it). Now I’m NEGATIVE $997 in my account and I haven’t logged on. What happens if I just abandon this Robinhood account?

Since September it’s been the most exhausting 7 weeks of trading for me. As a fellow autist, I jumped in on the Tesla fomo after I had made 10k pre-split. 

Bought $460 calls thinking it would be an easy scalp although IV and premiums were high at the time... 

Turned out to be a terrible decision. Through October, I was down -80% on my calls, roughly 45k, which was difficult to stomach. I thought there was no way to come back from it and that I would lose my full 55k. 

Fast forward to today - I broke even plus some...I sold even if I am leaving money on the table at this point. It was one of those trades that I just needed to get out of to feel like I could give my mental a break. 

So, I’ll say this to all you autist - you can always come back. I learned so much and feel so humbled. Such a tough 2 months but worth it for the lessons which are:

- Don’t fuck with options unless you know your shit. I am fairly seasoned and knew the risk but when you see a portion of your net worth vanish in 3 weeks, it stings. 

- If you fuck with options, know your play and do it with conviction. Also, hedge. I was way too cavalier and didn’t deserve to even break-even.

- It’s okay to be a short term bear even if you like the stock in the long run. Don’t ever marry a position and admit you have bias. Be realistic about what your entry and exit will be. Don’t just go full YOLO with 🚀 and 🌙 emojis. Don’t jack off to gain porn - 9 out of 10 traders lose. Start small and build it up through thoughtful analysis, unless you like loss porn. 

That’s it. I wish everyone in this sub good luck and a great Thanksgiving. Keep making the tendies Boiz, but not at the expense of your mental health.

This is reflected in the stock, down 50% YTD. If this thread has taught me anything over the last year, it is to bet against these people. 

 Their justification: solar farms, bioenergy, and **electric vehicles**. Their flaw is that there has been no quantum leap in alternative energy over the last few years, carbon is still the cheapest source of energy and emerging markets are investing massively in carbon, and all our new EV is still going to get powered by burning fossil fuels (it will just be in a plant several miles away). 

No one thinks there is going to be a carbon-free future for a long time.

**Investment Thesis for Metromile - $INAQ**

**Summary**

* Insurance is an important enabler of economic growth and represents hundreds of billions of market cap.
* Pricing insurance is antiquated. Data is now proliferating in ways that should change pricing and risk.
* We need to move from a world of static, approximated rates for large groups of people to personalized dynamic rates for individuals based on their own behavior.
* Insurance startups are finding scale through online acquisition of customers, better risk-based pricing, and more efficient servicing of its products.
* These inefficiencies of pricing and go to market are creating an innovator's dilemma for incumbents.

&#x200B;

**Qualitative**

* One-third of drivers drive most of the miles and get in most of the accidents. Despite this, they pay the same rates as everyone else. As a result, two-thirds of drivers are overpaying for auto insurance.
* Metromile's personalized per-mile insurance fits better in a world where more people are switching to work-for-home, using ridesharing more often, and using autonomous vehicles - every mile is unique and insurance should adjust accordingly.
* Metromile makes dynamic per-mile insurance easy with multiple options for sharing data and capturing savings:
   * Mobile app that provides savings insights before you signup and useful features after you signup.
   * A dongle that you install in your car which measures your driving behavior and allows you to get cheaper insurance rates as it learns about your driving habits
   * OEM relationships with car manufacturers that allows you to send your real time driving data to Metromile (initially Ford but likely to increase to all OEMs as cars become Internet connected)
* Metromile's claims service is fully automated, reducing fraud, hassle and cost to consumers.
* Metromile's business model allows it to grow in three powerful ways:
   * B2C: sell insurance to people with best in class unit economics and efficient customer acquisition
   * B2B2C: work with auto OEMs (ie Ford) to access telemetry APIs, get real-time driving data, price risk in real time, and then upsell cheaper insurance to the car owner.
   * B2B: license core risk engines to other insurance companies to improve their claims experience, reduce fraud, and improve operating margins, while getting paid on a per policy basis.
* Metromile saves customers more than any other insurer (\~47%). As a result, CAC is lower, LTV is high.
* Unlike competitors (Root and Lemonade), Metromile has already achieved profitable unit economics - they do not need to raise rates to get profitable or figure out how to cross-sell other products to make money.

&#x200B;

**Quantitative**

* Top level metrics:
   * 47% savings vs competitors
   * 18% contribution margins and growing
   * $1,000+ annual premiums
   * LTVICAC of 2-3x and growing

&#x200B;

* **Competitive Positioning**
   * Metromile one-year retention is best in class at 63%, Lemonade is 62%, Root is 33%
   * Metromile loss ratio is best in class at 59% (YTD). Root (2019) is 100% while Lemonade is 79% (2019)
   * Metromile contribution margin is best in class 15% (Q3 2020) while Lemonade (est) is 13% and Root (est) is -38%,
* High-margin B2B enterprise software business on-track to deliver $48 million in 2024E Revenue

Here’s what I know about Q4 - 

Target will continue to increase market cap, still under $90B, it remains one of the cheapest retailers in the S&P500.  

With partnerships across multiple entities, and a supply chain that’s best in class, I don’t see many reasons to dislike this stock.  To name a few - CVS, Ulta, Shipt, Overstock, Bed Bath and Beyond.  

Target is taking market share from all of their partners, it’s a natural cannibalizarion, and it will likely continue for some time.  

Target is taking market share from its competitors, mainly WMT and AMZN, as they succeed in the tech space, and the retail space.  

The main competitor which will hurt Target is Costco, which to me, feels like more of a threat to WMT, than TGT.  Why?  Karen.  

Karen loves Target.  There’s high enough margins on goods, that it keeps most of the poor people at WMT.  

Karen also likes Wholefoods, but she only shops there for special things.  She knows she can get a 10% discount for most of the name brands at Wholefoods vs Target.  

Karen has a RedCard.  The 5% she saves on all transactions, plus free shipping makes it a staple in her wallet.  

Karen uses the Target app or Shipt.  Maybe not as much as AMZN, but it’s on her Home Screen.  

Karen likes Target pickup.  During a pandemic, nothing is easier that getting your apples brought to your car.  

Karen has unlimited buying power, and is a customer who doesn’t often change shopping habits.  

Karen is going to buy a bunch of Christmas candles and nonsense decor, where do you think she’s going to purchase it?  

Karen likes that there’s a Starbucks in the store, it’s the main reason she came, but she’ll buy groceries for her kids while she’s here.

1. Novavax (NVAX) is slightly behind Pfizer/Moderna/AZN/JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the **most effective vaccine** with the **fewest side effects** and will be the **easiest to distribute,** as if only requires standard refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius).
2. Many people think that the \~95% efficacy data from PFE/MRNA means that we're in the clear, but the data refers to 95% prevention of **symptomatic disease and not 95% prevention of infection**, which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked. **Based on pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical data, I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease, but also better at preventing infection and transmission.**
3. Importantly, NVAX's COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2327) is the **only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long-term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations** providing a convenient option in the likely scenario that annual COVID boosters are recommended.
4. The mixed results of yesterday's AZN interim update create a buying opportunity for NVAX, as AZN's vaccine candidate was a major competitor as the other low cost, easily distributed vaccine for most of the world. Another near term catalyst within the next 1-2 weeks is an interim update from the Phase 3 UK trial that began in September. Buyout rumors are yet to be substantiated, but NVAX is an attractive acquisition candidate with a market cap of only $6B.

**Bottom line:** I think $NVAX is being overlooked due to the recent wave of vaccine news but will end up being the clear vaccine of choice for most of the world and will significantly outgrow it's current $6B market cap. I think short-term catalysts (Phase 3 interim updates, potential buyout) will drive the price higher in the next couple of weeks and like the long-term outlook (global vaccine distribution, annual flu/COVID combo vaccine, potential buyout). **This stock has low float and one piece of positive news will send this back to at $120.**

&#x200B;

# DISCUSSION (skip if you're not interested in the science)

**Why I think $NVAX will produce the most effective vaccine and why this matters**

One of the most important correlates of protection used to estimate vaccine efficacy is the amount of antibodies the vaccine generates in the host, also referred to as **antibody titer** (high titer = high levels of antibody). **NVAX has reported significantly higher antibody titers than any of the other candidates in phase 3 trials: \~6-fold higher than MRNA, \~10.8-fold higher than PFE, and \~10.5 fold higher than AZN** (see graph below; source: [RA capital](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_11062020_D.pdf?v=XM0HdrTJDriIT5wg2aGibyy_vnxZt0mIHMi3grCiQ0A)).

&#x200B;

Small differences in antibody titers shouldn't be overinterpreted, however large differences are more likely to be meaningful and correspond with measurable differences in real-world changes in immunity. **Based on the titer data reported to date, we would expect NVAX to have the highest efficacy.**

&#x200B;

[Note the log scaled y-axis](https://preview.redd.it/qzig6e3de4161.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e50ae47c7ea372247e97cc22fa0176f3cf7497)

&#x200B;

More convincing support for NVAX comes from primate challenge studies in which rhesus macaques were given vaccine or placebo and then exposed to the virus. **Monkeys vaccinated with NVX-CoV2327 had zero evidence of viral replication in either the upper or lower airway, whereas monkeys vaccinated with MRNA's vaccine (the most effective vaccine reported to date) had evidence of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways (see graphs below; top graph is NVAX, bottom graph is MRNA).**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sq47cz58n4161.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=655951710581046b64d769dc3bfc581ce9da007e

**Bear with me, but this data is significant for reasons that require a bit of explanation**. First, it's important to understand that protection in the upper airway (i.e. nose/throat) from COVID infection is more challenging to achieve than in the lower airway (i.e. the lungs) with intramuscular injected vaccines. This matters because a vaccine that only protects the lungs without also protecting the upper airway will likely prevent severe disease in the lungs but may not prevent viral infection ([reference](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096693v1)). In other words, it might prevent a person from getting really sick but it won't prevent them from transmitting the disease to others.

&#x200B;

Based on Moderna's challenge data shown above, their vaccine seems to fit the profile of mostly preventing infection in the lungs combined with a lesser degree of protection in the upper airway (at least in rhesus macaques). Now, you might say who cares about a primate challenge study if we have real-world clinical trial data in humans that says the vaccine is 94.5% effective? The reason I care is because all of the interim numbers that have been reported to date refer to the **efficacy of preventing symptomatic cases only and not of preventing infection** ([source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy)). This is a huge deal and is almost certainly not the way that the public has interpreted the headlines to date. (UPDATE: this exact point was addressed by Moderna's CMO this morning [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-chief-medical-officer-vaccines-interview-2020-11)).

&#x200B;

If we assume that the non-human primate challenge data presented above is representative of what will happen in humans then I think the efficacy numbers that are being thrown for around for Moderna (and likely Pfizer/AZN) don't tell the full story and **I suspect that the sentiment about the efficacy of these vaccines will change over time**. Again, you might ask who cares - this level of efficacy still sounds really good and I completely agree that it's impressive for first generation vaccines made in under a year. These vaccines will be important for rapid immunization of high risk groups and I would gladly take one knowing everything I know now if I was high risk. However, I expect that this overlooked issue of **disease prevention versus infection prevention** for the PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccine candidates will start getting more air time. Even if it doesn't, the infection data (rather than just the symptomatic disease data) will eventually be released as a secondary endpoint for these trials at some point in the next couple of months.

&#x200B;

Unlike Moderna's challenge study, **NVAX provided complete protection in both the upper and lower airway,** ***despite using a higher viral challenge dose***\*\*. This fits with the superior antibody titer data and leads me to believe that there is a high probability that NVAX will not only have a higher rate of reduction in symptomatic cases but may also provide sterilizing immunity in a large subset of patients, therefore not only preventing disease but also preventing transmission in a subset of patients\*\*. If the challenge data ends up translating in humans - and I think it will - then NVAX will end up having a significantly superior vaccine to the others currently in Phase 3 trials. The potential for NVX-CoV2327 to also prevent infection instead of only preventing symptomatic disease is a big deal and is why I think NVAX is going to become the vaccine of choice even though they are a bit behind their competitors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Who cares if NVAX ends up with a more effective vaccine if the others will be available first?**

NVAX will probably miss part of the first wave of vaccinations for front line workers and high risk individuals if the current timelines hold, but this is a small group of people. However, I anticipate we'll get an interim update from NVAX's Phase 3 UK trial in the next couple of weeks and for all the reasons outlined above, **it will be clear that NVAX has the best vaccine well BEFORE the majority of people have been vaccinated**.

&#x200B;

NVAX is targeting having 100M doses ready by the end of 2020 and will be producing hundreds of millions of doses per quarter beginning 1Q 2021, reaching an annual run rate of 1 billion doses per year by the end of 2021 ([source](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)). NVAX has an agreement in place from the UK to purchase 60M doses and an agreement with Canada to supply up to 76M doses. NVAX has an exclusive licensing agreement to produce 1B doses for India and other countries in the developing world and has a partnership with Takeda to produce 250M doses per year for Japan. **As a result, I anticipate that NVAX will also have the supply to be able to capture a significant portion of mass vaccination efforts.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I think there is a high probability that annual COVID booster shots will be recommended for most people for the foreseeable future and if so, NVAX stands to benefit the most.**

Due to the novelty and severity of COVID-19, I think it's highly likely that periodic (if not annual) boosters of a COVID vaccine will be recommended for most people, especially those in high risk groups. There are several reasons that NVAX will be the primary beneficiary in this scenario - I'll begin by explaining why it's unlikely that the current crop of competitors will be suitable for this application:

1. mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) are very painful and I suspect that people vaccinated with them on the first round will be hesitant to get in line and take them again once other more traditional options are available. They're also more expensive per dose and have additional cold chain/logistical challenges.
2. Vector-based vaccines like AZN/JNJ cannot be re-administered due to vector-based immunity. Your immune system develops an response against the vector itself leading to limited efficacy in subsequent doses.

&#x200B;

NVX-CoV2327 on the other hand, has none of these downsides and is well suited for use in this context. Furthermore, NVX-CoV2327 has the potential to be multiplexed with a flu vaccine into a single shot which is an extremely attractive option. Flu vaccinations will probably become even more important in the future with COVID circulating and getting people to take one shot instead of two increases the probability of compliance. NVAX makes a flu shot (Nanoflu) that reached all primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial and is being submitted for accelerated FDA approval. Nanoflu uses the same adjuvant as NVX-CoV2327 so the potential for being able to multiplex the two vaccines is high. **The bottom line is that NVAX has the potential for a significant stream of recurring revenue from COVID booster shots that PFE/MRNA/AZN do not have**. A multiplexed flu shot would be the icing on the cake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# CONCLUSION

1. The market is underappreciating the the fact that interim vaccine data has shown 95% effectiveness of **preventing symptomatic disease and not 95% effectiveness of preventing infection** and therefore transmission. In my opinion, NVAX will be significantly better in this regard and be in high demand if/when this distinction is made.
2. NVAX will not only be the most effective vaccine but will be the best COVID vaccine investment due to it's high total addressable market (favorable cost/distribution) and potential for recurring revenue, in conjunction with only a $6B market cap (Moderna has a $39B market cap).
3. Interim update of Phase 3 UK data represents a significant near-term catalyst. Potential for acquisition cannot be ignored.

&#x200B;

I probably missed a few things but this has taken way too long and I need to go back to work. I will do my best to answer any questions.

Thank you for your time.

**Update #1:**

A few people have commented about my use of December calls and how this doesn't align with the DD that I outlined. Here's my logic:

1. The phase 3 trial in the UK began in September and the first interim update will be provided once a total of 66 cases have been observed. Based on the daily case load observed in the UK since September, the trial should hit the 66 case threshold very soon (1-2 weeks) and we'll be getting an update that I think will lead to a huge pop.
2. With the subpar data from AZN released yesterday, one of the other low-cost/easily shipped vaccines looks like much less of a threat and I'm more comfortable holding December options while I wait for the interim update to happen.
3. None of this takes away from how I feel about the long-term prospects; ideally I will profit from these December calls and then roll some of that forward and buy shares.

It's risky but it will pay off huge if we get an announcement in the next 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

**Update #2**:

I mentioned that mRNA based vaccines are painful and that I think it won't play well with the public. Well here's an [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html) I missed from CNBC talking about exactly that point with mRNA vaccines.

I think this is a needle-mover and isn't being talked about. The type of person to volunteer for a vaccine trial is very different than the subset of people in the country that are already reluctant to take a COVID vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter. Once we start vaccinating non-trial participants I think this is going to get more coverage and take some wind out of the sails of Pfizer and Moderna.

I hope you are all enjoying this wonderfully green day.

After PLTR reached $20 yesterday u/ZanderPerk \- a stranger from this subreddit - gave me $400 USD to cover the costs of my PS5. I already have the console in hand, and there is a custom bumper sticker coming in his honour. You can read the full story here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend\_of\_the\_wsb\_ps5\_i\_promise\_to\_pay\_pltr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend_of_the_wsb_ps5_i_promise_to_pay_pltr/)

As promised, I will be paying it forward and giving some other lucky Palantir bull a Digital Edition PS5 if PLTR’s stock price reaches $30.00 this year. Here is how it will work:

The day Palantir touches 30.00 (before the end of 2020) I will come back to WSB and post a form for you to enter the draw. The winner will then be contacted and we will arrange for you to get your PS5 as soon as possible.

And it gets better.

It must be the season of giving, because another generous redditor - u/degenerate-hotdog has reached out to me and offered to cover the costs of TWO other PlayStation 5’s.

That’s right. There are **THREE** **PLAYSTATION 5**’s being given away if Palantir hits $30 this year.

&#x200B;

# FAQ:

&#x200B;

**How do I enter?**

When Palantir hits $30, I will post a form on this subreddit for you to complete to enter the draw. Messages sent to me and comments in this or other threads do not count as entering the draw. The winner will be selected directly from the survey results.

&#x200B;

**What information will be required to enter?**

The form will only ask for your 1) reddit username, 2) an email address and 3) your selection of a number between 1 and 1,000,000. Do not give anyone any other information who may be posing as someone who is part of this draw. I will be doing the draw, and those are the only 3 details I will be asking for. <- This part is important. Don’t get scammed.

&#x200B;

**How can I find the post to enter?**

There are three ways to ensure you don’t miss the post. You can follow me on reddit and get notifications about when I post. Also, when Palantir reaches $30, the post will be titled “$PLTR - WSB PLAYSTATION 5 DRAW”. I will also update THIS post with a link to the draw.

&#x200B;

**What exact price action will trigger the draw?**

If Palantir touches $30.00 USD before the end of 2020 the draw will occur. That means that even if it touches and then retreats, the draw will still occur.

&#x200B;

**How will the draw be done?**

There will be a 48 hour window from when the post is created to enter. I will post the exact draw closing time in the post. When entry closes, I will remove the link to the entry form from the post. After all entries have been collected, I am going to log into World of Warcraft, on a character aptly named Palantir. I will then use the World of Warcraft loot rolling system to roll for a random number between 1 and 1,000,000. This rolling system is entirely random. I will “/roll 1000000” ONCE and then I will check that number against a spreadsheet of all the entries. Whoever is closest will win. The entire WoW draw and spreadsheet lookup process will be recorded and I will post it on YouTube. Winners will be announced on the draw post, along with the recording of the draw process.

&#x200B;

**How many winners will there be?**

There will be 3 winners. The closest 3 numbers will be given a console. However, I only personally guarantee the console for the first closest number. The second and third consoles are u/degenerate-hotdog’s responsibility.

&#x200B;

**How will winners be contacted?**

Winners will be contacted via email and reddit private message, using the addresses and usernames collected via the form.

&#x200B;

**What if they don’t respond?**

You will have 7 days to respond before I move on to the next winner.

&#x200B;

**What if** u/degenerate-hotdog **changes his mind?**

That’s unfortunate.

&#x200B;

**What if there is a tie?**

In the event that two numbers are the same distance from the drawn number and there is a tie, whoever can prove to me that they were bullish on Palantir first wins. A bullish reddit post about why you like the company will suffice, as there are no financial requirements for this draw.

&#x200B;

**How will the winner get their PS5?**

The PS5 that I am giving away will be ordered from Amazon, Walmart, Bestbuy or Gamestop straight to an address of your choosing. If you don’t want to reveal your personal address, we can send it to a post office box or your place of work. Alternatively, we can try to set up in-store pick up.

With regards to u/degenerate-hotdog, he has told me that he wants to do GameStop gift cards instead. In any case, I will do my best to put the second and third place winners in touch with him, and how you get your prize from him is between the two of you.

&#x200B;

**What if we can’t get one because they are all sold out?**

We will try to get one for a couple of weeks. If we are struggling to get one, I will send you an appropriate gift card valued at $400 USD.

&#x200B;

**What if some unforeseen challenge prevents us from getting a PS5 sent to me?**

I will send you a gift card, intended to be used on a PS5.

&#x200B;

**Will you buy a more expensive one from a scalper?**

Negative. Regular price from a reputable retailer only.

&#x200B;

**Who qualifies?**

In order to qualify you must be over the age of 18, a member of this subreddit and you must be bullish on Palantir.  Your reddit account must be older than this post, so you cannot create new accounts to enter multiple times. You do not have to own a security or option relating to Palantir, but bulls are encouraged to participate. I am not sure that I can legally provide kickbacks to individuals, so I am choosing to just remove the position requirement to be safe. You must also reside in a country that receives shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.

Please do not enter if you or your family members will not play the PS5. These things are in high demand. 

&#x200B;

**Do I have to get a PS5?**

Yes.

&#x200B;

**Can I pay the extra to get a disc edition?**

Yes, but you will have to send me $100 USD plus transfer fees first.

&#x200B;

**Can I get an xbox?**

No. Xbox sucks.

&#x200B;

**Can I get cash instead?**

No.

&#x200B;

**What does the winner have to do?**

Winners will be asked to please post a picture of their PS5 on WSB and tag myself and u/degenerate-hotdog in it. We would also strongly encourage you to pay this forward at the next aggressive Palantir price target or resistance point.

&#x200B;

**Is this legal?**

There are no laws preventing me from giving away gifts, and I am not requiring you to take any trading action to enter this draw. So yes. This is legal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market is open but closes early on Friday Market closes at 1pm EST keep this in mind you sleeping in autist fucks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some nice steel gains (mainly 100 CLF $10.5 11/27) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Grimes appreciation day They say behind every great man is an even greater woman.

With Elon rising to #2 on the world's wealthiest list, it's time we take a closer look at Grimes.

Grimes, born Claire Boucher, met Elon where he spent most of his days, on Twitter.

The couple quietly began dating, as activist short shorts Einhorn loudly spread FUD.

Elon was quoted saying he loves Grimes for her "wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic".

Shortly after, she encouraged Elon to blaze a blunt with Joe Rogan, announcing taking TSLA private at $420.  Funding secured. He later admitted he picked the $420 share price as a joke to amuse Grimes, according to the SEC.

At this point, the short shorts were drooling and the barbarians were at the gate.  

With the Grimes' creative direction, Musk recorded RIP Harambe on his new Emo G soundcloud account.
https://m.soundcloud.com/user-209448905/rip-harambe1

Finally as short interest was at an all time high, Elons master squeeze was ready.  And squeeze he did, all the way to a 5:1 split.

To celebrate, Grimes presented Elon with his next Grammy potential hit single, Don't Doubt my Vibe.
https://m.soundcloud.com/user-209448905/dont-doubt-ur-vibe

With this release, he also dropped the cyber truck, with Grimes presenting it on stage as his cyber girl.

The rest of the story is mostly history, but Grimes also gave birth to Elons favorite son, named X AE A-XII.

So with that, a big Thank You to Grimes from everyone at WSB.  We know it wouldn't have been possible without you, because Elons ex wives never made him happy the way you do.

We cheer for your successes as a couple in 2021, and look forward to these TSLA 600c 12/31s maturing.  What we lack in talent, we make up in risk appetite. We stand with you Grimes and Elon!

"Mission Critical defense contractor." Palantir is an effective tool for the military, government, and corporations that are spying on us, and I for one want that government cabal money.

That being said a short lived Palantir pullback is eventually coming. If you're like me and planning to buy if it hits your target price, you should be selling puts.

For those of you who don't actually know what you're doing, selling a put option is essentially agreeing to purchase 100 shares of a stock at a specific price. So when your contract is up you either keep the full premium or you have to pay X amount for 100 shares.

The question becomes what price is a good price? I don't fucking know, I'm retarded. But I'll drop a few thousand if it gets to 18 again that's for sure. With that being said I'm **selling** 12/18 p at 20.50 and 18 strike prices for a premium right now of $1.90 and $1.00. 

For those who don't like math that is a cost basis of 18.60 and 17.00 per share. Typically I try to avoid contracts that will be exercised but with my long term stance on Palantir i am totally fine taking a more aggressive approach.

Figure out what you are comfortable paying and factor in the adjusted price point, don't trust my math just because you read it on the internet.

I bought the pack and, in that moment, I had an epiphany. I realized maybe I should be thankful for what I have and start enjoying the little things in life. And so as I suck off a micropenis, I am thankful to still have my health during this pandemic. I am thankful for my friends and family. I am thankful to be a Autistic Gay Bear with a gaped butthole.

Ive been a lifetime reefer smoker (27 yrs) I just started investing this year and as of today I'm up 227% mostly on the EV bubble..Now I love weed, but I wouldnt touch that shit in the market with your grandmother's dick. Buying weed from a dispensary was cool the first time I did it in Colorado when it was first legalized...once. (sure I'll buy a gram of weed at 2x the price because of tax) but after that I'm calling Jeff.

Jeff is my weed guy he drops my weed off and we smoke together (good guy) and with Jeff I don't have to go to a dispensary and wait in line to get charged too much for weed with a bunch of other mouth breathing stoner retards, while listening to shitty jam band music live from some STD infested music festival. 

Point is nobody going to buy smoke from a dispensary as long as it's so easy to grow your own or call Jeff. So I dont understand why people think this is going to be a good market to go into.

There's a market for edibles and soon you'll be able to buy them in the liquor isle in your stupid towns grocery store, I mean I'd go down to piggly wiggly for weed infused organic Cheerios twice a week if I could.

Now that we have several promising vaccine candidates, one cocktail drink and a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/sounds-strange-but-there-could-be-too-many-vaccines) saying we might have more vaccines than needed, I am of the opinion that we won't see another crash in Crude oil prices, rather they will slowly increase.

Furthermore, oil contango is fading, as per a [Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fears-of-a-covid-inspired-crude-oil-glut-fading-contango-tells-a-different-story-11606169583).

While oil prices have almost recovered the pre-crash levels, down -14% from pre-covid levels (I take the Feb-12 crude oil prices of 52$), the stocks still look hammered. BP is still down -40%, RDS down -30%, CVX down -15% and so on. Now these are the good companies that likely can survive multiple price crashes.

Reward is the highest where distress is the deepest. With that in mind, I purchased 2 OXY 12cc  12/04 @ 1.2 per contract. OXY is down -59% from Feb. 12 levels. As these $12 calls gave me tremendous returns, I sold them today. With the insane profits, I have decided to roll OXY contracts further, purchasing 4 OXY 18cc 12/18 contracts @.92 per contract. I do not intend to add further more on this position.

My reason for writing this is to observe opinions and ideas of fellow WSB retards who have been playing oil. Have you bought calls? Have you bought puts? Why?

Cheers.

Most of this growth was seen in less than a week. 

Now that we are nearing their live showing of their product this weekend, I am expecting to see that same growth we saw back in September, and this presents a load of new opportunities, especially if it went up so fast back then. 

NNOX is the Tesla of X-rays. Was very high risk high reward, and still may be, but if you trust the NNOX team it’s not at all. If all goes well this weekend, the SP will go higher than the price we see now which is rising in anticipation for this weekend.

Hint: Goldman Sacks just raised its target price to $20._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This week's insane EV run up was led by TSLA, but now they are being left behind ): The meme stocks are no longer pumping along with the big boy and people are starting to take profits and short. Loss of bullish sentiment and people starting to jump ship.

  
TSLA was the reason for all this EV hype this week and they ran up along with TSLA, but now they are overvalued (or have always been, but we just keep pumping on euphoria and FOMO) and the boomers and other people are aware.

  
The top might be here. TSLA up no longer mean meme stock up.

These Chinese EV auto manufacturers don't even produce 10% of TSLA's production each and yet their market cap's are around 10% of TSLA's or more. Everyone also accepts that the Chinese probably cook their books (Make stuff up because they don't allow Americans to audit.)  
Furthermore, when you own these Chinese stocks, they are actually technically worthless because you don't own a share of the actual company - They are VIEs which basically mean that they are shell companies and you don't actually own a share of the real company or have any rights or ownership.

Electric fuel cells are great and all, but they don't compare to hydrogen fuel cells. These hydrogen fuel cells have become safer than your granny's stairs, and given a few years, hydrogen will be the way to go, over electric, any day of the week.

Planes run off Kerosene, Ships off Engine Oil, and as oil prices continue to rise, they're gonna need more viable solutions, hydrogen fuel cells could be one of these.

Income and Cash flow has increased over the past 4 years.

Between 2014 and middle of 2016, it stayed at around $35 a share. It then jumped up to $55 a share towards the end of 2017. Since it has fallen to below $20 and is starting to make its climb back up. Seeing the current trend and it's current financial situation, I don't see how this stock doesn't go back up to at least $35 soon.

I bought 30 $30 Call options for UNM expiring 3/19/21 at .20. That's a stupid low price for a stock that should recover to at least $35. If it jumps back to it's $50+ highs, you're looking at easily making at least 10k - 20k per call.

$MGNI

Earnings Call:

Take a look at the recent earnings revenue year over year is up 62.01% beating by 7.4 million. EPS is up 2.5 times the estimate being expectations by 0.10 per share. Imagine how good you would feel if you ever hit 62.01% gain in your portfolio let alone in a year.

What do they do?

They sell ads. Specifically to streaming companies like Hulu, so while you're sitting there watching Rick and Morty wondering why you can't afford ad free Hulu $MGNI are the ones to thank for the ads you're watching.

Fundamentals:

Streaming platforms and access is expanding at a very fast rate. More houses are buying more streaming devices (phones, tablets, smart TVs). Their viewership grew 50% last quarter. Ad space is in high demand right now with the holidays as well as political ads that have and will run. Since Joe Biden won and coronavirus is over ad space is back in high demand with companies fiending for a spot on hulu and peacock. There's also like 15 different apes (money managers) "raising price targets" whatever that means. 

Stock is up 80% over the month and 54% over the week. The stock will hit $30 before. Options are cheap and going to rise. 

Edit:
u/mcf19 added how they're eliminating third party cookies, DIS and how their balance sheet is elite. Good info I wanted to add.
"I went in two weeks ago on MGNI 15c 12/18 ($0.10 then, now $2.50 plus). Their costs almost entirely fixed at this point and they have virtually no debt. 84% of their debt is "A/P - seller" which is money captured in transit between advertisers and the platforms they service. The other 10% of their debt is lease obligations and they have two small offices (gives a picture of how little debt they have). Super healthy company. With cookies going away on browsers and the new unified ID 2.0 initiative being implemented, this could blow up. Disney year end call on 12/10 will be huge for this, should give better (positive) details about the relationship between MGNI/DIS with the streaming platforms.

Goodluck trading my peeps! 🌈🐻 over and out!✌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bigger bets sub? Hey fellas, a lot of people keep complaining about the sudden influx of 4 and 3 figure net worth individuals in here bragging about $300 gains. These people aren’t going away, and to be honest, sometimes it’s funny having them around plus any posts like DD (when it’s real) and memes can get more eyeballs.

My question is, would people be interested in a sub WSBs where you had to confirm to the moderators you had at least 25k in your account in order to join? This could be any number, 50 even, but that’s the daytrade minimum so I went with that. I miss loss porn that has 5 zeroes in it and that’s the kind of content that would be available there, and I also have a feeling the DD wouldn’t just be glorified pump and dump or bubble feeding. It’d still be a bunch of autists but at least these ones are putting their money where their mouths are when not consuming large amounts of Wendy’s that their wife’s boyfriend had lying around the basement. Open to ideas for the name as well.

DPW Holdings Inc. is a fucking small company with 16.5M shares outstanding and just 8.88M afloat (with 21% short!!). The marketcap is just 100M, they have had revenue of just 27M in 2018 and 2019.

TLDR: 12/18 20c looking right_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Its open season. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gentlemen Start your Jet Engines (RR.L) **RR.L is on the move, more to the point it's taking off!**

If you don't want all your money on PLTR calls (though I do get why you would) consider Rolls Royce. Not the car company, the engine manufacturer. 

**The Good.**

The current share price has been depressed by a new issuance of shares and is still rock bottom after COVID-19. It has tumbled from \~700GBX ($9.10 USD aprox.) to \~120GBX as of now. The stock was hilariously oversold s boomers jumped ship, while its stock lost over 80% of its value its actual revenue dropped 23% (H1 2020).

It's not just a widebody jet engine manufacturer, it granted is still about 45% of overall revenue. It's defence arm actually grew their profit 19% YoY (H1 2020). Another key point is that most of its engines are already out in the wild and aftermarket sales and service is a significant generator of revenue over the service life of all their products. Therefore, it's not their new engines that are likely to be taken out of service if the airline industry struggles or even fails to fully recover.

As a further point to that rolls Royce is one of the few countries in the world with the skills and experience to design and build small scale nuclear reactors. Whether that's impotnat to you or not, Nuclear power may yet gain a place in the drive for cleaner energy.

It’s a household name, the company does have a lot of brand recognition and public goodwill and is still developing new products.

**The Bad**

*It is not optionable.*

The company is currently laden with debt, and overall, the company is in negative equity. To the tune of £3.3B (Full year 2019) this is most definitely NOT a potential value investment. They also do not have an efficient manufacturing process, estimating their current headcount to be 33% above what they expect they will need in the coming years. 

There is a high level of uncertainty in the commercial aviation market, at least with passenger aviation, and Rolls Royce have based many their forward-looking statements on a 90% recovery by 2022. If that is not the case the company could struggle, or even collapse.

The company has reduced the deficit on its pension find, closed to new employees since 2007, but it is still large, at £1.38B (FY 2019).

It’s nice to see you guys giving each other PS5s and shit, but we should also give back to charity, especially this year. Covid is taking all the attention, meaning other charities are probably getting less than what they normally get.

We should get some of our wins to Red Cross or any cause we feel related to. Donate to WWF, or in a few generations “bears” will only exist on the stock market. Hell, donate to Wikipedia for helping some of you get through college.

If the mods can organize a donation drive, I’d be happy to drop one hundred bucks.

\- Post must contain proof of position and requires poster to specify his charitable idea  
\- If the strike is hit, poster has to deliver or is banned from the sub (or he drinks piss or smth.)  
\- Maybe mods can come up with an idea to implement a rule or option where some money is given to charities such as autismspeaks and other charities, where sub participants profit directly.

This idea is just something that jumped in my head as i think we have become such a big sub that we could do a lot of good apart from gifting money spent on FD's to the retards at the big banks.

Also we would need a name for the Flair / Challange / Giveaway Style

If you dont mind i would also like to start off with a Promise.

Good night all! And see you fuckers tmrw!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSTH, throw some money you can burn on this one [Institutional ownership growing, what do they know that we don't?](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&subView=institutional)

Judging by Bill Ackman's statement to close a deal by the end of the year, there's something potentially in the card.

The structure of the SPAC is also shareholder friendly, so if it’s a good one, we will all make money.

What is definitely not in the cards: Airbnb, SpaceX, Wish etc.

What is likely on the cards: Stripe, Epic games, Bumble [etc.](https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/)

Most rumoured is Stripe. Which again, the Collison brothers have trolled about PSTH.

[Follow some of the rumours.](http://twitter.com/YoloCapitalMgmt)

[The OG post that got me interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jlwv11/psth_dd_on_my_24m_bet_11_downside_now_huge_upside/)

Ackman's following Stripe on twitter; Collison's doing Ackman.

PSTH seems to be in talks with them for some time.

Again, it is difficult to say, if it is Stripe or not.

What if it’s stripe?

If it’s Stripe, then you hit the jackpot.

Stripe could grow to a mamoth size(I am talking hundreds of billions of dollars) and there would be significant upside to it.

Stripe has been hiring people to go public, so that's something.

What’s the risk here?
Not much, considering that PSTH is not that overvalued. If it’s not Stripe, it would still not be a complete dud. As big investment firms have flocked to this one.

How to play?
Warrants, shares(my preference for now, after that you can sell CC) or leap calls(although the OI is not that high).

Personally, I would say, use some throw away money and see if it sticks.

DKNG- this stock has suffered immensely from covid, dropping to the high 30's from the mid 60’s. The story for draft kings hasn't changed. Huge growth potential with a total addressable market of more than 35B+. I believe Draft kings is better positioned than PENN due to their unique product, their digital presnce and their ability to scale into other markets quickly. DKNG has no debt and grew 40%+ even with most sports shut down. This could easily be a 75$+ stock. currently the consensus target is 61 with the high target of $ 100 and the low of $39.00.

1. Introduction

Some of you may recognize the name Fisker from Henrik Fisker’s first attempt at a self-branded vehicle, the Fisker Karma. It was supposed to be a competitor to Tesla but in an attempt to keep up they cut corners and were plagued with production and quality issues which eventually culminated in the company going bankrupt and being bought out.

Now you may be asking yourself why in the hell I’d start out by talking about the CEOs previous failure and that’s because I see that experience as an asset in his new venture, Fisker Inc.

&#x200B;

2. The Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean is Henrik’s newest creation, an all-electric SUV that will be made using recycled material in aim to be environmentally conscious as well as being as affordable as possible. This is a big shift from the Fisker Karma which was made to be a high-end, luxury sports car costing over $100,000 meaning the Ocean at $37,500 will have a much wider appeal and larger potential consumer base.

They also have a working prototype that did not need to be rolled down a hill. By the way, Nikola market cap is $11 Billion and Fisker is $4 billion.

&#x200B;

3. What’s different this time

Henrik has repeatedly reiterated the importance of securing a reliable supply chain, especially when it comes to the batteries, which has already been accomplished and according to this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0sMYhHUIP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0sMYhHUIP0) at around 5:30 he says Fisker has secured enough production capacity for 1 million vehicles for the first 5 years of production starting in the end of 2021. This is extremely important because the biggest downfall of the Fisker Karma was an unreliable and poor quality supply chain.

In this recent live event [https://kvgo.com/barclays/fisker-november-2020](https://kvgo.com/barclays/fisker-november-2020) (you can put whatever you want for name, email, company in order to view the recording) Henrik talks about the deal they’ve made with Magna International which is a Canadian automotive supply company with production capabilities all around the world (including China) which means an ability to expand outside of the US with ease. Utilizing Magna’s existing production capabilities also addresses one of the main issues they faced when producing the Fisker Karma as well as the fact that EV technology has improved tremendously in terms of reliability, availability and most importantly cost.

I figured lower PPS would bring greater volatility - Ride it up, and out. While watching the the price count up I dug deeper into it and I decided to swing, if not go long with this one. /lifestory 

Heres why:

- HIV vaccine and treatment - AIDS treatment - Hep C treatment  

- Covid-19 treatment in the works - easier to store and transport than others (temp range needs)

- Moving to Texas A&M Dec 1 (.gov money? .gov contracts?) 

- Mergers - Today (10 min before close) filings were released for ENZC to merge with ENCZ holdings. They are also planning to merge BioClonetics (a previously private company - who knows what the market thinks it's worth) into the holding company (finalization is expected very soon.)

That's a lot of positives and catalysts that will be happening pretty quickly. 

Top that off with the day: 

- 42.34% gain today

**TLDR:**

· Dec/Jan Leaps

· Long Shares until mid-late 2021

**What does this company do?**

Nanox is attempting to create a new age x-ray/CT machine at a significantly lower cost than previous machines (made by GE Healthcare/FujiFilm/Siemens/etc.). They do this by utilizing cold cathodes instead of regular cathodes to generate the electrons used to create X-rays. This allows for Nanox to cut out costs related to heat maintenance for X-rays. By lining multiples of these devices up in a ring Nanox saves on the cost of moving parts in legacy CT machines. Not having heated/moving parts also cuts down on the maintenance required to maintain the device throughout the years which may give hospitals additional savings. 

**Business Model**

Nanox is attempting to become a MSaaS company (Medical Scan at a Service). Targeting hospitals around the world. Currently planning on making $14 per scan. In addition they plan on additionally making money from annual contracts from maintenance. In contrast to this they plan on giving the devices to the hospitals for “free” (as long as they use the device a certain number of times a year). Since the cost of production for the device is estimated to be about $10,000 they should make the money back within 2-3 months of operation in the hospital.

**Catalysts**

Nanox doing its first live demonstration of the tech at the RSNA 2020 event. Happening Nov. 29 – Dec. 5 this year. Definitely going to have a runup for that and if it goes well the stock will pop. Second catalyst is mid 2021 if the machine passes FDA trials. Past that it depends on they’re growth and sales teams.

**Risks**

Biggest risk is if tech doesn’t work. Everything’s a sham and the stock goes to zero. Otherwise, FDA trials take longer than expected and gets delayed though if you’re holding shares you’ll be fine. Otherwise long term, hospitals don’t think this is a good deal and don’t upgrade their X-ray/CT scanners. 

**Analysis**

There’s almost no way that they don’t clear FDA trials though. Hear me out. The cold cathode fires electrons at a metal plate which generates the X-rays that hit the patient. In legacy a normal cathode is used (heated to some ungodly temp) hits some piece of metal to generate the X-ray which hits the patient. The X-ray being generated is no different since it’s just a “laser” at a certain wavelength. Therefore risks/damage to patient is no different from legacy systems for X-rays. For CTs in legacy systems this involves one X-ray being spun around the patient at high speeds to generate. For Nanox they’re using multiple X-ray lasers positioned in a ring around the patient so no moving parts. With software they should be able to control turning on/off certain lasers at a time so they should be able to mimic a legacy X-ray spinning around the patient should they need to so not all the lasers are firing at the same time limiting the risk of too much X-ray exposure. Since X-ray exposure is essentially the same and there’s less moving/heated parts there should be less danger to patients so 99% they pass FDA.

**My Investment strategy**

Buy shares/monthly leaps for the live demonstration RSNA 2020. There will probably be a small pullback as hype dies down after the event and before the FDA returns. Holding shares for FDA approval, no options because FDA is slow and hard to time. Selling most of holdings after FDA approval since then it depends on hospitals taking on the device and I have more faith in their tech than their business plan.

If the U.S. has the NBA and NFL, South Korea has esports. It's that popular.

The country's most popular video-game developer is **Gravity (Nasdaq: GRVY)**. And for a few reasons, its shares could jump as much as 10-fold in the coming years...

The company's revenues have grown an average of 91% a year over the past three years.

Now, the company is introducing four new online games this year...

One is Ragnarok Origin, which launched in South Korea in July. It immediately became the fourth-top-grossing game in both Google Play and Apple's App Store.

Another is Ragnarok X: Next Generation, which recently launched in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the rest of Southeast Asia.

That means business is going to dramatically pick up the pace, and then bulldoze right on to record levels in 2021, as these new games fully contribute to the bottom line.

**The Most Undervalued Gaming Stock**

The words "gaming stock" and "undervalued" rarely go together.

That's because most gaming stocks are either, 1) small, unprofitable newcomers hoping to score that one hit game that turns it into an overnight sensation... or 2) large, expensive enterprises like Tencent or Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

Gravity has been in the video-gaming business longer than both of these industry giants, though. And in that time, it has managed to build up a franchise potentially worth many times more than what investors are valuing the company at today.

The result is a company much cheaper than its competitors... and honestly, much cheaper than it ever should be, given its growth potential.

Gravity is cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis than any of the top four video-game companies.

The games already in the market are topping the charts in Google Play and the Apple App Store. And because this is a successful, long-running franchise, odds are heavily in its favor of sustaining that level of growth in the coming year.

Moreover, Gravity is doing this in the world's fastest-growing video-gaming market – Southeast Asia... where gaming is more than doubling the rate of growth in the rest of the world.

While global gaming revenues grew 5% in 2019, Southeast Asia witnessed a 16% jump. And Gravity is deeply entrenched in these emerging markets... the Next Chinas of the 21st century.

Right now, with a market cap of just $900 million, Gravity is an unpolished gem just waiting to be noticed by investors. It just hasn't yet had its time to shine.

Just as an example, NetEase – a major Chinese gaming company – is worth $65 billion alone today.

When you consider that NetEase started out as a sub-$500 million company when it first listed in the U.S., 10x is not only possible but likely.

Nike is going to the moon on the day of its earnings but it is likely to rally before then too (12/18/2020)

I am mainly looking at this from a consumer standpoint because I am a sneakers reseller who buys a lot from Nike and I have noticed a lot of shit lately that isn't really publicly available knowledge (I don't have any affiliation with Nike besides reselling their products so it's not technically insider info)

&#x200B;

Here's why:

Last quarter, Nike's EPS was projected $0.48 per share but reported $0.96 per share (surprise 97.92%) causing the stock to rally:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5nxqb119k3161.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9222414ec333a4b083c58f2fb6e0195a457cb779

&#x200B;

This quarter (3 months ending Nov 2020), Nike's EPS is projected to be $0.70 per share even though projected revenue this quarter is almost exactly the actual revenue last quarter. ($10.59B last quarter vs $10.55B  projected this quarter).

&#x200B;

\^ Point being that despite Nike shifting drastically to digital sales and digital sales making up a higher percentage of their revenue quarter after quarter, analysts are expecting their earnings to be considerably less on basically the same revenue which is bullshit because digital sales -> MUCH greater profit margins for them. 

&#x200B;

Now on to the insider-ish info that I have:

Nike's order #s begin with "C00" followed by a number. Since I make orders on Nike frequently, I have literally seen this number accelerate and this is what I have found: 

&#x200B;

Quarter length, Last order #  ,Fiscal Q , Difference since previous Quarter

Sep - Nov 2020 - C00309700000 (q2 2021) + 102200000

Jun - Aug 2020 - C00207500000 (q1 2021) +  29300000

Mar - May 2020 - C00178200000 (q4 2020) +  24500000

Dec - Feb 2020 - C00153700000 (q3 2020) +  16700000

Sep - Nov 2019 - C00137000000 (q2 2020) +  20400000

Jun - Aug 2019 - C00116500000 (q1 2020) +  17400000

So this is mostly speculative here and I'll get to more insider-ish shit after this but what I intend to show here is the difference between the last order number of each respective quarter from the previous quarter and there's an apparent increase of orders quarter after quarter with the most being in the Jun - Aug 2020 quarter when Nike CRUSHED expectations. This quarter, that difference has tripled and I strongly doubt that their online sales have gone up 200% in one quarter but it's just something to think about - the difference in their order numbers is really high. 

(I rounded the order #s' last digits)

&#x200B;

On to my next info:

For Nike US customers, Nike has 3 shipping options: Standard, Two-Day, and Next-Day shipping. In the quarter from march-may 2020 (when Nike's online sales went up 75%), Nike removed next-day shipping for a whole month because it could not keep up with the demand (two-day and standard shipping remained). In the quarter from June-August, Nike did not remove two-day or next-day even once because it was able to adapt to the demand and we saw how well they did. However, just this week, Nike removed Next-day shipping for 3 days and then removed both next-day and two-day shipping for 1 more day because they were getting so many orders. A lot of my shipments got delayed as well because they could not fulfill orders as fast as they were receiving them (although this has improved now):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jp61hgcag3161.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=173493f10a1991c1d9e8c1f048357904310c8b41

Yes, this is most likely because of the holiday season/black Friday approaching. But, judging from how well they kept up with demand last quarter even though it was a record quarter for them (digital sales wise), it's a good sign that they cannot keep up with the demand as efficiently this time since I think it means they are getting even more sales now.

Lastly, Nike has been shifting more and more to its digital business and about two weeks ago, they had a 5 day "Member's Day" sale that saw a bunch of old inventory restock on their site including shoes from 2018/2019. They are getting rid of a bunch of inventory of theirs which will boost their revenues/earnings and I doubt that this is reflected in analysts' estimates. Almost all of their new releases are being sold out within minutes and so many general releases on their site are selling out so much faster than general releases were ever before.

Conclusion: 

From the standpoint of a Nike reseller/consumer, I can say with confidence that Nike is poised to crush  earnings like they did last time once again. The demand is extremely high and not going anywhere, the shift to digital has made them much more profitable, and as per my experience, their inventory turnover rate is higher than ever and they're getting rid of a bunch of old shit.

Yes, I am an amateur investor, but I know Nike in and out and this is seeming to be a record quarter for them.

For Wednesday's earnings report, the consensus is calling for:

* $1.35 EPS for the quarter
   * This would be a decline from the same period last year of 17%
* Revenues in the agriculture segment of $5.35 billion
   * Decline of 7% from last year in this industry
* Revenues of $2.0 Billion in Construction & Forestry equipment
   * Decline of 31% from last year

Moreover, annual revenues in the ag equipment manufacturing industry have trended down at 4.6% on average since 2015.  Growth is expected to be flat for the next 5 years.  Additionally, steel costs have skyrocketed in 2020 and global supply chains are still all fucked up.

1. At any given time there are only a **few $25000 ultrasound machines in the hospital**, but there are hundreds of patients who either need IVs, nerve blocks, and scans etc **ASAP**. Healthcare is one part medicine but two parts customer service and the faster doctors can scan the patient the faster doctors can do other shit and everyone's happy. (🚀)
2. This device is truly the leader in its class when you consider portability, image quality and cost nothing comes even close to this at the price. Anytime someone whips this thing out in the hospital **everyone asks wtf is that ???.** Think back to when that one rich ass kid in the school had the newest iphone back in 2003 and everyone wanted to blow him. Yeah this has the same wow factor.  (🚀🚀)
3. **If ultrasound will diagnosis the patient then it is the first and/or preferred form of diagnosis period.** You would always rather ultrasound a patient before doing an x-ray or CT or MRI. Why? because it doesn't fucking expose the patient to unnecessary radiation.  (🚀🚀🚀)
4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST. This device is $2000 with a subscription, **subscription business model** with a relatively low cost of entry = **$$$** 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I am mentally retarded for going into medicine, but I know a revolutionary medical device when I see one or be that 🐻🌈 you were meant to be. Buy commons @ 15.50 and expect $20+ EOY

In summary, there is no such thing as the top, "buy low, sell high" is officially being replaced by "buy high, sell at the stratosphere."  Stocks go up.

TLDR: The moon is still far away, just less far away than yesterday.

**Introduction**

There has been [research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077) released in the last year showing abnormal returns from stocks being piled onto by retail investors. The data these academics used to write these research papers came from Robinhood's public API. Robinhood recently [shut down](https://fortune.com/2020/08/10/robinhood-popularity-data-robintrack-stock-market-trading-tracker/) the valuable “stock popularity” feature of their API (probably to sell to hedge funds in the future)

So where are you supposed to get data on what stocks are becoming meme stocks? You’re looking at the answer. Forget “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal”, this sub is the Bloomberg Terminal.

**Hypothesis**

Research has suggested retail investor interest as a source of alpha and the Robinhood API was used to tap into this alpha. Although access to the Robinhood API has been restricted, we can use data from WallStreetBets as a proxy. This may even be a more valuable data source, as it is likely less familiar to the 50+ year olds running institutional funds.

**Methodology**

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/i6mwfs/i_wrote_a_script_to_parse_over_a_million/g0wot40?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is how to access the data by hand and [here](https://quiver-quantitative.medium.com/tutorial-backtesting-an-alternative-data-trading-strategy-on-lean-e9e46c735678) is how to backtest strategies using it.

I used a relatively simple strategy that simply bought Tesla stock on days when WallStreetBets was talking about the stock more than normal, and sold on days when it was being mentioned less.

**Results**

I backtested the strategy from 1/1/19 to 6/1/20 and made a total of 175 trades over that time period. The strategy received a Sharpe Ratio of 1.78.

**Conclusion**

While my naive strategy performed quite well, I'd like to test out some more strategies over the coming weeks and start trading on the data to really put its utility to the test. I'll plan on keeping you all updated on my performance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My pipi is like a rock rn _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GES taking off ahead of earnings 🤔 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I see gaybears posting bad omens about our beautiful new green market, so listen up retards, here are five good reasons why there is absolutely no crash coming. 1) Vaccine news has been steadily pouring in and it’s been GOOD. At first people were afraid that Pfizer wasn’t going to be enough, and concerned about the logistical problems that came with a -80 degree maintenance temp. These were sound worries but now we have Moderna, AND AstraZeneca with successful safe trials, and their storage is far easier, making logistics of distribution a breeze. Expect tens of millions of doses to frontline health workers and the most vulnerable population to start going out by early January, maybe earlier than that if Trump doesn’t fuck around.

2) Yes covid lockdowns are happening and will continue to happen. Unemployment covid stimulus benefits are scheduled to run out the day after Christmas in America, leaving at least 20 million Americans completely fucked as lockdowns continue. Do you really think Congress will fail to come together to pass another stimulus bill?? The stimulus is coming, and it will give our beautiful new green market the legs it needs to continue running until the vaccine is widespread.

3) President-elect Buyden’s victory is sealed. Trump’s legal team is collapsing from the inside out, Republican-elected judges are throwing out his lawsuits left and right and calling them frivolous and meritless. The recounts are being recounted for the second and third times and they’re still for Buyden, all respectable sources have found no signs of significant election fraud. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s over, and the stock market is further shifting toward green energy to account for the change in policy.

4) Will there be corrections here and there on overpriced EV stocks? Sure, but then you BUY THE DIP, gay-ass bears. Our new green economy is here to stay and we’re making millions. The millenials have won, boomers get fucked.

1. GME dips after earnings, Cohen tender offer. Mega squeeze.  
2. GME Spikes big after earnings, which will only rly Happen if Cohen is mentioned in the plan for the future and has found a place in GME, squeeze begins, however not as violent, still awesome though.  
3. Cohen tender offer BEFORE earnings. This would happen if Cohen believes earnings will be good and doesn’t want to offer after a spike in price.  

Now the most probable scenario imo is Cohen buying right after earnings. Pfizer vaccine will likely be approved a few days after earnings, Cohen would not want to wait after this to buy and end up having to offer at a higher price. Also, with Christmas sales coming, he won’t want to risk a run up of GME before he buys.  

Technicals are strong af and IWM is ripping.  

Just buy GME.   

Positions: calls and shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box I asked you guys what company you wanted me to do a valuation on and PLTR was the favorite. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.

&#x200B;

* Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients
* PLTR has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government, particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military
* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients
* With  \~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future  opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a  binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook, and  as a result, valuation, significantly

**Company Background and Summary:** Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**  controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a  partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,  existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a  one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which  will be key in its growth as a company.

PLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.

**Gotham:** Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute responses.

**Foundry:** This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily targeted to commercial customers.

Despite having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC) has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019. The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR  platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,  integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,  enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \~AI\~ among others.

The revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year 2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this  revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**  – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131  at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and  operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual  for a company in high growth mode.

**Palantir’s Business Model:** PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long, with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running. Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.

&#x200B;

[Source: Company Q3 presentation](https://preview.redd.it/ircmb18ts2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=323cabade8b9de9f729a53bfa1fd12db81813be2)

Acquire – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in  revenue in a calendar year. 

Expand – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having negative contribution margin throughout the same period. 

Scale – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy. Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.

**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:** Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and government sectors. 

Company management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9zd99daws2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b543896f77f55f1cc3e3c82be6f3beca58dbbcbc)

For government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market. 

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/dxbndfxys2161.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bce1a47f32cda8adb9a74854f7c9b32dadf98af1)

Sell-side estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down  methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to  Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM  levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.

**Government services:** Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In 1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme for future  cross-selling opportunities.

Government contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent potential upside to our estimates.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9i0a4a1t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07f9fb6ee9224b06f32347b8c5545038ef3896e

**Commercial services:** In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.

With ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity, but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater  than 20% of total commercial revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h8jlnnc3t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3275a383450ac8822c322fe5d00da3369b94ddfe

While the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a few contracts per quarter and year. 

https://preview.redd.it/5h7ycrw4t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35cf55a824c910ae8ffb748559926c05697d09ff

**Quarterly Earnings recap:** Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019. Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter. 

The company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market  fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these  solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers  in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a  not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a  customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be  crucial in diversifying the customer base.

Adjusted operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force and account management teams.

 For core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake). Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV / Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the total of both trading multiples.

However, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.

 These two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue  visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does  the stock deserve its premium?

**Valuation:** We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in 2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.

We lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:

* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025
* Avg.  Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.  From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e
* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter
* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter
* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex
* Free  Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth  software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS  multiples

 For purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from  customers has a very large effect on the calculation.

 Then, depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on  different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range  of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \~$3 to the stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin similarly adds  \~$3.

**Key Risks:** Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.** 

Customer concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.

Competition is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools from other software companies outside of PLTR.

Recent and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in  significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20  and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing  this decline.

Palantir is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical  quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more  information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of  the business appropriately. 

**Key catalysts:**

Increased commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In  addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability  than we have currently modeled.

The company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.

**TLDR;** Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play. Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.
