Thinking about throwing another 2k into something (ICLN?)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are ETF prices purely based on underlying holdings? For example, say that Elon Musk starts an ETF. He has a cult following. He holds 10 shares of something in his fund, each are $30 ($300 total). This thing has millions of shares out there so the 10 from Elon don't really make it move. Also, just for arguments sake, say that the "something" is completely hidden, only the price is shared. This is so that people can't follow Elon and make the stock move.

He issues 100 shares of his ETF. 

Will the ETF sell for exactly $3? Or is there some premium on that price because everyone wants to follow Elon?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on ACST (Penny stock) - Seems to be on sale at .57 ACST its a penny stock.

Hi, i am not really a guy good with technical analysis, so i am kind of asking for a favor. I read news and do my own thinking in that regard, but if anyone could give me the technical aspect that would be great. REC Silicon produces silicon for the solar cell industry. REC Silicon has silicon production in Moses Lake in the state of Washington and in Butte in Montana, USA. With 2,300 employees globally, REC had a turnover of more than NOK 7 billion in 2012. Solar panel production in Singapore, which from 2013 is part of REC Solar, is also included in these figures. It is now priced at 2.05USD, many brokerages believe this should be over 2.7USD, and with many contracts and projects ahead, this is a stock that is worth looking at. “We welcome Violet Power to Washington and look forward to a close collaboration in building the comprehensive silicon-based supply chain for high technology solutions in the United States. The U.S. represents one of the largest and fastest growing solar installation markets in the world, creating huge opportunity for high tech domestic manufacturing. We applaud Violet Power for its leadership in entering the market at this critical time. Our collaboration will create hundreds of direct jobs and multiply the indirect jobs linked with solar, battery storage, and semi-conductor applications” said Tore Torvund, CEO and President of REC Silicon. REC Silicon has already invested over $1.7Billion in Washington, in a unique plant employing its proprietary silane gas-based fluidized bed reactor for granular polysilicon. Violet Power is building a state-of-the-art facility, co-located with REC’s existing Moses Lake plant to manufacture solar cells and modules, adding ingot and wafer production in time. Violet Power’s initial cell production will begin sampling in the second quarter of 2021 with 500 MW of solar cells, reaching 1GW of capacity by 2022 and scaling to 5GW over the next five years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Free/Low-Cost Options Data API Providers Hi:

Anyone have an idea how long it will rise before the pull back ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter Following my comment on this sub 3 days ago, many of you have been asking me to share the stock picks from this program I have built that scrapes Reddit and Twitter for emerging stocks. So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can't publish them here. However, I still wanted to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**Before I share the picks of this week with you below, please consider reading this crucial preamble. That should answer your questions and avoid misconceptions.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed meme stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.
* I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: For those who are worried that this will only surface PnD penny stocks, I have taught my program how to flag picks that are highly correlated with terms associated with PnD schemes (“moon”, “pump”, “dump” etc.). I still have to add a level of human curation to the algorithmic results, doing my own DD on the stocks I highlight, but my goal is to have the program do all the work in the future so there isn’t any biases coming in.

**2nd Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

I feel like I have something to look forward to amidst all the doom and gloom of the world. Hey all. Just wanted to say thanks. I tend to be a bit of a pessimist, and a hung out on r/collapse a bit too much. The past couple of years, and especially the past month have not been great for my mental health- it was all doom and gloom. 

I work a steady job, own a home, own my car outright, etc. and I felt like I was making all the 'smart' financial moves- but i never felt like my actual worth was going up-  everything just felt steady. 

This year I decided to start investing, partly since things were still relatively low due to last year, and partly because I felt confident about the new administrations stimulus, GND prospect, and infrastructure bills. I'm not investing much, just what I can afford to lose, but I finally feel like I have something to look forward to- something that can actually grow.

What can I do?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Loss on ARCT last week, but the rest remain winners. Tickers on the watchlist this week: JMIA, CRSR, PLTR, COTY, FEYE, SFIX **What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

For those of you following me from my ARCT position, what a week it had last week! Unfortunately the covered calls I sold canceled out most of the gains. Having said that, my position went from -500% to now only -20% for this ticker. Unreal.

I started trimming some of my other positions last week as they were hitting my profit target of 60-80%. Here are the tickers I have positions on: BIG, CRSR, FROG, FSLY, GME, OSTK, PLTR, SPCE. At this time the only one that will maybe get assigned is OSTK, but I will most likely end up closing it for a profit before it gets to that point. Most of my positions expire this week which means they will be highly volatile with price movement. It also means that as long as they stay AT-THE-MONEY or higher I will be receiving a good amount due to theta & delta. I'm not a gambling man so at this point I will sell once they hit around 50% profit. Most of these positions are at 40% profit so if Monday is green I will definitely sell. It's expiration week so these can swing very quickly in either direction. 

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my "watchlist". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**JMIA - Jumia**

[jmia chart](https://imgur.com/zhUJCGv)

JMIA took off in November and since then has been in steady uptrend following the channel. It had a dip recently where it found some buyers at the $32-35 level. Currently price at $37 I think a good spot to sell some puts here looking for break-even share price of $30. Keep in mind only the monthlies are available for this ticker so we will need to sell 5-6 weeks out. That's ok because it will still give us a kick in premium.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 19, 2021 $34 strike puts sold to open for $3.80 or $380 premium. Return: 11%.

Break-even share price: $30.20.

&#x200B;

**CRSR - Corsair**

[crsr chart](https://imgur.com/QpLWHyA)

CRSR was on my list last week and IMO while it's still under $38-40 range it is still a good time to sell the $35 strike put. It's currently trading at the support/resistance line. If it breaks below, maybe it will re-visit the bottom trend line around $35/36. This is where I will sell my puts. Selling the $35 strike put will give us a break-even price at roughly $31.50. This means even if the share price drops another 20% from this level we will still remain profitable.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 19, 2021 $35 strike puts sold to open for $3.40 or $340. Return: 10%.

Break-even share price: $31.60

&#x200B;

**PLTR - Palantir**

[pltr chart](https://imgur.com/Z5TFn1w)

I've been selling puts on PLTR since the start of December and haven't been assigned once. It's been in the $23-28 range for about 6 weeks now and IV is still high. Share lock-up expiration is nearing. I believe the lock-up ends 3 days after they report earnings in early February. I'm going to sell Feb puts here anticipating a run-up into earnings and possibly selling just before depending on the share price. 

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 12, 2021 $24 strike puts sold to open for $2.30 or $230 premium. Return: 10%.

Break-even share price: $21.70. << We are profitable as long as the stock stays above this price.

&#x200B;

**COTY - Coty Inc**

[coty chart](https://imgur.com/MJSijK3)

Another new addition to the weekly watchlist. Similar to PLTR, COTY has been consolidating for 6 weeks now. Look at the coiling. IMO this could be ready for another small pop. Looking at some of the options it is not the most liquid of stocks. My preference in this case would be to purchase 100 shares and sell the $7.50 covered call 3 weeks out. The return on the covered call is about 3.7%. I'll be looking to collect the return on my shares as well as 3.7% from the CC. Keep in mind selling the CC 3 weeks out means you will most likely need to hold this position at least 2 weeks. In the case that the stock price takes off your CC will have an increase of \*extrinsic\* value meaning that even though your share price is rising, the covered call is off-setting those gains until we get a little closer to expiration and the extrinsic value goes down.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Purchase 100 shares. Sell Jan 29, 2019 $7.5 strike covered call for $0.25 or $25 premium. At this moment you are collecting $25 on the CC per $680 spent on shares which makes the return on just the covered calls about 3.7%.

&#x200B;

**FEYE - FireEye**

[feye chart](https://imgur.com/VHKg6A1)

FEYE has had some great momentum at the end of 2021. After such a huge spike drawing lines is kind of pointless. IMO some profit-taking occurred after those big rips and the stock is beginning to settle. I'm willing to take a chance selling the $21.5 strike puts here.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. 5 Feb, 2021 $21.5 strike puts sold to open for $1.25 or $125. Return: 6%.

Break-even share price: $20.25. A 10% drop from this level will still have us coming out profitable.

&#x200B;

**SFIX - StitchFix**

[sfix chart](https://imgur.com/PN59KW2)

SFIX stock price coming back down to reality after the share price more than doubled on last quarter's earnings report. It bounced off the $55 level a few days ago and is retesting it now. Short interest on this ticker is still pretty (\~40%) so maybe we'll see some covering before we get into next earnings. Selling $54 puts at this level can give us a cost basis of around $51 should we get assigned.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. 5 Feb, 2021 $54 strike puts sold to open for $3.10 or $310. Return: 6%.

Break-even share price: $50.90 << the stock price needs to drop about 8% from these by expiration for us to be assigned. I'll be comfortable selling a couple of these ones._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bloomberg: SoftBank Takes Stake in DNA Firm Pacific Biosciences SoftBank Group Corp. has taken a stake of about 6% in [Pacific Biosciences of California Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PACB:US), a U.S. DNA-sequencing company whose stock has risen sevenfold in the last year, according to a person with knowledge of the investment.

The stake, currently worth more than $350 million, highlights the fast-expanding portfolio of public equity investments by SoftBank’s asset management unit SB Northstar, said the person, who asked not to be named as its investment decisions are private. SoftBank has spent about $20 billion on stocks and derivatives through the unit, in which Masayoshi Son, its billionaire founder, personally holds one-third of the stake.

&#x200B;

$ADC - Beautiful triangle and channel here. Higher lows as well which I love. Easy 5% play here at least. RSI is fair, but Stoch is low and Vortex is almost crossing.

&#x200B;

$AEP - Beautiful area of value here. 77$ is the best possible buy in though. All indicators say there will be a reversal soon.

&#x200B;

$BYND - Great channel play here, and a great value. Indicators say a reversal is coming but possibly a day or two out still.

&#x200B;

$COR - Great channel play, just showed some confirmation and now having first pullback. All indicators mean they have plenty of room to run still.

&#x200B;

$EBR - Beautiful ascending triangle here. In channel of value and RSI is fair. Stoch indicates pullback coming, and Vortex is very low.

&#x200B;

$ED - Great value, almost can't get better. Easy 10% for a full move here. Indicators show it should reverse and then small pullback.

&#x200B;

$FGEN - Great area of value as well. Small pullback but should go up from here. Indicators are fair at best, but price action is beautiful.

&#x200B;

$MDC - Great uptrend as well here. Small pullback with plenty of room to run here. At support as well. Indicators show reversal is coming.

&#x200B;

$MUX - Great small channel here, and up trending. Plenty of room to run up as well. Stoch and Vortex looks like a great reversal coming.

&#x200B;

$PTGX - Just hit channel and now up trending. May have a small pullback, then take off again. This is a great area of value and indicators are fair right now.

&#x200B;

$WDAY - Great channel up here, and just broke 200EMA. Indicators are fair but it is technically up trending so that makes sense._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Interested in Short Interest? Short interest may be a strong indicator regarding the price of a stock/market. Have a read!

SRPT (Sarepta Therapeutics) is a drug delivery company that's also in Cathy's beloved ARKG portfolio.It was absolutely gutted on Friday (dropped 50%) after their study on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy turned out to be a flop.

On a quick side note, the humanist in me is hurt by this, because Muscular Dystrophy is a horrid disease; I've interacted with many Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy children that were immobile by the age of 10 and this could have been a big breakthrough.

But the money grubber in me makes my mouth water. I think this 50% drop is an overreaction. While this is a big setback, SRPT  also offers other products, and we're now testing long term support levels. To confirm this bias, ARKG bought 845k more shares of SRPT after the drop. While this is bullish indeed, we also have to keep in mind she's also doing this to average down her previous buys that were at significantly higher levels.

So any thoughts on buying this dip next week? Was this indeed a huge overreaction and does anyone think we'll get back to $100+ levels quite quickly (i.e. week or two)?

• 5 million were habitual buyers (6+ purchases)

I know there has been a lot of high profile IPOs that have not done well in the last couple of months, but this seems to be one of the worst values.

On the flip side, I can't help but wonder if this is an opportunity to buy the stock cheap? Problem is, everything I've learned about analyzing stocks up to this point requires there be more than a few weeks of data to poke through, I don't even know where to start with this one.

1. When does expiration happen? Is it market open/close? I found this but not sure it's accurate since it seems weird to not be able to buy/sell shares on the expiration date AND you won't know the market price at the time you execute: "According to NASDAQ, options technically expire at 11:59 AM Eastern Standard time on the date of expiration...Public holders of options contracts, however, must indicate their desire to trade no later than 5:30 PM on the business day preceding the option expiration date."

2. Can you execute the option to allocate at any point prior to the expiration date?

3. If you own a contract, how do you declare you want to execute the option to buy/sell? I use TDAmeritrade and wasn't sure where I'd go to find that in their platforms.

4. Do brokerages like TDAmeritrade automatically execute (or not) on expiration based on your cash-like resources (i.e. ability to buy the shares) and whether the contracts are in the money or not?

Questions about profit/loss calculations:

5. Let's assume I buy 1000 standard call contracts at $4.8 premium and $57 strike price. Stock price is $59 at expiration. Based on Profit = contracts * shares per contract * (stock market price - strike price) - premium * contracts, Am I correct that I would ultimately pay $4,800 to receive 1000*100*(59 - 57) = $200,000, assuming I execute the option and immediately sell at market price?

6. Suppose now that we're in the above scenario where I own 1000 calls and the stock price has jumped $2 and it's about to be the expiration date. At that point, shouldn't the value of my contracts be around $200,000 - with the "around" reflecting liquidity premia and risk of potential expiration day price fluctuations? In other words, don't the contract prices converge toward expected profit? This is confusing to me because it seems like the contract prices change that much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forgive me the "gambling" post - what is your pick for the next months? Hi everyone!

I do realize this is a very "unconventional - not recommended" question, but I'm willing to take a bet with some money I could set aside for 2-3 months. The idea would be to put it all in one stock, wait a few weeks/months, and get out once it hits a reasonable gain (+15% e.g.). I do realize this is a huge risk, and I could lose it all, but willing to take the bet...

See link: https://orsted.com/en/media/newsroom/news/2021/01/837698488913840

In short, the OYSTER project partners share a vision of hydrogen being produced from offshore wind at a cost that is competitive with natural gas (with a realistic carbon tax), thus unlocking bulk markets for green hydrogen making a meaningful impact on CO2 emissions, and facilitating the transition to a fully renewable energy system in Europe. The project is planned to start in 2021 and run to the end of 2024. ITM Power is responsible for the development of the electrolyser system and the electrolyser trials, while Ørsted will lead the offshore deployment analysis, the feasibility study of future physical offshore electrolyser deployments, and support ITM Power in the design of the electrolyser system for marinisation and testing. 

Why this is crucial??
It is currently impossible at current to decarbanise the entire electricity grid, due to inertia and the inherent nature of intermittent renewable energy sources. There is also the very important factor that most people seem to miss which is that all the distribution systems are not rated for a huge penetration in EVs. Essentially the cables in the ground are very old and are rated for 'normal' use. If we suddenly add millions of charging points across the grid, the cables will breach their thermal limits. Thus, in order to increase our transition to being more renewable we need 1) more offshore wind that can be transported back to shore 2) the efficiency of batteries to increase 3) we need offshore hydrogen. This project is a key first step on the path to developing a commercial offshore hydrogen production - something we need in order to electricity the whole electricity grid. 

A lot of this will already be priced in to Orsted and ITM but it seems both could be good long term investments as they are leading the way. I've also not seen any posts on ITM yet and wanted to give them some exposure.

I'm opening a roth ira and was looking for advice on which etfs to invest in as well as how I should weight them. I've been thinking about some combination of VOO, ARKX etfs, and ICLN, but was hoping to gain some more insight from y'all.

I purchased FBGRX (35%) FCPGX (25%) FEMKX(15%) and FWWFX (15%) mutual funds.

Was this the right move? Or should I have done it differently.

I maxed out my 2020 contribution I always had a simple IRA I turned 30 and decided I wanted a roth ira as well.

I have 3000 dollars I just put in a brockage account as well. Should I invest this in stocks or move it over to my Roth IRA and put it in that now or just continue putting money in each pay check til it's at 6000?

Thank you for your help._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nordstrom Stock Possibly Returning to 52 Week High  Nordstrom stock has been rallying, gaining 167% since bottoming at $11.79 on Sept. 29, reflecting optimism that its sales will rebound as Covid-19 vaccines take hold. The near term, however, is still ugly for the company. While overall holiday spending appears to have climbed, it’s hard to gauge just yet how well Nordstrom’s business performed, given the most recent Covid surge and restrictions. Early signs point to slower online growth than peers’, though off a larger base. 

Nordstrom has far fewer traditional stores than its competitors, which has permanently cut costs by $300 million or so during the pandemic, and should benefit from pent-up demand from wealthier shoppers. 

The company also has been getting more efficient as it closes more stores—and analysts estimate that the total count will fall from 380 to 308 next year. Nordstrom’s net sales per square foot have been climbing steadily in recent years, to $509 in 2019, up from $492 the year before and less than $400 in 2012. 

 If sales continue to recover, I believe Nordstrom stock should be able to return to its February high of $43.

Bull market 2021?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $WISH, The Ultimate Stimulus Play This post is not financial advice and I am not an expert. Please do your own due diligence. 

I made a post on Tuesday morning about $WISH, and since then, the share price rose from about $18.80 to $21.58 (up nearly 15%), and then dipped back down to $20.36 on Friday. The post where I explain why I believe Wish.com is undervalued can be viewed here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

There are a few highly influential events that I believe will happen soon, and I’m gonna try to explain why I think Wish.com is the perfect play to navigate the next few months and beyond. 

1. With the house, senate, and presidency going democrat, I believe that additional stimulus, if not passed very soon, will be in the news non-stop. Even if it doesn’t pass right away, this simply means there is more time to play the hype. 
2. I believe that data will come out showing that not enough people are being vaccinated and/or too many people will refuse to become vaccinated. This can create uncertainty about extended stay-at-home orders and/or delays in getting back to a normal way of life.
3. I believe there will be uncertainty around increases in taxes for big companies. 

In reference to point 3, I believe Wish’s share price is so undervalued that it can weather any overall market volatility caused by news of attempts to increase corporate taxes. As an e-commerce company, it is a no-brainer that wish.com will benefit from additional stimulus and extended lockdowns. 

On top of this, WISH is yet to release their first earnings report post-IPO, and the quiet period before analysts start setting price targets will be over in about 2 weeks. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Bank of America did the underwriting for Wish. The share price is currently down 15% from the IPO price of $24. I would assume that those three companies would set higher price targets for Wish to justify the IPO price that they did the underwriting for.
