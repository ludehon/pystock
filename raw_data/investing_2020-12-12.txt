Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Corsair Gaming (CRSR) - Due Diligence (DD) - Semi-Long Post. Hi, all. First time poster in r/investing.Wanted to post here to share my thoughts and share what I collected about Corsair. I feel it's a great company to have moving in the future.

Corsair Gaming (DD)

Corsair is a very reputable company that has existed since 1994. CRSR are the leaders in making extreme high quality PC Components (RAM, Coolers, Power Supplies, Keyboard, Mouse, PC Cases, Gaming Headsets) and now venturing into Esports as a leading company. If you have built your own custom PC you probably have a corsair part in there. Extremely reputable company in the gaming world and known to be high quality and very durable parts with mostly high ratings.

Corsair started its IPO at $17.25 per share in September 2020 having lasted 3 months.  Since then it's current at $33.50 up 90% since inception. It's high point is 51.26 and now experiencing a pullback. where it's now valued at $33.50.

Let's take a look at Q3 Results. Let's compare it to its established competitor: Logitech trading at approximately $85

Corsair (Year to Year Growth)[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4387552-corsair-gaming-inc-2020-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4387552-corsair-gaming-inc-2020-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation)

Net Revenue:  +60.7%    
Gross Profit:  +112.4%    
Operating Income: +353.6%    
Net Income: +2293.5% !!!!    
Adjust Net Income: +384%    
Cash Flow: 24.7million in 2020 vs 2.1million in 2019.  

Logitech:    
Net Revenue: +73%    
Gross Profit: +108%    
Operating Income: +18%    
Net Income: +276%  

Implications? Corsair is AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING. Look at that operating income increase. They're meeting their expectations with their aggressive expansion  Corsair is growing faster than Logitech in terms of raw numbers. Cash flows shows what a great health state it is in moving forward and how they pose as a serious competitor to LOGI (Logitech) moving forward. Seems like a good mid/small cap growth stock.

We could go more into the numbers if you'd like using its PPT but the numbers look solid all across.

Institutional Ownership:Corsair is 91% owned by institutions  

[https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr](https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr)  

Owned by JPMorgan, Blackrock, Citadel Goldman Sachs etc.

It's a company that institutions believe in as they hold 91% of the shares!! The worrisomee is that comes with this is that there it's usually missing the volume as opposed to recently popular debuts like Palantir and Airbnb. A lot of  long term investors are locked in (myself included) and there's little  volume movement (1.5m on average), price is a bit volatile.

The Catalysts:

This black friday/Cyber Monday was different due to Covid. there was an increase in gaming supplies as countries are forced to lockdown and people have nothing to do. It's reported that most of popular Corsair products that went on Sale were sold out BF/CM and Corsair completely ran out of stock. $$$.[https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/10cfa2da-de15-40d3-aa82-31c9c7145e80](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/10cfa2da-de15-40d3-aa82-31c9c7145e80)

An excerpt: CEO Paul, “We believe Corsair is at the center of this growing trend with our wide range of gaming and streaming products. This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves. We are ramping up our supply chain and manufacturing partners as fast as possible, and we expect to thoughtfully be growing our channel inventory during the next few months, as well as supporting the continued high demand from our end customers. We recently released our new flagship gaming keyboard, the K100, which at $229 is the best keyboard we have built. We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, which were sold out within the first few days of launch. We continue to launch exciting new high performance products at a fast clip, with approximately one new product per week.”

Prior to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday: They were revising their 2020 outlook because they exceeded it by expecting Net Revenue from 1.616m to 1.631m and Adjusted EBITDA from 187m to 193m.With how they even did even better on BF/CM sales than they anticipated, expect higher results.

This Christmas is no different. Cyberpunk 2077 and lockdown still in place in US/Canada and other countries, people going to spending money on Corsair products yet again. This is in part with increased streamers in Youtube/Twitch that corsair is heavily investing in in terms of investing in a program for people to enroll to learn how to effectively stream and we can expect great things for the company in the future.

February 9 is the expected Q4 earnings. 

Corsair is in a good position to easily beat out ER. As they already smashed their ER in Q3 by 0.26!!

Analysts Predictions:After Q3 Earnings the newest price target for analyst    
Credit Suisse Group: $31    
Barclays: $45    
Robert W. Baird: $41    
Cowen: $37    
At least 7 Buy Ratings, None at Sell.

For this website:   
[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crsr/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crsr/forecast)   
9 has a average price target of $38, with the tops being at $49.

Analysts would say Corsair is slightly undervalued at the moment.

**TL;DR Corsair Gaming is a company in a great position for both the short term, and long term and one of the ideal growth stocks moving forward. It's worth taking a good hard look and a stock that will likely more than pay off in \~2months + easily barring sudden bad news.**

Edit: I'd be happy to answer any questions you guys have and critical questions also help me to see if I did my job right, so keep on coming :D!

I want to discuss how they are being priced into the green stocks.

How is our current market pricing green energy stocks? Are they:

* Already priced in the idea that Biden will get **a lot** of what he wants from his version of the Green New Deal (he is pushing for a framework that will transform US to a zero-emission economy by 2050). 

* Already priced in **some** of what Biden wants. So maybe instead of 500,000 new charging stations, they expect maybe 200,000?

* Not pricing in any of Biden's promises. The growth is based purely on the new green regulations coming from states and and other foreign countries. 

Representative stocks are plays like Chargepoint, Tesla, Plug, Sunrun, solaredge, etc. I personally think it is problematic if the green stocks are soaring due to expectations of the new administration doing a lot for green energy. There are a lot of purple seats out there and the Ds don't have a clear majority._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bearish on Paysafe $BFT??

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Categorizing the cloud market I am trying to classify the cloud market for DD and comparison. I am only interested in publicly traded companies in US. So far I have managed the following 

1. Content delivery network and Edge cloud - FSLY, NET, AKAM, RXT
2. Security - FEYE, FTNT, PANW, CRWD, OKTA, SPLK, ZS
3. Communication as a platform service - TWLO, RNG, KLR
4. Data analytics - SNOW, PLTR, MDB, NEWR, DT, DDOG, SUMO, DDOG
5. REIT - EQIX, DLR, CONE, QTX

I have left data storage and computing as these are mostly done by the big cloud players. Data storage has many players other than the big ones like BOX as well. 

I have left out the big cloud players like AMZN, GOOG, MSFT etc as well since they fall into more than one category and cloud is not their main business. 

I wanted to get some feedback. Any names that I should include. I am mostly looking at companies that are new even though some names like AKAM and RXT are old.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As everyone has noticed, SPACs have put investors on notice in 2020. With massive liquidity in the markets today, tons of money has been flowing into speculative SPAC investments this year. Given that retail investors have no chance to profit from traditional IPOs that hit the market after a 100% run up (ABNB, DASH, AI, U, etc.) SPACs have presented an excellent opportunity to evaluate and invest in new companies before they actually hit the market. Personally, I have made fantastic returns through a number of SPACs. That being said, not all SPACs are created equal. Some legitimate mature companies and high growth disrupters have emerged through SPACs: Utz, DraftKings, ChargePoint, OpenDoor, Virgin Galactic, Eos Energy, and Butterfly are just a few examples. However, many SPACs are performance chasing the EV hype by pursuing multi billion dollar acquisitions of EV start ups with 0 revenue for the forseeable future. I say good luck. 

&#x200B;

One SPAC with massive upside potential at a conservative valuation is DMYD-Genius Sports. First, who is DYMD? dMY Technology Group [https://www.dmytechnology.com/team](https://www.dmytechnology.com/team) is led by CEO Niccolo de Masi, the former CEO of Glu Mobile. De Masi has consummated 25+ mergers and raised more than $1B in funding for various ventures. He seems to have a knack for the mobile/gaming sector, as his first SPAC: DMYT is taking Rush Street, an igaming company, public. De Masi is a veteran of this sector, which makes Genius Sports Group an interesting target.

&#x200B;

Who is Genius Sports? Genius Sports Group is one of two large sports data providers (the other being SportRadar) that collects and sells live data to sportsbooks. This is incredibly important, as live betting needs constantly adjusted lines to reflect real time game updates. Genius Sports currently has contracts with the NCAA, PGA, NASCAR, FIBA, EPL, Bundesliga, and NBA, among other leagues, to be their sole or primary data provider. These partnerships have staying power, as these leagues are unlikely to change partners once they are locked in for multiyear contracts. Additionally, acquiring rights to official league data is expensive, thus making a high barrier of entry for new competitors. They have 220 customers including DraftKings, FanDuel, William Hill, MGM, PointsBet, and Caesars. Important to note: Genius takes 5% of revenues of events they cover from ALL sportsbooks.  [https://geniussports.com/home/partners/](https://geniussports.com/home/partners/)

&#x200B;

Genius is above other SPACs due to its mature market position and strong financials. The company has been growing at a 30% CAGR over the last several years, with revenue growing 250% from 2016 to 2020 ($42M to $145M). 60% of revenue is recurring due to multi year contracts, and the top 10 customers only account for 30% of revenue, thus lowering flight risk of any particular customer. Genius is already EBITDA positive with 10% margins this year, and anticipates $68M in adjusted EBITDA (adjusted to ignore stock based compensation, a non-cash expense) with 29% margins in two years. 

&#x200B;

In a year where sports were disrupted by Covid, Genius still grew revenue from $116M to $145M. They also successfully resigned their contract with the NBA, ensuring a multi-year partnership with the premiere US basketball league. Outside of the betting market, Genius’s ability to aggregate data has led to an interesting agreement with the NCAA. Until 2018, live data with college sports was incredibly inefficient. Genius signed a contract with the NCAA to create a new software: NCAA Livestats [https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/](https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/). This is a uniform software for all divisions of college sports. As a former college athlete myself, I reached out to some of the athletic support staff from my university. They raved about how Genius has improved efficiency and accuracy for college athletics. NCAA Livestats has overhauled the entire industry.

&#x200B;

I also think the NCAA presents the biggest upside catalyst for Genius: March Madness. March Madness was cancelled due to the pandemic last year, but betters placed $4.8B in bets on the tournament in 2019. Who has a monopoly on NCAA data? Genius. Who gets a 5% revenue share from ALL sports books for NCAA events? Genius. With the number of states with legalized betting doubling from 2018 to 2020, we could see upwards of $10B spent on March Madness this year.

&#x200B;

Along with March Madness, secular tailwinds for sports betting suggest high upside for Genius moving forward. 46 out of 50 states have either passed or presented legislation to legalize sports betting. As states such as NY, CA, TX, and FL legalize betting, revenues streams will swell. Data will become increasingly important in this industry as live updates are constantly moving betting lines for books. With multi-year contracts with half of the US’s professional leagues, Genius serves as an index for the entire industry.

&#x200B;

Additionally, with Pfizer’s vaccine approval, there is little to no risk of massive sports cancellations in the future. Genius still grew revenue during Covid’s massive disruption. I imagine that the revenue numbers for 2021 will be fantastic.

&#x200B;

Now let’s focus on the stock movement and valuation. Genius is valued as $1.4B, or 7.4x 2021 revenues. For a company with high CAGR and an industry with massive tailwinds, this seems like a fair, or cheap valuation. Note that Genius is trading at a steep discount to lower margin businesses such as sportsbooks Golden Nugget, DraftKings, and Penn. While investors have been chasing the next hot EV IPO, Genius has slowly climbed from $10 to $13. Last summer, a rumored FEAC-SportRadar merger led to FEAC pumping to $15+. SportRadar was worth $2.8B in 2018, presenting 60% upside from Genius’ current price to reach its competitor’s 2018 valuation! DMYD and Genius announced their merger in late October during a market downturn, thus letting it go overlooked. I think this is a sleeper SPAC that will have a massive influx of news in Q1, as its merger aligns with the climax of college basketball and the beginning of March Madness. A single Benzinga article pumped the stock by almost 20% last week. Imagine the upside when the broader market realizes they can invest in the data behind the sports betting industry. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I am long $166k in DMYD stock, and have no intention of selling anytime soon. Always do your own DD, but I hope this post helps._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Observation: The 10-year US Treasury Yield **TL;DR- be wary of current yields, unless the Federal Reserve continues to march the Monetary Base (significantly) higher.**

Dating back to 1962, the 10-year median of the 10-year US treasury note yield (nominal) and the Savings to Monetary Base ratio has a R2=0.98; see graph here \[1\]: [https://imgur.com/a/7kqAJf7](https://imgur.com/a/7kqAJf7) . For this purpose, Savings is simply defined as Disposable Personal Income less Personal Consumption Expenditures, seasonally adjusted annual rate, in dollars. 

Simplistically, the 10-year US treasury note yield is on average roughly 4x greater than (edit: correction from 5x) that of the Savings to Monetary Base Ratio, i.e. if the Savings to Monetary Base Ratio is 1, then the 10Y yield is 5%.

Presently, the 10-year median of the Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.433x. The 10-year median of the 10Y yield is 2.21%, highlighted in the linked graph above as "Present Day".

The Federal Reserves monetary policies and actions have driven the monetary base significantly higher since 2008, from roughly $850 billion in mid-2008 to over $5,000 billion since last reported. Over the same period of time, savings has increased as well, from roughly $850 billion to over $2,800 billion last reported.

Impacts from COVID-19 to both spending and the monetary base are reflected in the numbers above. As last reported (October 2020), the Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.58x, while the 10Y yield was 0.88%.

This graph shows Savings and the Monetary Base beginning shortly prior to the Global Financial Crisis (same scale) \[2\]: [https://imgur.com/a/0eDEOBX](https://imgur.com/a/0eDEOBX) 

A narrower timeframe of 2-years (median) indicates that the present level for Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.56x and the 10Y yield is 1.69%, R2=0.925, graphed here \[3\]: [https://imgur.com/a/LoNhLil](https://imgur.com/a/LoNhLil) 

The “gap” between the median for the Savings to Monetary Base ratio and the 10Y yield, for these two timeframes (2y and 10y, or graph \[1\] and \[3\]), was only wider between Q3 1981 and Q2 1982, or when the bear market is US treasury prices ended. Unlike that period, the gap reflects extreme overvaluation of the 10y treasury note price, i.e. yields are “too” low.

To correct this, yields do not have to go higher. Rather, an ever-rising monetary base relative to savings can bring that ratio back in line with the current 10Y yield. Given local and world events, this possibility remains high.

If, rather, savings outpaces the monetary base, then history argues yields are too low; this accounts for Fed policies post-2008, such as Quantitative Easing (QE). Assuming no changes in the savings to monetary base ratio (false assumption), fair value for the 10-year is between 2.00%-2.25% over the next 24 months.

Assuming yields are fair value now, and the trend of higher savings in dollar terms continues (since 2008), I would expect that the monetary base to at least double in the very near future; let’s call that 24 months. In August 2019, the monetary base stood at $3,200 billion. By May 2020, that number rose to $5,150 billion due to the impacts from COVID-19.

This was a tremendous jump in fortune: Musk was only at 36th place in January 2020.

So as the tech industry booms away and the bull market for the time being seems to be continuing, what is everyone’s opinion on the resurgence of airline/travel industry for 2021 and when people can travel again? 

Surely the airline industry will pick up again with people flying globally again. Few of the stocks I looked at are; 

UAL - United Airlines Holdings. 
Current Price: $48.36
Price pre-covid: $90+

DAL - Delta Airlines 
Current Price: $41.74
Price pre-covid: $55+ 

AC - Air Canada 
Current Price: $26.16
Price pre-covid: ~$50

AAL - American Airlines Group
Current Price: $17.05
Price pre-covid: ~$25

LUV - Southwest Airlines Co. 
Current Price: $45.88
Price pre-covid: ~$54 

SAVE - Spirit Airlines 
Current Price: $26.23
Price pre-covid: ~$38

Am I the only person thinking that 2021 into 2022 will be booming for the travel industry? Everyone who has missed out on trips, all the young people who go backpacking to figure out who they want to be, all those that couldn’t see family for over a year, with the whole economy picking back up. 

Now some of you may ask if I’m so bullish on the travel industry and airlines in particular, why did I wait til now to consider them? Particularly the uncertainty regarding covid and how long the solution will take. With the vaccine here, we’re still at least 6 months to a year out until normal is a thing, in my opinion, but some of these stocks still have massive upside, no? 

For example UAL, one of the largest airliners in the world. Currently about half the valuation it was pre-covid, surely there must be a 50% upside in the next 1-2 years? Even if there is a 50% upside it would still only be about 75% of its valuation it was pre-covid. I can definitely see some of these companies returning to permanent levels below where they were before, because of the uncertainty and risk of something like covid happening again.

Now I'm not really sure why that is, maybe some of you might be able to provide some insight on that?Of course I'm aware that the recovery of other stocks doesn't properly reflect their current situation accurately, but why exactly this didn't happen to AT&T is a bit of a riddle to me.However, since the stocks development over the past 10 years looks pretty solid (considering the consistently respectable dividend yield) I'm under the impression that the stock is a pretty good buy right now. Would you agree?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IPOs and the billionaire craze I’m pondering over the rationale of retail investors investing in IPOs at market open. Seems to me like billionaires are created at market open by retail investors lining the pockets of the angel investors and pre-IPO investors, with the marked difference between the IPO price and the price at open. 

When the share price at market open is 2x or 3x the IPO price, the stock is already overvalued at this point, and the race is on for the retail investor to break even, if he/she buys at market open. You may get a marginal increase initially, followed by a 50/50 chance of it staying flat or going down, after trading starts. 

What do you guys think is a good difference between the IPO price and the market open price? 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x?

The stock market seems to be churning out billionaire founders, angel investors, and pre-IPO investors. The retail investor is left holding the bag.

Money doesn’t disappear in the stock market. Somebody took it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The big problem with this and other 'big' subreddits - Popular stocks and funds. This will probably be downvoted because it goes against the grain of popular thought here.

The big problem with this subreddit and why you really shouldn't listen to anything here if you are new and naïve to investing is the constant jumping on bandwagons.

The reason why 90% of investors simply do not beat the market indexes is due to jumping on popular stocks and funds after they have been hyped up to stupid price levels.

Here are some examples:- Tesla- Nio- Ark funds

The reason I put Ark in their is because retail investors keep pumping ark up on every single subreddit every day. Here's the fact: It's performed very well *recently* in a 10 year bull market. It has yet to prove itself long term and investing is all about long term.

Tesla and nio are simply in EV bubbles, the EV space is similar to where the dot com was in 2000. It doesn't matter how good a company is if you are buying it for way over it's intrinsic value.

Peter lynch mentioned this in his book. Retail investors constantly switch to the best performing funds in recent years. **These funds then lagg behind the market index. Probably due to their holdings becoming overvalued compared to fundamentals.**

A lot of you guys here need to understand that. Also, just because I am a bear on these stocks/funds doesn't mean I am going to short them because that's timing the market.

Edit: It seems a lot of people agree with me here. So I created a new subreddit for proper analysis of undervalued stocks using data & numbers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot\_a\_great\_company\_undervalued\_by\_43/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot_a_great_company_undervalued_by_43/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Insider Share Sale Impact on Price How much of insider/restricted shares introduced into the free float (maybe post a lock-up period) drag down the share price?

Would be great if someone can answer this with some empirical examples - If the free float is 15% and X% is introduced into the market very suddenly from the restricted portion. **(1) What is the minimum X that would have any significant impact on the price and (2) If there is X% introduced typically what is the Y impact in price?** 

Very specific example question - Let's a company goes public with 15% of the total holding on offer to the public. If employees that hold shares as part of ESOPs are 5% of the total holding and post listing sell their shares what type of impact could this have on the price?

Specially, I’ve found Carvana to almost always have high prices that are consistently a few thousand more than the market value for the used cars they sell. Yelp reviews for every location I have found have been very low, with most complaining either about mechanical issues or issues with transferring the title post close.

Wayfair is basically a gigantic Chinese dropshipping operation and whenever I reverse image search products I almost always find the exact same product on Amazon or Walmart or Home Depot or direct for much less even though it appears like it’s on sale on Wayfair. More so the quantity of complaints on Twitter are extremely high, with a lot of people with issues on long delivery timelines or broken/cracked furniture with little help from the company. 

And yet despite both companies having what seems like shady business practices of both overcharging for products and having bad customer service people still buy from them. It’s like the antithesis of the Zappos mantra but they get business due to a combination of relentless ad buys, unsuspecting new customers, lazy people who don’t care, and people who otherwise don’t realize they are being ripped off. 

I honestly can’t tell if we’re in a new era where your average person has become too trusting of online companies, and mostly don’t realize how easily they are being tricked via dark patterns and nice looking websites or just don’t care because they value the convenience of shopping online over a dealership or going to a store._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Morgan Stanley - they claim address on my license is a PO box address Hi,

A new report suggests that Toyota is going to unveil an electric car with a new solid-state battery that enables 10-minute fast-charging capacity next year.
Toyota started working on solid-state batteries back in 2017 with plans to commercialize the batteries inside electric vehicles in the early 2020s.
Now, Nikkei Asia is out with a new report about Toyota’s plans to unveil a car powered by the next-generation battery as soon as next year:

“The technology is a potential cure-all for the drawbacks facing electric vehicles that run on conventional lithium-ion batteries, including the relatively short distance traveled on a single charge as well as charging times. Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s. The world’s largest automaker will unveil a prototype next year.”

The report claims that the new battery will enable 500 km (310 miles) of range and charging in just 10 minutes.

It is a bus operator mostly.Probably in a sector that will benefit most from covid recovery+ vaccinations.Core business offerings are non-discretionary, and likely to become more competitive during a recession.Part of the "going green" trend, with 80% of its fleet energy efficient, planning on making it 100% by 2021 April.

Nearly a monopoly on coach travel in the uk.Enormously established in spain, largest operator. Recently gained 240m yearly new contract.Operates most in USA with multi-year school bus contracts.Recently started operating a train service in Germany that has increased (!) in profits in 2020.

Made a profit under COVID (not sunk into debt). 10p per share in first half of 2020.In July, it reported that revenue had dropped 40%.However month on month comparisons from July show revenue increasing back to normal, from -60% in April, to -35% in July.

\+14% growth of profit year on year , with the trend continuing this year up until covid. +65% (in 2019) over 4 year period.
