 DD on UBER vs LYFT Thought on Uber vs Lyft, i want to hold Uber long term and i know they're definitely a great pick with their business model. After checking their stats and doing my own DD on Uber. I got side tracked looking at Ubers competitor Lyft. It seems Lyft has a lot better finances than Uber. Their P/S is lower, Debt is way lower and have a better EBITDA. Now looking at their earning too. Am i missing something about Lyft, Uber has Uber Eats and Uber seems to be more of a popular name. Lyft has a partnership with Grubhub.

They seem like a good pick but I'm definitely going to stick with Uber, Uber is still superior and i like Uber as a business.

these are the stocks i have invested in: 

ENPH (up 84%) 

NET ( up 70%)

ICLN ( up 33%) my biggest holding by far (gift from my dad)

ARKF ( up 7%)

IBDRY (up 7%)

AMD ( up .40%)

&#x200B;

I bought alot most of these late august, and since then they have exploded. my question is, most of these stocks seem overvalued right, now, so would it make sense buying more shares at these heavily inflated prices?

&#x200B;

the reason i have not bought a vanguard index ETF is cause alot of them are quite expensive for the money i have on hand.

I have been trying to contain my excitement for awhile because I honestly didn't want this company to become a meme or anything (I totally did not help with some of my posts about it) but I do want to share my understanding about the tech and this company. I'll try to refrain from posting any useless information that's just going to come off a pumping the stock from now on.

**Let me just start this off by requesting that we leave out the ethical and morality discussions and focus on the technology. I do not know enough and thus do not deserve to have opinions regarding the philosophical aspects of the technology. The only thing I can say for certain is that for better or worse, this technology will change lives.**

I'll begin with the basics, I'm going to try to simplify it as much as I can, but it does help if you have some general understanding about software and how a computer works....

# Natural Language Processing

Imagine that we have a big email data set, terabytes of emails collected. We want to find out whenever a person named John Doe, who lives in Iowa, was mentioned or involved in an email chain. We task a data analyst, engineer, or a developer to find all this data points.

>No problem, I'll just write up some code that identifies the email by the sender and recipient with John Doe's email address.

A naive approach. This approach would definitely find emails that involved John Doe but completely miss out any mentions of John Doe that did not have him involved the in the email chain, not to mention, you would need a list of all of John Doe's emails which may be information that is already hard to come by.

>Ok, I can cover my bases by searching for the word John Doe in the subject and body email.

Great, we pulled in more data that could be emails talking about John Doe. Then you realize the fact that people call him Johnny Boy, JD, Joe, Mr. Doe, Doe Man.

>Well shit, how can I possibly cover every permutation of this person's name? Not to mention, there seems to be other John Doe that doesn't seem to be the same John Doe who lives in Iowa that we are looking for coming back in the results.

Hopefully you can start to see the problem. It would be impossible for a programmer telling the machine what to look for to come up with every possible permutations and edge cases to find the information we are looking for. You think to yourself, we're going to have to hire thousands of people to read through terabytes of data to identify the emails we want. Then you start to think, how would a human actually identify John Doe from text and determine that THAT is the John Doe we are looking for? The answer is in the context of the email. If the person is talking about Johnny Boy's burger shack in Iowa, it's likely the John Doe we're looking for. But if the person is talking about Mr. Doe's investment firm in Panama, then that's probably another Mr. Doe (though a pretty shady one if you'd ask me).

Now, how do we get a computer to understand a context of words, how can we transfer that skill to a computer program? We can use machine learning. Humans can identify examples of John Doe and teach the machine that this is what we are looking for, through a feed back loop we can continually improve the understanding of this "model" and teach the machine to identify the specific block of information we are looking for.

Obviously this doesn't just work for names. You can be specific as you want and as general as you want. Say phone numbers, (111) 222-3333 can be written as 111-222-3333, 111.222.3333, 111 222 3333, 111 CAB-3333, and the list goes on.

# Natural Language Understanding

Ok, we now want to find out where he's been and what he has been up to. How we an engineer go about solving this problem? Again, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to accomplish this. We know how to identify entities, we can actually apply the same concepts we used to teach the machine how to identify John Doe.

    He's booking a flight to Moscow for 01/02/2023

We already know that "He's" is referring to John Doe. We know that "Moscow" is a location through Natural Language Processing and we know that "01/02/2023" is a date through named-entity recognition. We can teach the machine that this is an example of travel and label this whole sentence as a "movement". We hope that the machine can identify and trace is location just by all the cookie crumbs left behind. We can then build a map of all the places he's been to by tracing all the identified "movement" points, sort them by date grab the locations.

# Why Palantir

A lot of the criticisms have detailed how a lot of this technology is open sourced which is true. A lot of this tech are still popular academia research topics. This also means that there are progress being made to it every single day. However, the concepts and technology may be open sources but the features and methods you build around it determine the effectiveness of the product. There is a popular saying in academia that goes like this.

>Garbage in, garbage out

Using the same technique in training your models may yield results but doesn't technically mean they would yield great results. Generating a good model has a lot to do with how clean your data is, how well you tuned the learning process, how well your features and weights are built around the algorithm.

When government/businesses consider using these products, they usually create a bake-off and analyze the performance and features included in each product. They use metrics like precision/recall that determines how many data points that the machine identified from the truth set and how many data points that the machine missed. These metrics are important to the clients for many reasons one of which is because it can potentially mean they miss or waste time on data points that lead them to nowhere and is particularly important for applications like defense. If the government picked Palantir, you can be confident that they are the top of their class.

# Challenges

A lot of posts have mentioned that Palantir sends consultants and is therefore a consulting company. Which I don't disagree that their "Forward Deployed Engineers" are technically consultants. However, these consultants DO serve a purpose. The concepts and applications here are still being discovered in the market today. I'd like to think of these consultants as technical sales consultants. Companies today don't necessarily understand the value of their data and what can be done with it. A lot of their data are just noise today. They store it and are unable to do anything with this. **It is necessary for someone with the skillset to come in and build the foundations required/clean up the data for companies to start leveraging it.** However once the value becomes visible, it seems to be a very sticky proposal and becomes evident that it is a leg up among their competitors. We don't currently have enough talent in the work force today that have the ability to come in and shift the data analysis landscape. It is also very expensive to do inhouse. Having Palantir come in with their consultants is really just these companies dipping their toe in to the ocean for the benefits that is to come.

# Last thing

Hopefully this gives you guys a bit more information about Palantir's tech and realize that you guys can see how a little bit of creativity in extracting information from data using the tools Palantir provides is game changing.

I will leave you all this this xkcd comic that I found was very representative of the problem at hand. Sometimes, it can be difficult to explain the difference between the the easy and the virtually impossible.

Thanks very much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I'm bearish on V & MA, but still love FinTech * In FY 2019 before COVID-19:
   * International Transaction revenue for V = 34.0% of Net Revenue
   * Cross-border Volume revenue for MA = 33.2% of Net Revenue

&#x200B;

* The latest quarter y/y change for V's International Transaction revenue:
   * \-38.3% revenue decrease
   * Cross-border volume x Intra-Europe = -41%

&#x200B;

* The latest quarter y/y change for MA's Cross-Border revenue:
   * \-47.9% revenue decrease
   * Cross-border volume x Intra-Europe = -49%

**My concerns about V and MA**: Both companies during their recent earnings call said personal travel should pick-up quickly once a vaccine is widely distributed, while business travel will take longer. **I agree**. They both mentioned that personal travel is "more substantial" than business travel. Neither company quantified how much of their International Transaction/Cross-border volume is in jeopardy because of the permanent impairment of business travel so that's a major red flag, especially when you consider how important that revenue category is to both companies' top-line and bottom-line since these transactions tend to be higher-yielding than domestic transactions. Without a clear answer, **there's a real risk that International Transaction revenue/Cross-border volume revenue and profit may disappoint after a vaccine is distributed because of business travel.** Both stocks have held up well despite underwhelming results for a FinTech during the pandemic, but investors may need to rerate shares if performance is consistent with my concerns.

**Why I could be wrong**: V & MA may benefit from accelerated cash displacement and get volume from lower-yield transactions. But, it's not clear if it will be enough to offset the higher-yield international transactions. It certainly wasn't enough for either companies for the current quarter.

**Why I still love FinTech**: Besides travel, a lot of wonderful secular trends are benefitting the industry and will only accelerate due to the COVID pandemic.

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Additionally, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Furthermore the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: For those than cannot find the poll and are interested, [It can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeking advice in this subreddit about what certain stocks are going to do in the future is the equivalent of asking the same to a magic 8 ball. I know similar stuff has been said here, but I keep seeing this problem still. This sub is great to look at DD’s at stocks and to get good stock news. However, it is incredibly ridiculous the amount of posts and comments here asking what x stock is going to do or how the stock market is going to perform next month. I would've thought it would be just the people who are new to the stock market or this subreddit, but there are actually a large number of people here that have been posting/commenting on the subreddit for a while, meaning they aren't new here and they STILL do this. 

However, this isn't even the main problem. The actual problem is the people who reply to these posts/comments and they act like they know what they are talking about so they will say some BS with 100% confidence which probably will influence many of the people who don't know any better. The more you think about it, the more concerning it actually becomes. I don't believe ignorance warrants someone to getting screwed over so just because someone is dumb enough to trust a random redditor and lose money doesn't mean they deserve it. This is very serious stuff since this is literally people's money and I wish more people realized how awful it is that people will come here and look at any advice and dump their money into a random stock and then come back later with major losses.

**I think this even applies to most people on this subreddit but at a more subliminal level**. I have a feeling that there are many people here that still are prone to this, even if they don't blatantly listen to random people. For example, pretty much everyone in this subreddit agreed to not buy anything during March because "the bottom hasn't come yet". I have even seen posts asking if the stimulus package would help the stock market and people pretty much agreed that it wasn't going to do much (you can look at the threads if you want). People would reply to these posts with absolute confidence; not a "probably not" or "I don't think so", but a "It's not going to do x". When these posts/comments are constantly upvoted and replicated, this can even influence the people who disagreed, creating a conformity effect based on majority social influence and not factual information. 

I guarantee you there are people here who were interested in buying in March when stocks were at a very low price, looked at this subreddits opinions, and ended up not buying them because the majority of people said not to. When in reality, that would've been the ideal thing to do, and they could've made a lot of money. I don't know how these types of posts and comments are so popular on this subreddit, but they are. I am making this post to remind people of these things, and I don't want the same thing to happen to as many people in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV Bubble Pop Is Going to Leave so Many Bagholders in This Sub The amount of posts stating “I’ve made so much money on NIO, BLNK, XPNG, LI, etc. but EVs are the future and I’m not selling” are nuts.

Yeah EVs probably are the future, but when everything EV related is flying (Blink has $4M in revenue and a $600M+ market cap, that’s 150 P/S ratio lmao) they’re all going down together soon.

Take profits, selling is as if not more important than buying. For the “if it’s a longterm investment don’t time the market” and “idc if it dips I’m holding for years, cost doesn’t matter in the longterm” quit being ignorant.

Cost basis 100% matters in the longterm, buying a stock now vs buying after a 50% decline will lead to a massive multiple difference in returns down the road if it performs well.

I’m new to the stock market and I’m 20 years old I can’t invest yet since I’m really short on cash but with in the next couple of months I should be able to correct my financial mistakes and start saving some buffer money. Then after that I will start investing. Meanwhile I want to do lots of quality research so I can make educated investments.

I thought of some things that I should consider when investing but whenever I try to look them up about a company I can’t find it. For example I would try to look at what kind of insurance policies a company has but I would get weird results from google. I want to build a profile on most of the things that can go wrong with a company and what they have going for them but its hard to do that with google. Also, the news only updates me on what is happening right now which doesn’t help. 

TL:DR- how do I find out quality info on companies (like insurance policies, risks, Ceo’s history, possible things that can go wrong, advantages, ect.) Google and the news alone don’t seem like enough._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
> Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
> In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
> “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
> “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
> Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
> The S&P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
> JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
> “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
> But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
> The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
> The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
> Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
> Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
> “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
> She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

> # The Thanksgiving Trade

> Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&P 500 decline was in 1964.

> Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**

> Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

> # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

> First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> After Monday’s record close, the S&P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

> The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

> Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-retail-by-category.png))**

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # Finally A New High for Small Caps

> It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

> The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

> # A Month for the Ages

> Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

> In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

> In the large-cap S&P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

> While just about every stock in the S&P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

> # Long Term Averages Taken Out

> With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

> As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

> In the table below, we show a list of the S&P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

> # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

> Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

> Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I want to sell 1/3 of my Apple shares. Need honest opinions. So Apple makes up 44% of my current portfolio. This, to me, is too high. Coupled with the fact that Apple is my worst performing stock, I want to pull a Buffett and reduce my Apple holdings by 1/3. This will still make Apple my largest
holding, but it will pull it down to about 30% of my portfolio. Which stocks would you recommend I consider instead? Current holds as follows:

Apple
Nio
Tesla
Plug
Pinterest

Looking for something ideally large growth or potentially higher risk hyper growth. Not really into "safe" stocks with lower growth or the FAANGs. 

Thank you in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are the undervalued electric vehicle or hydrogen stocks right now (November 21, 2020)? Most of the stocks I’ve checked out have risen 100-2000% in the last few months (NIO, LI, WKHS, PLUG, BLDP, etc.). Does anyone know of any electric vehicle, hydrogen, or related stocks that haven’t shot the moon yet?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on NIO? I just bought in a week weeks ago after FOMO for months. But lot of industry thinkers like below seem to believe it’s overvalued. I thought the same about Tesla for months and then got sick of watching ppl double their money. How do you analyze these sorts of stocks?

https://investorplace.com/2020/11/avoid-nio-stock-as-it-enters-full-bubble-mode-cseo/amp/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ InvestorPlace: 3 Quantum Glass Stocks for the Future of Batteries (QuantumScape / QS included) On November 20, Faizan Farooque wrote an article in InvestorPlace listing three stocks involved in the holy grail of EV.  The article is titled "3 Quantum Glass Stocks for the Future of Batteries."

[I can't provide the link because one of the tickers goes against this subreddit's rules.]

The three picks are Samsung, Panasonic, and QuantumScape.  I'll focus on the third, the **electric vehicle battery supplier backed by Volkswagen and even Bill Gates himself**.  Past discussions can be found here:

[Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, to "IPO" (QS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ja0oq3/bill_gatesbacked_electric_vehicle_battery/)

[QuantumScape (QS): Upside of 100% or More? (Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jts3au/quantumscape_qs_upside_of_100_or_more_bill/)

The ticker QS will come live in just a week's time.

Anyways, on to to relevant quotes from Farooque's article:

> Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY)-backed QuantumScape, a manufacturer of large-capacity solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Volkswagen will use the company exclusively for its EV needs. Being the European EV market leader, the fastest-growing EV market on the planet should be reason enough for you to be bullish.

> However, it would help if you were patient with this stock. All of the parties involved said they have enough funds to back its ambitions. But the issue is cost-effectiveness and managing demand. Since we are dealing with experimental technology, those issues can be resolved in due time. You need to hang tight and believe in the concept.

*Disclosure: Long on warrants.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I bought 150 shares of CRSR at 17.36 and i'm not sure what to do with them Hey so i've bought CRSR near its IPO because I used to play games when i was younger and knew the company has great products and the numbers looked good and I figured it might go to the 25-30 range maybe next year and i could double my money.

Less than 2 months later its already at 40$ and i made more than 100% on my shares. I always compared CRSR to LOGI in terms of where i see it going in the future but this insane run is making me both happy and nervous. I'm not even sure anymore what my exit point is and whether i should let it run or take my profits now. 

&#x200B;

I don't need the money right now and can easily let it sit on it for another year or more but im having trouble (im a new investor and CRSR is my first stock that made so much profit) figuring out what do with it now so i look for advice from you guys. Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PLTR - sell or cover with options? Hi all,

Fairly new to trading, currently own some quite good performing stocks (Palantir, NIO, Xpeng) which are all above +80% at least. I have a lot of faith in NIO and Xpeng so will keep those as is but bit more skeptical about Palantir. Just wanted to discuss how to move forward and get some advice from some Wall Street veterans.

At this point Palantir is at an almost 100% profit for me (bought around $9 and now at $18). These are the ways I want to go:

\- Sell all my Palantir stock at 100% profit (or add a stop loss) but also buy some long term 2021 Call options in case the stock price still rises to still have some gains and not kick myself in the head for the next years.

\- Keep all my Palantir stocks but buy some Put options to protect myself incase the stock price will suddenly drop.

Obviously I don't expect anyone to look into the future, but just want some advice on how I can use options to slightly protect myself for making a stupid decision, or hear reassurance PLTR will keep performing over the next years.

Thanks in advance mates!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it too late to buy into BABA? I'm late to the party (didnt have enough capital before) but the share price is so high right now. I have enough to maybe get 10 shares of BABA but I don't know if it would be a smart choice at this point. Any advice?

Note: I am not in need of cash so I would be planning on holding long term_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DBX getting more popular. Opinion? What are your opinions In Dropbox? Since this summer I see more and more people on YouTube, Reddit and on other platforms that talk about Dropbox as If it is the next great tech darling. I like DBX and I think it will do well, but I doubt it will quadrouple in the next 5 years as some suggest.

Also, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.

Here are my thoughts:

Talking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.

Financials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.

Product. I use dropbox at work and at home with my family and I really like the fact that it's UI is easy to understand and use, when comparing it to OneDrive and GoogleDrive. So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. 

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.
Pretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.
CEO and co-founder leaves the company
Meh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.


Based on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.

I can't find any info on timing after looking at other investing websites or the company website._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
