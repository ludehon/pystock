it might sound counter-intuitive but the theory put forward by two Yale professors (Ayres & Nalebuff) in their book called **Lifecycle Investing** proposes a leveraged index investment strategy to improve the risk-return profile for long term index / ETF investors. In the following I will shortly outline the basics concerning this strategy and would like to infer if somebody has successfully applied this theory (or somewhat differently) in practise. 

&#x200B;

\***Why should one use this strategy?\***

If you don't inherit a lot of money, when starting to invest, you most likely accumulate wealth at a somewhat exponential rate throughout your life. This means that your risk exposure is likely to be very tilted. In practise this means that in your early years (20-40) you have relatively little money invested compared to what you will likely have in your investment account when retiring (60+). 

&#x200B;

\***What is the goal?\***

Your goal is to control more of your target equity value early on.  Basically you compute a certain dollar amount that you want to hold in equities at the moment of retiring (based on current savings and future income x savings rate). Let's say for me this is $500k but I am still very far from controlling such a large sum. To achieve this you use leverage in your early years (max 2:1) and deleverage over the years. Clearly, even with a 2:1 leverage ratio I still need several years until I can start decreasing the leverage to effectively control $500k. 

&#x200B;

\***Managing risk\***

We all know the concept of compounded interest, so gains in your early years affect you very positively  later on.  While you are exposed to more risk when using leverage you can effectively only loose a relatively small dollar amount compared to what you are likely to own in the long term (20+ years - less leverage then). Therefore, the authors point out that even with a very strong market correction in the early years of your investment career you are still able to catch up.

&#x200B;

\***Leverage over time\***

2:1 Fully leveraged: Approximately first 13 working years

Partially leveraged (>2:1 leverage): Approximately 14 working years

No leverage: Last 17 working years 

&#x200B;

\***How to implement the theory effectively\***

Buy long term LEAP call options on a broad market index such as the S&P 500 with an expiration date of at least two years in the future. They need to be deep in the money (cost: approx. 50% of the underlying) to get a 2:1 leverage. Over time you would have to swap the options in order to still have approximately the 2:1 exposure. 

&#x200B;

\***Why this theory might fail in practise\***

This basically boils down to human psychology and the tendency to change strategy over the course of time. The authors  show that this strategy has proven to either yield higher returns or a lower standard deviation if implemented as outlined. However, the average investor is unlikely to implement this theory so stringently over time (due to unforeseen circumstances etc.). Especially in the event of loosing all savings (in a crash such as COVID) most investors would probably go back to a simple buy & and hold strategy without leverage. 

&#x200B;

\***What am I doing with this knowledge\***

I read their book quite enthusiastically but would at most dedicate 20% of my portfolio to rolling LEAP contracts on a large index over the next 10 years. Firstly, I am too risk-averse to loose all my portfolio if something unforeseen happens and secondly I don't want to put all my eggs into one basket. 

&#x200B;

I mean sure if you want to rebalance your portfolio and realsie your gains on the 10.000 you could do this to avoid taxes, but again depending on why that -10.000 is in -10.000 it doesnt make sense to sell for future upside.

Good luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shopify Analysis (NYSE: SHOP)  **Industry Overview**

Shopify competes in the broad e-commerce industry. Competitors include Amazon, eBay, Etsy, BigCommerce, and many other companies. Competitors are either platforms like Amazon that connects buyers and sellers or software companies that offer the same or similar services to Shopify. The e-commerce market is broad and is always expanding. It has seen tremendous growth during COVID-19 and it will likely continue growing long afterward.

E-commerce has been one of the largest trends over the past two decades as more and more consumers turn to Amazon or other online stores to buy products. This trend has only accelerated as COVID-19 has forced buyers online to buy many of their purchases.

**Business Overview**

Shopify was founded in 2004 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake after Lütke struggled to find competent e-commerce software to enable merchants to sell products online. Lütke, originally a computer programmer by trade, made his own software. This was the start of Shopify. The original founders eventually rebranded to Shopify after originally starting as “Snowdevil” in 2004.

Shopify provides tools for merchants (entrepreneurs, small businesses, medium businesses, and large customers) to manage storefronts. Although the traditional focus of Shopify has been to allow merchants to sell physical products online, Shopify has expanded into offering point-of-sale hardware as well as additional tools such as the Shopify Fulfillment Network, Shopify Capital, and 6 River Systems' collaborative warehouse fulfillment solutions. All these tools have been created in order to help entrepreneurs run and scale their businesses. Shopify has long term goals in place to continue to innovate and build out more services and offerings for its merchant base.

This is the primary goal of Shopify. The running slogan is that Shopify wants to “arm the rebels” and help them compete against large players like Amazon.

Shopify serves as the central nervous system for over 1 million merchants as of the end of 2019. This number has likely only increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rush to buy and sell products online. Some of the tools that merchants have access to via their store dashboard are analytics, data, inventory, orders, payments, and many other tools you can think of.

Many entrepreneurs and small businesses sell courses, digital products, or other offerings through Shopify. Although Shopify might be thought of as a company that benefits strictly from selling physical goods, this is not the case. This is another interesting point about Shopify and my personal investment thesis. Shopify is benefitting from many tailwinds such as the rise of the creator economy, direct-to-consumer brands, and entrepreneurship.

**Total Addressable Market**

Shopify's total addressable is defined as around $78bn in their financial filings, but of course, this is only growing over time. Shopify is empowering more and more people to become entrepreneurs and make it easier for anyone to sell a product or service online. Shopify is actively expanding its total addressable market.

One of the interesting ideas about innovative companies like Shopify is that these companies expand their own market. I briefly touch on this below.

For example, previously most people were deterred from starting a business because it’s too difficult, expensive, or time-consuming. Shopify changed this. Starting an online store can be as easy as spending 1 hour and $29. Previously, starting an online business required some heavy coding expertise or lots of software to piece together all the parts of an internet business. More and more people are confident to start an online store because of the ease of using Shopify and all the tools and integrations it offers.

Shopify has the potential to expand into other adjacent markets related to online commerce. This doesn’t necessarily need to be physical products or even virtual products. Any financial transaction that occurs could one day be powered by Shopify to some extent. If it’s a business trying to build a brand or a solo entrepreneur building a paid community of like-minded people then Shopify may play a role in enabling this. To some extent, Shopify already offers some of these services mainly through the partner ecosystem and all the apps that are available.

**Competitive Advantages**

From a shallow dive perspective, Shopify has a good set of competitive advantages.

* **Scale**  
Because of its size, Shopify is able to pump more money into R&D to enable new offerings to its merchant base. Smaller competitors don’t stand a chance competing against Shopify. Shopify offers more tools through its dashboard and partner ecosystem than smaller competitors will ever have time or money to build. Merchants utilize multiple services to build a complete and functioning online store. Small startups don’t stand a chance trying to build out a shipping network, offering the equivalent of Shopify Capital, or all the integrations and apps offered through the partner ecosystem.
* **Partner Ecosystem**  
This is one of the most interesting aspects of Shopify and it’s similar to many other platforms. This is a mini-network effect buried in Shopify. As more designers, developers, and other partners join Shopify’s partner ecosystem, more and more merchants will be attracted to the breadth of offerings of themes, apps, integrations, and more. This will in turn attract more partners, and more merchants, and so on.  
This is a small network effect and isn’t terribly important in the grand scheme of things on Shopify, but it sure does keep competitors out and it attracts more merchants to use Shopify. Another benefit for Shopify is that this provides a look into the future. Shopify can see which apps are most popular among merchants and Shopify can develop tools, offerings, or simply buyout these apps from developers. Shopify did this with [Oberlo](https://www.startuplithuania.com/news/shopify-has-acquired-oberlo/) in 2017.  
As more apps are developed on the platform and more competitors offer software tools for entrepreneurs, Shopify can jump ahead of the competition and buyout these tools or build something to compete with them. For example, if you believe that gated content will be popular in the future, there are already apps that exist on the Shopify platform to enable gated content for paid communities. Shopify can buyout these tools or build a similar offering from the inside to benefit from this trend.
* **Switching Costs**  
Merchants don’t want to waste time switching stores, remaking whole websites, managing inventory just to save a few bucks a month. The headache involved with switching websites and storefronts is not worth the small potential cost savings of switching from Shopify to another competitor.  
Merchants want to focus on their business rather than working on smaller details that will not vastly improve their business. Customers also become familiar with Shopify’s dashboard and the rest of the layout of the backend software leading to familiarity and increased productivity. The headache of switching and becoming familiar with the Shopify platform are some of the switching costs that give Shopify a sustainable competitive advantage.

&#x200B;

**Financials**

Shopify has some pretty incredible financial results through the end of 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated their results. These numbers are from the end of 2019, so the results during 2020 are different and may lead to a different result if you’re thinking about investing in them.

**2019:**

* Total revenue = \~$1.58bn
* Subscription solutions revenue = \~$640mn
* Merchant solutions revenue = \~$940mn
* GMV = \~$61.1bn
* Gross profit = \~$870mn

**2018:**

* Total revenue = \~$1.07bn
* Subscription solutions revenue = \~$460mn
* Merchant solutions revenue = \~$610mn
* GMV = \~$41.1bn
* Gross profit = \~$600mn

**2017:**

* Total revenue = \~$670mn
* Subscription solutions revenue = \~$310mn
* Merchant solutions revenue = \~$360mn
* GMV = \~$26.3bn
* Gross profit = \~$380mn

There are many other aspects of Shopify’s financial information to dig into such as the differences in the cost of revenues between the software-related revenue and the merchant solutions revenue. This is just a shallow dive and if you’re interested in doing a full deep dive on Shopify, do your own due diligence and valuation work.

**What’s Interesting**

Shopify is one of the few companies that has been able to compete against Amazon and be successful thus far. Amazon is a behemoth of a company and typically companies don’t survive if Amazon tries to enter their industry. Shopify is an outlier.

Shopify also benefits from some interesting tailwinds such as the move for companies to sell direct-to-consumer (DTC), e-commerce, and the creator economy that I’ll now dig into more below.

**DTC**

Many companies are skipping the traditional method of selling by going through Amazon, Walmart, or other “middlemen” and instead relying on Facebook, Google, and other advertising in order to get out in front of customers. Selling directly to consumers has multiple benefits. First, products sold directly to consumers typically have a higher gross margin. Second, companies are able to establish a brand and a direct relationship with customers when going directly to them instead of going through a middleman.

Companies like Nike, Lululemon, and many other companies (not just clothing companies) are investing in this new revenue line in order to grow profit margins. Shopify “arms the rebels” by enabling companies to establish their own brand instead of simply selling a product on Amazon where consumers might just be comparing the cheapest option.

**E-Commerce**

Everyone knows e-commerce is growing and it’s not even a majority of the total GMV sold in the world. COVID-19 has accelerated e-commerce by a decade.

**Creator Economy**

As more entrepreneurs look to create physical products, digital products, or facilitate transactions online, Shopify will serve as the foundation for many of these people. Whether it’s YouTube personalities creating merchandise or people on Twitter creating courses, communities, or gated content, Shopify will help to power many of these transactions. Shopify has the ability to empower these creators and collect a small portion of revenue based on their success.

**Future Questions**

* **Valuation?**  
Shopify has seen tremendous growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and its stock price has risen above $1,000. More work is needed to understand the long-term potential of Shopify and whether the current price gives investors a fair rate of return over the next 3-5 years. I think Shopify has many potential tailwinds but valuation may be a concern to some investors.
* **10x potential?**  
Shopify has a market cap of \~$144bn which makes it one of the largest tech companies. If you’re looking for 10x potential like I am, Shopify may not be the best company for you, but I do think it has the potential to grow. Shopify is still growing revenue at a fast rate and there seems to be a long runway of growth ahead of it.  
There are only 4 companies that are above $1tn in market cap (Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon). These are the largest companies in the world and it’s difficult to say that any company will be above $1tn, but I do think Shopify has this potential if they continue to empower entrepreneurs, small businesses, and all other businesses in the world.

**Conclusion**

Shopify is an innovative and interesting company that I believe has a long runway of growth and lots of future potential. Shopify has room to expand into other areas to help empower entrepreneurs and small businesses.

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

Discuss!

Edit : added (h) to TSLA for vertical integration,
Added AMZN_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ melt up I listen to a few financial podcasts and one individual is convinced we're in a melt up. He says the stock market is going to rocket then crash bigger than ever before. something crazy like 80%. he says there's way overvaluation with IPOs with no sales and a ton of secondaries that are setting it up to fail. He says the fed continuing to print money is what's keeping the market going and its a matter of time before the market won't move anymore based off the money printing. he talks about nasdaq looking like it did from 1982-2000 when that crashed happened but he thinks it will be worse. When I listen to these Podcasters I don't take it as hard truths. I wanted to know what you guys all thought about it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Calls - How does it work? Hi, I had some basic ideas about selling calls. I had 100+ shares of VRM and 2 weeks ago I sold a call with strike $45, expiring Dec 18th, for 0.35 per share. The stock was trading at $35.29 when I sold the call. As you can see, I collected a premium of $35 (as shown in Robinhood transaction log).

My understanding was that as long as the price of the share is below $45 on/before Dec 18th. The call option won't be exercised, and will I retain $35.

However, after I sold the call and before expiry (Dec 18th), I saw that the total return on my call sold was sometimes showing positive returns ( +12, when the option price went down to 0.23) and negative returns (-3, when the option price went up to 0.38).

[https://imgur.com/a/ebL6IUA](https://imgur.com/a/ebL6IUA)

On Dec 18th the call expired with option price at 0.01 and I ended up earning about $32 (in addition to $35 from premium). So, this is what I don't understand. I was expecting to receive only $35, the premium from selling the call.

So, why does the total return change? Does it mean that there is a chance that I could lose my premium if the option price raises after I sell a call contract? Help me understand._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are we in a dead cat bounce? Likely a stupid question. Another post mentions that 2020 had both the sharpest decline and the sharpest market recovery in history. 

I think a dead cat bounce is when a single stock rises, drops precipitously, jumps up fast and high again (cat hitting the ground) giving everyone false hope, then falls to a final low. 

This might not match up, since the market is higher now than at the bounce level in March. If not, is there any evidence that we're in the bounce (rise) phase on a market wide scale? Are there other similar behaviors at play?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to call this investment structure? There is a investment phrase or jargon I wonder if anyone of you may know how people who structure and sell it normally call it. 

To illustrate:

Alice sells an investment product to Bob. 
The investment product is as follows:

Bob leases some assets from Alice and then entrusts Alice with the commercial management of these assets. Based on the monthly profits generated by these assets, 70% of them are given to Bob and 30% to Alice.

Alice is the driving force of structuring the investment product and she is also the manager of the commercial management of running the business that is based on the assets. 

For example,the asset can be a farm land. Alice owns or have leased the farm land and are leasing or sub-leasing it to Bob. In turn, Bob entrusts Alice to commercially operate the farm and share the profit with him monthly._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is the absurd TSLA pump a speculative attack on S&P 500 passive investors? We know what it takes for a stock to be included in the index. With trillions of dollars of passive funds at play, it's an attractive target to try to suck value. 

A group could pump up the value of a stock, that is likely to be added the S&P 500 soon, to absurd levels. Then, wait until the stock is bought up by passive funds and start to dump leaving the passive fund holding the bag on way too much of a growth stock. At the same time, the fund ends up divesting from other stocks that have more reasonable valuations. 

Is this effectively a speculative attack on S&P 500 index funds? 

If this plays out with TSLA, does it just become a model for doing the same thing over and over with various meme stocks? Does this mean we're all better off moving to a total market fund? Could the same kind of speculative attacks play out with private companies before going public? 

Please do tell me where my thinking might be wrong._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airlines Secure $15B Payroll Reimbursement in Bipartisan COVID-19 Relief Deal &#x200B;

The U.S. Congress members reached a bipartisan agreement on the $900 billion COVID-19 relief package on Sunday, which included much-needed relief aid for the airlines, after elongated negotiations.

&#x200B;

What Happened: The latest tranche of the relief package includes $15 billion in aid for the airline industry as reimbursement to reinstate payrolls.

&#x200B;

The $15 billion aid comes with similar restrictions as the previous aid that expired in October. Reportedly, airline carriers will attempt to bring workers back but the period without the aid has made it difficult, according to the Airlines for America trade group.

&#x200B;

As many as 32,000 airline workers were furloughed after the last round of stimulus expired. As per an earlier report, many employees took a pay cut and expected the new relief bill to cover airline salaries through March 2021.

&#x200B;

Why It Matters: The pandemic has severely dented the airlines. Over the last seven days, airlines passenger traffic was roughly 35% compared to last year, as per Bloomberg. According to TSA data, it is the lowest year-over-year comparison since September.

&#x200B;

Airlines are losing money due to a steep drop in travel. Though lawmakers from both parties have called for more aviation support, congressional leaders have not agreed on the provisions for a broader relief bill.

&#x200B;

Apart from the $15 billion payroll aid, the bill also includes $1 billion for airline contractor payrolls, $10 billion for state highways, $2 billion for airports and airport concessionaires, $2 billion for the private motor coach, school bus, and ferry industries, and $1 billion for Amtrak, Bloomberg reports.

&#x200B;

The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Monday followed by the Senate, as per Reuters. Outgoing President Donald Trump has expressed his support and will sign the bill into law, a White House spokesperson said._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What I am doing and why I have been trading since March. I got into stocks after 2 years of investing in collectables in markets were you could go to zero in less then 30 days and liquidity was a nightmare. A 30% crash at worst seemed like a dream vacation. I read a lot of Warren Buffet, Prof Malcom and did all the TD ameritrade courses and watched about 200 hrs of youtubers, cnbc and listen to quite a few investing/trading books on Audible. I am a Jim Craimer fan and follow action alerts.

 My initial portfolio consisted of SPY Growth and consumer discretionary ETF at 75% and single stocks for the remaining 25%. Beta and sharp was decent and my single stocks I sild at 20-30% gains or cut losses at 10%. I made 25% since march but wasn't fully invested until around October. 

 The spyG was for Fang and margin of error while having some drawdown protection if I missed a trend shift. I used it as a fundraiser to repotion my portfolio for the reopening trade/rotation. I got this wrong 3 times but hit most of NOV move because there was a lot of shared volumes in both side of the " reopen/covid" bifurcation in the ETF and some of my single stcoks were Hybrids like MRVL. But SPYG is underperforming relative to value, or at least soon in my estimation so I will replace incrementally towards small cap value ETF to capture earnings growth in 2021 and have been in XLF and XLI incrementally for the last few months as a low beta way to capture recovery and resultant rise in interest rates.

 Single stocks are : Ford, GM- cheap EV exposure with tailwinds from corona cyclicality and non-cyclical EV and assumed increase in discretionary spending as our Economy improves.

 MRVL- Five g with a data center kicker, 21 pe seems cheap and M&A looks accretive

MGM- Value as opposed to Wynn. Pent up demand all over the place. A clear vaccine play as travel improves.

Simon Properties- Safish dividend, Increased market share and possible retail exposure ( they are buying all the failing anchor stores in malls) Better deal on Taubam then exspected and JC pennies for dirt cheap. Again Pent up demand and vaccine play

Dis- Pure reopen play with Netflix kicker. I cannot think of a better way to capture pent up demand while diversifying in a single stock. Parks-check, Theatres-check. Cruise lines-check. Cash on hand-check, history of stability- check The mouse, seriously got to respect that rodent.

GE- Played it as a trade and made 20 each time.. nt sure what to do with it up 11%. I like wind buisness and healthcare. The fact they went cash flow positive last quarter is nice.

I was considering buying CRSP EDIT NTLA and NVTA, however I know most people will say to just buy ARKG.

I am wondering if anyone else uses this investing strategy.

Basically, I created a baseline of 40 stocks that I feel have good long term growth potential but are relatively medium risk.  (i.e. they are not meme stocks, stocks that could easily go bankrupt in the coming years, etc.)  The stocks are all over the place - many of them are Asian/European/South American ADR stocks.  Some are US stocks.  Some are telecoms/food/semiconductors/etc.  About 70% of them pay dividends.

Then I bought one share of each of the 40 stocks to basically put them in my brokerage account portfolio.

Now, every two weeks when I get paid, 10% of my pay is direct deposited into my brokerage.  I then look at ALL of my 40 stocks and see which are the top ones that day that are trading at 3 to 5 (or even 10) year LOWS.  I then dump 100% of the money into the top 3 stocks trading at their lowest that day.

In other words, every two weeks, I only buy shares of the stocks trading at their multi year lows.  I basically think of this as going to the store and only buying stuff on sale.

So far, this has worked out well for me.

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
