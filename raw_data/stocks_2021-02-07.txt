 Uber ($108bn market cap) vs. Lyft ($17bn market cap). Is Lyft a buy now? Most people who use driver apps like Lyft/Uber aren't particularly loyal to Uber. If Uber is showing increased fares, they'll just pull open Lyft and see if they can save $3 on their ride. Some people open both apps and compare prices before booking.

So why is Uber worth 5x+ more than Lyft? Either Uber is grossly overpriced or Lyft is grossly underpriced or somewhere in between. Any thoughts on which?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What app do you recommend for investing?

Hey everybody, this is my first time making a post like this. I'm a fairly new investor - I've been having a financial advisor do most of my investing and have been wanting to take a more active role in my investment - starting with my DD on Chewy so here goes. If it's not obvious enough, I'm not a financial advisors and take my post as the ramblings of a person with limited knowledge trying his best, so here goes. 


**Overview**

Chewy was an online retailer started in Florida. In 2017 chewy was acquired by PetSmart for 3.3 billion, and the ipo was offered in 2019. 
Sales grew every year and by 2018 sales had reached 3.5 billion w/ 66% of sales being from automatic recurring shipments. Chewy reported its first loss in April 2019 selling of 270 million from its previous sales. 
**When Chewy first went public in June 2019 it's IPO offering was 22 per share. 

As of 2019 the company was valued at 10.2 billion.** 

**My insight:**

Chewy has a few different areas of products to focus on that can be separated into 2 groups: basic consumer products (furniture, toys, food, etc), prescription products (medications, rx diets), and non-prescription medical products (examples - think things like supplements, medical grade shampoos, etc etc)
I've separated it into 3 groups for a reason and I'll get to that soon. 

I've been a vet for the past few years, and working in the vet industry since 2012 as a vet tech until I graduated vet school in 2019. 
In the last two years, I've worked at several vet clinics from super low income to super high income and in between. I write prescriptions every. freakin. day. It's half of my job. And historically, most vet clinics would have an in house pharmacy holding most of the needed medications and OTC medical products (shampoos, supplements, etc) and people would buy them from us. 

Somewhere between 2015-2019 people started asking more and more for prescriptions after realizing that they could get some of their medications at regular human pharmacies. This was a big hit to vet hospitals, but we rolled with it because we still had the pet specific prescriptions that human pharmacies didn't carry, and the OTC products. 

Then in 2019 - I started seeing a massive shift where we weren't able to sell OTC products anymore. It seemed like over the course of a year, it got significantly harder to sell things like medical grade shampoos, fish oil supplements, joint supplements - all things that didnt need a prescription, but previously you could only get at the vet. Chewy came in and undercut our profits by a massive amount. I'm super involved with the finances at my current clinic and saw that for us to match chewy's prices we would either have to sell for a minuscule gain or no gain at all - to the point where it ended up costing us money if you considered the man hours it took to manage inventory and the opportunity cost of losing shelf space to these products. 

Now in 2020 is where shit really started getting weird. All of a sudden, NOBODY was buying food from us either. SO MANY PEOPLE were already getting food from Chewy that once they needed a prescription food, there was no way in hell they were gonna drive down to the vet once a month to buy a bag. They would ask for a prescription and put it on autoship on Chewy. 

So now chewy has OTC foods, supplements and products that used to be found only at the vet, and prescription foods. 

**BUT WAIT - THERES MORE.** 

In 2020, I have literally AT LEAST 50% of my clients ask "is this medication on chewy? is it cheaper?" and my answer is always a resounding "hell yeah it is" (idgaf if my hospital doesnt sell the product as long as the pet gets its medications - doesn't change my life one bit. I literally dont make any more or less money with where you get your meds). 

**Let me give you an example, something I deal with EVERY. FREAKIN. DAY.** 

I have a dog come in w/ a real bad skin infection. I suspect its cause of environmental allergies, but we gotta treat the skin infection first. I want to prescribe marbofloxacin which is an amazing, albeit expensive antibiotic. These numbers listed below are real numbers based on my hospital in Phoenix, AZ. 

* Exam fee = $59
* cone to keep from chewing = $12

I prescribe marbofloxacin for the infection and apoquel for the allergies. I also prescribe a prescription strength shampoo to help clear the infection and then a sulfate free shampoo for maintenance after the infection is cleared. Lastly I recommend an omega-3 supplement for long term skin care. The client says fuck you I'm gonna get this on chewy. Listed below are prices all taken from chewy. 

* Marbofloxacin 50mg tablets - 1 tab every 24 hours for 14 days (30 lb dog dose) = $52
* Douxo chlorhexidine shampoo to help clear the infection = $30 
* Douxo calm shampoo for long term help of allergies = $34.50 
* Apoquel 16mg tablets - 1/2 tab every 24 hours - 60 day supply = $73 dollars. 
* Welactin Omega 3 Supplement = $25 dollars

So do the math - **I spend an hour talking to this client for their dog and I make a measly $71.** 
For my 1 hour of work - **chewy makes $214.50** - AND THEY DIDNT DO SHIT. And $130 of those chewy purchases will be long term and for life (the shampoo, apoquel, and fish oil supplement). 

This is not a random scenario. This is something I deal with EVERY. DAY. I can give several more, literally. 

Chewy is destroying vet hospital margins - and as a vet I think the reckoning has been a long time coming. Some vet hospitals will go out of  business, and some will adapt with the times. I personally think playing both sides is the best route and it's what I plan to do. 

**COMPETITORS:**

1. Vet hospitals - I think that more forward thinking vet hospitals will adapt with the times. More and more vet hospitals are partnering with companies like VetsFirstChoice - online pharmacies that are connected with the hospital. These pharmacies allow me to put in the order for the patient's prescription products, the prices are significantly closer to Chewy's price, and it's way less effort on the client. The client now doesnt have to go on chewy.com -> order the medication -> wait for me to approve it -> wait for it to ship. Instead, I tell them we have this product in our online pharmacy and the price is the same as chewy. I order it for them and put in the directions, it automatically puts in their shipping info, and all the client has to do is check their email and pay. I think this will be a massive competitor due to convenience to the clients. Clients HATE having to wait for me to approve their medication requests from chewy (a process which will take at least 24 hours and clients are super entitled and throw a fit if they have to wait a day for anything). 

2. Walmart and Costco - Historically, these have been the largest competitors for pet medications. Over the last year, they have significantly beefed up the pet medications that they offer and their prices are ultra competitive with chewy. The benefits to these locations is clients can drive to a brick and mortar store and get their medications the same day. The biggest issue right now is low variety, they don't carry all of the pets needs (so clients will forsake the same day convenience in an effort to get everything from the same place), and currently I've been having a lot of issues with their customer service. The pharmacy techs will not know that those medications are not carried by walmart, and will tell the clients "we dont have it" when I know they do and clients get super pissed off by that obviously. 

3. Other pet medication suppliers - Things like heartlandvetsupply and 1-800-PetMeds. These have been around for YEARS and have never been able to make a dent, and now with otehr competition I don't think they will either. These are only found by very price savvy clients who don't mind extra effort to get meds and oftent it's not even much cheaper. 

**Price prediction:**
I cant give you a price prediction - I'm not experience enough to know what the price SHOULD be. But my point is that I think Chewy is still going to grow and I think it's a definite buy. 

**TL:DR - Chewy is here to stay, and I think it's a definite long term buy**

EDIT: Some really good points listed below. Everyone make sure to do your own DD and remember I’m just some guy on the internet  Specifically the counter points to my post who think I’m wrong make valid points to consider_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pay taxes on capital gains or reinvest? Due to circumstances I had to sell shares and realized a short term capital gain of $370,000 in Jan 2021 com. This is several years salary for myself! I have set the money aside for now and I believe it is not due until early 2022.

**My question is where is the best place to park this cash?**

I owe $136,900 in taxes. What if I were to reinvest $36,900 in stocks then in one year (Feb 2022), I would sell the stocks. If there is profit I would pay short term capital gains, take profits after deducting the original amount. Worst case it goes to $0 and I can deduct $36,900 from my capital gains. So now I am only taxed on $323,100\* in capital gains. Am I missing something? Sounds like a loophole the IRS would have closed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Corsair ($CRSR)   

***Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.***

For those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.

**Earnings. Tuesday February 9th**

First, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)

&#x200B;

**Q3 2020 Highlights**

\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year

\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year

\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year

\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)

\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year

\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year

\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**

**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year

**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**

\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”

\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”

&#x200B;

**Catalysts for Growth**

According to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),

\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.

**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.

**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020

\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.

\- According to Corsair

\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019

\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming

\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019

\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms

\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.

&#x200B;

**Market Share**

\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.

**- Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**

**-** Keyboards: 2nd

\- Mice: 3rd

\- Headsets: 4th

\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd

\- Performance Controllers: 2nd 

\- Memory: 1st 

\- Cases: 1st 

\- Power Supply Units: 1st 

\- Cooling Solutions: 1st 

**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well. 

\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).

These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale

\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals. 

\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.

&#x200B;

**Competitor Comparison**

**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech. 

\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.

\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million shares (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)


**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My first real buy-in I’m thinking about buying into corsair gaming (CRSR) right when market opens. Their earning report comes out Tuesday and technical analysis is looking like a bullish run could be coming soon, particularly if the earning is strong.

Apologies for the newbie question. I've found a way to download price data per stock via EOD Data. What I'm looking for is a free download list of the sectors and industries per symbol. EOD Data also has this, but it's behind a paywall. I wanted to ask if there was a free version out there that would have the same information.

Thinking of averaging up tomorrow. Thoughts? Basically I see alot of potential in novavax.  My personal belief is that covid wont go away and there will always be populations needing vaccination for the foreseeable future. I also think that pandemics and endemics may increase perhaps exponentially alongside population density (i have a biology background so these types of thoughts are not foreign to me). I think they will be selling covid 19 and nanoflu vaccines for years to come, i have no reason to doubt their impending fda/uk/india approval.  And I think they will be a useful company for many more viruses  perhaps that we dont even coexist with yet going forward. Im currently holding 10 shares at 200 a piece. I have more money freed up to invest now and thinking of grabbing more tomorrow regardless of open price. I know i could diversify and be smart. 

But im young and I see potential high gains coming for nvax. Im young and my dumbest riskiest decisions have always paid the highest.  But admittedly i dont know market analysis very well. Is it crazy to think nvax could be trading for 600 by end of year? 1000+ pre split by next? Or are these just simply unfathomable prices to reach for what they are? I mean they are breaking into indias market rn..... isnt that huge? 2 bn production capacity ? An fda approved superior quality safer for elderly flu shot that hasnt even reached production yet? Am i dreaming how perfect they seem for a gigantic explosion? 

Obviously i understand this stock is like top tier risky in many ways but i dont wanna think about the downside in this decision right now, as that will be negative catalyst produced and beyond my control. What i want to think about, is if their approvals go well and their sales start rolling out, what kinda of gains could be possible here? Essentially i know my downside is like 0$ but whats the upside? I feel like 650 a share within weeks of fda approval is not crazy.
It doesnt need deep refridgeration, is shown to be effective accross multiple strains and the companies propietary technology allows them to seemingly easily update vaccines to be more effective with mutations. I think they are easily top 3 vaccine winner.
If not #1.
Im not 100% in nvax but it is a huge chunk of my portfolio rn. But i wanna make it even bigger. I dont wanna look and see 20% gains on all my stock tickers a year from now and see the half i left in nvax is up to crazy amounts. I really feel like 2021 will see equal or bigger growth in nvax share price dollar for dollar(not % increase) to 2020. I know i missed the biggest takeoff but i think theres still so much momentum to be had
At 18 billion market cap theyd need to vaccinate just over 1 billion people to have revenue equal to their market cap, not even counting their impending nanoflu release, or anything else that them having a bunch of money now leads to them developing. I guess a simplified way to ask what im wondering, is if i think this company will be pulling 20 billion a year revenue within 3 years, what kinda market cap does revenue like that justify ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (possibly stupid) question about options Been reading up on the risks of selling uncovered options and I assume that doesn’t mean trading the contracts, but actually writing the contracts to be traded..right? Please correct me if I’m wrong. So how can you make a contract for stocks you don’t own? (Brain is fairly smooth)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I Use A Robo-Advisor? I'm new to the whole stocks things and was wondering if it would be in my best interest to invest with a robo-advisor? I don't think I know enough about stocks as of now to effectively manage them, so what would you suggest?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Not understanding some of the finer points of options: So I'm looking at options trading, and a little confused on how it works. Mostly because I'm a newbie investor who learns more based on practical application than by reading.   


So let me demonstrate what I think I understand, and maybe someone can fill in the gaps:

If I buy a Call option for $FAKE (currently trading at 2.50$), at that 2.50 strike price, I'm taking a bullish position because I want that stock price to go up, so I can exercise that option to buy those 100 shares and sell them immediately at the higher price (or hold them if I expect it to continue soaring). But any time before the expiration, I could, conceivably sell the call. I'm unclear on what that does. When i purchase the option, am I required to, if I sell the call, Am -I- required to fulfill the underlying contract? (Does selling a call option turn it into a covered call for which I must provide that 100 shares? Or am i merely passing off the option to exercise that call to someone else?)

&#x200B;

Puts are a little confusing for me, and despite how many things I've read about them i still don't -quite- grasp why i would do that. i get that it would require being bearish on the stock, and I follow that somehow as the price goes down that put option becomes worth more money. But the mechanics of it are lost on me. And as a practical type of person, if I can't look beneath the hood and grasp it, I'm not gonna turn the wrench, so to speak.   


I've also heard the calls/puts can be automatically exercised, and this feels like where some of the risk is, if i want to buy options but don't have the money to purchase the underlying stock (buying the options to sell to other speculators or people who want to get in at a good position.) So what are the ramifications of this?

Historically, traditional auto has traded at low P/E multiples:

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/13/electric-vehicle-revolution-is-it-really-different/

> The auto business has been a notoriously poor industry for long-term investors. Look back over a century, and automakers have gone boom and bust, with very few companies spared from the industry's volatility. Over time, there aren't many durable competitive advantages in mass-market vehicles, whether you're looking at styling, brands, or operational excellence, and margins are thin as a result.

> Add in volatility in auto volumes and you have a recipe for disaster for investors, which is why legacy automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Toyota all trade for price-to-sales ratios under one and often have P/E ratios in the single digits or teens.

A large U.S. pension recently made big changes in its investment portfolio.

State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio materially lifted investments in Alibaba Group Holding (ticker: BABA), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock, and halved an investment in Salesforce.com (CRM). STRS Ohio, as the pension is known, disclosed the trades in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

STRS Ohio, which managed $79.8 billion in assets as of June 30, 2020, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the investment changes.

The pension bought 136,700 more Alibaba American depositary receipts in the fourth quarter to end 2020 with 342,134 ADRs fo the Chinese internet giant.

Alibaba ADRs rose 9.7% in 2020, and so far in 2021, through Friday’s close, they have gained 14.2%. In comparison, the S&P 500 index gained 16.3% last year, and this year has risen 3.5%.
Alibaba ADRs tumbled in December when an affiliate was forced by Chinese regulators to scuttle an initial public offering. Alibaba founder Jack Ma also has kept a low profile aftercriticizing the state-owned bank system last fall.

STRS Ohio bought 248,974 additional shares of Lilly to end the year with 646,026 shares of the pharmaceutical giant.

LIlly stock rose 28.5% last year, and so far in 2021, it is up 19.5%.

Lilly reported a strong fourth quarter—boosted by government stockpiling of the company’s antibody treatment for Covid-19—at the end of January. Upbeat data on its experimental Alzheimer’s treatment has also bolstered Lilly stock. One observer thinks shares are still a buy, even with the recent appreciation.

Cisco stock slipped 6.7% in 2020, but so far in 2021 it has gained 7.4%.

Some on Wall Street think that networking giant Cisco will benefit from improved IT spending. Anyone pursuing the Dogs of the Dow strategy is aware that the high-yielding shares are in the doghouse. Cisco stock could rebound from 2020’s drop as growth resumes.

STRS Ohio bought 350,742 additional Cisco shares in the fourth quarter to raise its investment to 2.6 million shares.

The pension sold 363,451 Salesforce shares to end the quarter with 331,122 shares of the software firm.

Salesforce stock leaped 36.8% in 2020, and is up another 7.4% so far this year.

Some on Wall Street remain bullish on Salesforce stock, while others aren’t. Investors may feel that Salesforce is paying too much for Slack Technologies (WORK), which the company has agreed to acquire.

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

**2.4.2021 Prelude**:

If you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.

**Intro**

Man Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.

**Let’s begin**:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 
BB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.
BB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.

**Technical 2.4.2021**

On the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.

Surprises along the board.

**NEWS EVENTS**

FB settlement

BB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets

Someone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community
Videos on their YT

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.

The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.

After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.

If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.
As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.

Sony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5

BB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!

**Patents**

BB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

BB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.

**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.

Here is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.

**CONFERENCES**  

BB has just spoken at the following conferences:
Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.

Upcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance

**Conclusion**:

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

From here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll

Positions: 4k Shs, 20 jan 21 12.5C leaps_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMRN, case for long term hold * It's been a long and painful path to market success for Amarin.
* Legal roadblocks devastated the share price and brought generics to market much sooner than expected.
* The company has begun to rebound and has a new opportunity in the EU.
* Let's explore what the stock is worth.

Amarin (AMRN) is a biopharmaceutical company with a single drug, a refined eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 pill called Vascepa. Their stock price has been cut in half since March of 2020, but their growth potential in Europe and Asia, along with the possibility of maintaining a significant revenue stream in the United States, make this a unique value proposition in the biotech sector.

In 2020, the company delivered an estimated $618 Mil. in total revenue, almost all from sales of its medication in the United States. This represents an increase in revenue of 44% from 2019, although it fell short of the company's guided range of $650-700 million, attributable at least in part to fewer people visiting their doctors due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Final 2020 financial results are expected sometime in February, which will show exactly how close Amarin is to profitability. They ended 2019 with $644mil in cash, compared to $550 mil at the end of 2020, a net loss of just under $100 million.

Of note is the fact that Amarin now has no royalty overhang on any Vascepa sales going forward, the company has no debt, and their cash balance represents $1.40 per outstanding share.

New year brings new potential

At its just-concluded January meeting, the committee that makes recommendations to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave a positive endorsement for Amarin's drug Vascepa. The final approval from the EMA should come by the end of March, and the label should open the door to millions of potential patients.

The European Union represents the next frontier of Amarin's adventure, which has been a long and winding one with many stumbling blocks along the way. Dating back almost a decade, Amarin has found itself fighting for broad recognition and acceptance of its pure EPA drug.

Vascepa was first approved n the United States in 2012 for high triglycerides, and it received a substantial label expansion in Dec '19that authorized its use to reduce cardiovascular risk based on data from its landmark Reduce-it trial. There have been some victories along the way, but many setbacks as well, and Europe represents both an opportunity and a danger to the company in 2021.

Adding up the parts

Before we consider the possibilities that come with European marketing approval, let's try to break up the value of Amarin based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation. This may seem like a strange way to go about valuing a company that has only one product, but each territory of the world represents a very different opportunity and risk for the company, as well as different prospects for investors. It's important to evaluate what each region looks like now and in the coming decade in order to make a proper estimate for where the company and its stock should be valued.

Let's start with the United States, the only territory (outside a few small Middle Eastern countries) in which Amarin holds exclusive rights and has a currently marketed and established product. In 2020, Amarin did a little over $600 million in product revenue in the United States, an all-time high. That number comes with a caveat, however, and it's a big one vis-a-vis the recent introduction of a generic product into the market.

In November 2020, drugmaker Hikma launched the first generic version of Vascepa and immediately began making a dent in Amarin's prescription and revenue numbers. To date, the number of generic prescriptions has been relatively limited, but still significant enough to raise some eyebrows among Amarin's brass.

That led to a lawsuit claiming infringement of its broad FDA label for Vascepa, which is protected under the patents secured as a result of REDUCE-IT data, as opposed to their old (2012) label which specified an indication of high triglycerides over 500. Technically, the older indication should be the only one for which Hikma's generic drug is offered. If patients receive the generic for cardiovascular risk reduction, then Hikma risks infringement. Further, the lawsuit was recently expanded to include a health care insurance provider that Amarin claims knowingly violated the patents that protect the broader cardiovascular risk reduction label.

Back into court

The big question now is whether Amarin can successfully win its battle over patent infringement related to its REDUCE-IT cardiovascular indications. Amarin believes that the high triglyceride market is a rather limited one, and this is the only indication for which the generics can technically be prescribed. However, recent prescription numbers might suggest that Hikma has already had its generic version prescribed for the patent-protected indication, which could spell trouble for Hikma.

Investors are looking to a recent Teva / GlaxoSmithKline case where the big pharma successfully argued that the generic drugmaker had infringed on the broader label. Amarin may or may not refer to this case in its own lawsuit, but it certainly creates hope that Amarin could hold on to a significant portion of its U.S. market by limiting generic makers to a much smaller patient population.

All that is to say that it's actually unclear how big the U.S. market will become for Amarin. If it has already peaked with last year's $600 million in sales, then the value in the Unites States is rather limited long-term. However, if they can grow the overall market while keeping generics at bay, it's possible to bring in over a billion dollars a year in annual revenue in the United States, which makes Amarin's value much higher.

For now, I think it's fair to say that the shares are worth at least $5, or roughly $2 billion of market cap, based solely on the U.S. market, even with the risk of generic penetration. With success in their pending infringement lawsuit, that value could grow significantly. Recall that the share price reached $26 shortly after receiving the broad FDA label in 2019.

Don't forget the rest of the world

Outside of the United States, just to the north, Vascepa is also being sold by HLS Therapeutics in Canada. Amarin gets a standard royalty from these sales, which could total between 150 and 200 million dollars (US) per year in gross revenue, meaning that Amarin would be bringing in roughly 20 to 30 million dollars per year from royalties and potential milestone payments. I estimate Canada's value to the stock is somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.50 per share.

China is another market where Amarin is partnered, in this case with Eddingpharm, and of course the population of the country alone makes this a candidate for significant revenue. At the same time, China's health system is complicated, and revenue will be limited by the partnership agreement, which is similar to the one with HLS in terms of royalties, although it comes with additional milestones.

The expectation is that Vascepa will hit the Chinese market and be approved in 2022, and we will have a better idea of revenue within a couple of years. For now, I assign $2-$3 per share to the company's value for its agreement in China.

Next up is the European Union, where Amarin just received a positive recommendation from the CHMP for a label that would be slightly better than what they received from the U.S. FDA in 2019. For now, Amarin has exclusive European rights, although they acknowledge that it will take time to grow any market presence there. If they do go it alone without a partner, it would likely take several years to make substantial inroads in the Union.

For this reason, some investors have speculated that the entire company would be sold, perhaps to a European pharma, or that they would spin off the United States section of the company separately, or that they may partner out Europe as they did with China and Canada. Because of the uncertainty, it's also difficult to value Amarin's European potential. I would offer a broad range that values Amarin's European Union presence at somewhere between $5 and $10 per share.

Partnership or expansion possibilities also exist in territories such as Latin America, Japan, Korea, and other regions. For now, I will put a conservative valuation of $.50 on these additional territories.

Projecting the share price

Altogether, when you take these different parts, it's not simple to determine where Amarin should be valued or will be valued. A lot of these uncertainties have hung over the company for the past year, as its share price has gradually recovered from spring 2020 lows around $4 and now sits just below $8 per share. The range of values based on the above breakdown suggests a share price that should fall between a low of $14 and a high of $22.

I think there is long-term value to be had, even absent a buyout. I also think it's perfectly reasonable for shares of Amarin to trade between 10 and 12 once they receive European approval, and potentially more if they come up with a creative European partnership.

Investors who are hoping for buyout numbers of 10 to 20 billion dollars ($25-50 per share) are likely to be disappointed. When the stock price peaked above $25 following FDA approval of its broader label, that's very possibly the highest the company will ever be valued. Still, a buyout between $15 and $20 per share wouldn't be out of the question, and as I mentioned earlier, organic value and growth back to double digits is quite possible over the course of 2021.

There is one significant upside in all of this, and that's related to ongoing COVID-19 studies using Vascepa for its potential anti-inflammatory effects and other systemic benefits. Early indications are that Vascepa could be an effective therapeutic in treating people with COVID-19, helping to prevent some of the severe disease that's seen in patients who end up hospitalized. As more data comes out of these trials, potentially later this spring, a surge in share price could follow significant results there. I would not recommend Vascepa as a COVID-19 play if you're looking at biotech stocks purely from that angle, but there is potential there.

Could there be more trouble ahead?

The downside risks here are that generic drug makers continue to flood the market. In addition to Hikma, there are three other current applications to enter the market with a generic version of Vascepa in the United States. Those are from Dr. Reddy's, Teva , and private Canadian corporation Apotex. If any or all of these companies enter the market with their own versions of Vascepa later this year, it will make for an incredibly and remarkably divided omega-3 field.

Already taking up a significant market share is a generic version of the drug Lovaza, which despite having a much different mixture of fatty acids than Vascepa, and despite not showing the cardiovascular benefits that Vascepa did within trials, nevertheless maintains substantial revenue.

The benefits shown by the REDUCE-IT trial are not fully understood. Supporters of its success point to possible anti-inflammatory effects of Vascepa, as well as the fact that it is pure EPA, whereas other omega-3 drugs contain mixtures of EPA and DHA. Will cardiologists be convinced enough of the drug's efficacy to ramp up prescriptions?

Many of the company's question marks will be answered over the next 12 months, and they present a considerable overhang for the stock. But presumably, there is a reason that in addition to Amarin, four other drug makers want to be on the market with this product in the United States.

Conclusion

Based on its current share price, Amarin looks like an intriguing value proposition. While risks remain in the form of generic competition and a challenging launch of the drug in Europe, there are several valuable opportunities as well. Now we wait to see whether Amarin management can capitalize on those opportunities for the benefit of the company and its shareholders.

I’ve been reading about how ETFs work and I understand that fees are built into the funds. You will never see a charge to your account, but the fee is still there.

How does this work? 

Let’s say ETF is 50% $ABC and 50% $DEF and both trade at $10 per share. The ETF has a fee of 1%. 

The authorized participant (AP) gives the fund manager 100 shares of $ABC and 100 shares of $DEF in exchange for 100 shares of ETF. AP sells ETF on the open market. 

Those 100 shares and bought and sold on the open market until an authorized purchased goes back to the fund manager and redeems them for the underlying securities. 

One year later, $ABC and $DEF both trade at $11  per share. So the underlying securities are 10% higher. But because of the fee, ETF only trades at 9% higher. 

So if I had invested $1000 in this fund and sold after one year, I would have $1090.

When and how did the ETF manager collect their $10? Is it during the buy or sell transactions with authorized participants? 

I’ve tried googling this but the best answer I get is that ‘fees are built into the NAV’. I don’t understand how the fund manager can collect fees on something that is traded like a stock on the open market._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB SEC Form 4 The SEC form 4 filings show multiple insider tradings selling all of their shares on the run-up during the squeeze at around 12.50 to 13.00$.

let's assume a person makes a big profit in January 2021 on one of those WSB meme stocks of roughly 50k. For reasons of simplification, they would have to pay 15k in fed/state income tax on that by April 2022. The 35k will be reinvested.

Would the recommendation be to keep those 15k in cash in the checking account or just put it into something safe as SPY and sell in April 2022 when needed (with some extra profit perhaps, which would be long-term capital gains tax)?

Or what is your approach?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taxes vs. growth on gains this early in the year? Been following this sub for a little while. You all seem thoughtful and have vast knowledge and experience. Curious about your thoughts on this subject.

I’m fairly new to investing. Most of my holdings are long term plays like AAPL, MSFT, and CRM. As well as some ETFs and mutual funds (SPY, ICLN, FTEC).

Let’s say I sold for decent profit on one of my stocks I held for less than a year. I will owe short term gains for taxes 2021, which I won’t have to file for well over a year. I don’t plan on losing all that.

What’s the best way to capitalize on that decent chunk of taxes I’ll owe that is roughly $15k cash right now? Rather than have it sit in a low yield savings or park it in a CD. Obviously there are no guarantees on growth besides those two ultra safe options, but if I were to park it in something semi-sturdy like an ETF or mutual fund, would I then be able to pull the 2021 taxes owed around tax time next year and then new gains (now long term cap gains) from that will be owed for 2022? Rinse and repeat.

Again, I understand that there are no sure things so I must account for possible downturns.

Like many, I got into stocks because I wanted to make a lot of money. It took me about 2 years to really get the gain machine spitting out gains (2 years of mostly horizontal movement).

I started maxing out my Roth IRA contributions for 4 years and put in a total of $19,500 currently, I have turned it into $140,000 via swing trading shares and selling contracts (CC/CSP).

Sounds great. The only problem is, I’m playing in my Roth IRA. I’m not able to withdrawal any money and I never get to celebrate my wins with paying down debts I still owe, etc. 

So I’m currently in a state of feeling very successful, but at the same time, feel like I’m not making any progress. 

I guess I’m posting this to ask, do I seriously just continue trading and doing what I’ve been doing for another 30 years until I can withdrawal the money at age 59.5 and just try to accrue as much as possible over the next few decades?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If I put $100 in a stock, let it go up, and pull out $100, do I owe any taxes? Basically there are some stocks where I made some money and decided to pull out my initial capital and let the rest ride "free" for the long term. My thinking is 100 in 100 out = 0 tax even though it was a profitable trade, and then when I finally sell (most likely more than a year later) I'll only pay the long term capital tax.

Is this a correct way to think? If it's the case this seems like an amazing way to play short term trends with long term tax implications (in a good way)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Ford a good investment at this point?

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering the largest defense contractor in the United States; Lockheed Martin (LMT). This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so sorry in advance if it's dense.

**Business**

Lockheed Martin is a well-known federal defense contractor. Lockheed is responsible for some of the most storied and powerful fighter jets in the world such as the F-16, the C-130J Hercules, the F-35, and many more. They're also a very influential missile producer with offerings including the PAC-3 system, the THAAD System, the Javelin Missile, and the Hellfire Missile.

Lockheed gets 74% of its revenue comes from the US government, 25% of its revenue from international governments and 1% was from commercial and other customers.

Their operations can be broken up into 4 distinct segments: Aeronautics (40% of revenue), Rotary and Mission Systems (25% of revenue), Missiles & Fire Control (17% of revenue), and Space (18% of revenue). Let's take a closer look at these segments.

**Aeronautics**

This segment includes advanced military aircraft and unmanned drone production. This is probably Lockheed's most storied segment and is where a majority of people know them from. The F-35 program made up over 69% of the aeronautics segment's net sales in 2020 and is the crown jewel of Lockheed Martin's aerospace offerings. Production of the F-35 is expected to continue for a long time given the US government's inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft, commitments from 6 other international governments, and interest from other countries.

The drone part of this segment is very promising. Drone spending is expected to have a CAGR of 19.8% through 2023, and seeing as Lockheed is the largest drone producer in the US, they stand to benefit significantly.

In 2020, Lockheed Martin delivered 120 aircraft including 46 to international governments. This segment got 69% of its revenue from US government customers and 31% of its revenue from international governments.

**Missiles and Fire Control**

This segment provides air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, and ground precision strike weapons. Some of their famous offerings include the Patriot Advanced Capability system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. They also have some more cutting-edge (and expensive) offerings such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the Infrared Search and Track fire control system.

**Rotary and Mission Systems**

This segment provides commercial helicopters, surface ships, radar systems, cyber solutions, and simulation systems. This segment got 72% of its revenue from the US government, 25% came from international governments, and 3% came from commercial customers.

**Space**

This is the segment we know the least about as a lot of its operations are classified. The main customers of this segment are the US Air Force, the US Navy, and the National Guard. The US government accounted for 87% of revenues and the rest came from international customers.

This segment produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. One of the largest programs in this segment is the Trident II D5 Flett Ballistic Missle, the Space-Based Infrared System, and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. I can see massive tailwinds making this a very profitable segment.

**Revenues**

Lockheed brought in revenue of $65.398 Billion in 2020, a 9.34% gain YoY, a 30.88% gain from 3 years ago, and a 61.33% gain from 5 years. I think these numbers are absolutely staggering considering the performance of other Aerospace companies this year (Raytheon's revenue contracted 26.55% YoY and General Dynamic's revenue declined 3.62% YoY).

Switching over to COGS, we have COGS of $56.744 Billion in 2020, an 8.82% gain YoY, a 30.90% growth from 3 years ago, and a 57.49% growth from 5 years ago. While these increases may seem large, I'd argue that in the Aerospace industry, it's only natural that COGS growth will follow revenue growth. The only thing I'd want to see when it comes to this is revenue growth outpacing COGS growth which it has in Lockheed's case.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we see a 2020 total of $6.833 Billion, a 9.63% gain YoY and a 112.04% gain from 5 years ago (I left out 3-year growth because they had just spun-off a company meaning we get a growth rate of 248.46%).

**Margins**

Lockheed Martin currently has a net margin of 10.45%. Their net margin has expanded by 17.54% in the last 5 years. Comparing this margin to their peers, Raytheon is currently operating at a -5.55% net margin and General Dynamics is operating at an 8.35% margin.

**Cash On Hand/Debt**

Lockheed Martin currently has cash on hand of 3.16 Billion, representing an increase of over 108% YoY. The amount of cash they've stockpiled makes me think they may be gearing up for an acquisition, or (much more likely) continuing to pay done debt.

Speaking of debt, Lockheed Martin has been paying down debt significantly for the last 5 years. They've shrunken debt by 18.42% in the last 5 years and 13.64% in the last 3 years.

**Free Cash Flow**

Lockheed Martin has had a growing FCF for a while now. In the last 3 years, they've grown FCF by 21.09%, and grown it by 55.53% from 5 years ago.

**Dividends**

One of the most surprising things I found about Lockheed is its dividends. Lockheed currently pays a 2.99% annual dividend ($2.60 quarterly) that they've grown for 18 consecutive years. In the last 5 years, they've grown the dividend by 59.34% and maintain a payout ratio of 40.75%.

For me, the fact that they pay such a hefty and sustainable quarterly dividend was just an affirmation that Lockheed has been undervalued by the market.

**Price Ratios/Other**

Lockheed has a TTM PE of 13.24x. This compares well with the current average industrials PE of 107.38x. Considering the growth rates we've observed in the last 3-5 years, I feel like this is a pretty low PE, although I recognize the short-comings and general unreliability of the PE ratio when it comes to valuation.

What I find really interesting about Lockheed is just how efficient they are at generating capital. They have an ROE of **149.38%!** This number is even more insane when you consider their peers' ROEs. Raytheon has an ROE of -5.53%, General Dynamics has an ROE of 23.00% and Northrop Grumman has an ROE of 32.03%.

**Conclusion**

I'm really bullish on Lockheed. I think they've been undervalued by the market just because they're a member of a sector with some laggards. That being said, I would love to hear some second opinions as I'm not as experienced as many of you are._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it too late to buy Tesla?? Going back and forth as to whether or not it would be worth it to buy a Tesla share at this point. Currently saw what happened in the news a few days ago about how Tesla recalled many vehicles but, one main reason as to why I have high hopes for this company is the direction its going towards. Electric cars are the future and the fact that the sell solar panels too and just the overall heavy emphasis on being eco friendly is one reason as to why I'm keen on buying as many would agree that climate change is a big problem in today's world. One thing thats holding me back is the speculation that Tesla is simply overvalued and wouldn't be a smart play to hop on anymore.

It ups the premium, but it lowers your overall risk and therefore is a safer bet, even if you can't afford as many contracts with your premium, correct? The breakeven point is lower, so it is easier to profit with your smaller amount of contracts?

So buying higher strike prices are basically increased risk/rewards as far as you can afford more contracts for the same money? But the breakeven point is higher?

It seems like I do alot of research and read alot about stocks. There are so many stocks to pick from... how do you pick what stock you only have a few hundred to use?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding Institutional Ownership I've seen a myriad of posts on most major subreddits that talk about institutional ownership of a stock. 

Institutional ownership does not mean how much a hedge funds owns. It is the combined ownership of many different large institutions. This includes pensions such as CalPERS ($444B), Mutual funds ($20T) and exchange traded funds ($7.5T), hedge funds ($3T), college endowments (\~$150B in the top ten), and tons more of institutional players. The US stock market has a total market capitalization of only $50T which probably less then the value institutional money. There are plenty of other asset classes and derivatives to soak up more capital but that's not my point.

Looking at the institutional ownership of a stock to gauge hedge fund participation is like asking a 10yo about modern monetary theory. Sure they might point out something valuable like "they just keep printing money" but it really shouldn't be taken at face value and definitely shouldn't be used independently to make trading or investment decisions_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to decide when to buy a stock in a bull run? Since last year, majority of stocks are at 52 weeks high. Now I think the price which you pay is also very important  besides the company's fundamentals, as it then determines the ROI.

Their ability to execute and properly build the company culture determines the size."

At one point analysts believed AMZN was overvalued at a 30 bn market cap, TSLA at 80 bn, and SQ at 20 bn. Because they just looked at the balance sheet and not the CEO of the company.

I also think people are making the same mistake with LMND. People are scratching their heads, at the current valuation and why shorting the company doesn't work. Once again those people are overlooking the fact that LMND is in a 4 trillion dollar addressable market, and that they have an insanely ambitious and competent management team. 

**Proof that the management team has the ability to execute:**

So far Lemonade has high employee satisfaction, is ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for insurance, they already have a product that's arguably 10x better than the incumbent's (1/10 the time to process claims and onboard customers), they're achieving \~100% YoY growth, and they're currently releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months. 

When Daniel Schreiber said the biggest bottleneck to their growth is being very careful and selective on who they hire into the company, that pretty much sold me that they will most likely become a very valuable company in the future.

The CFO also mentioned that it only takes 2 years for a customer to pay for him/herself. After that it's purely profits. Furthermore when a customer goes through highly predictive life cycles and eventually graduates from renter's insurance to home insurance, the revenues generated from that customer 6X's. That means they can continue pouring money into marketing, and will also most likely be able to keep up their insane revenue growth rate going into the future even as customer acquisition slows down. 

I YOLO'd a good amount in LMND when it was at $60. It makes up 30% of my portfolio now. I'm still not going to sell a single share, unless Schreiber or any of the management team decides to quit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Overlap between Ark ETF’s?

This is a random question and since day trading isn't my style, I've never really thought about it much. I was wondering how day trading "rules" would apply in different situations, all based off having accounts with different brokers. For example :

1. If I had $5k in a RH account and $5k in a fidelity account, could I make 4 day trades in each account without being labeled as a pattern day trader? Or could I be labeled since I made 8 day trades total, even if two different accounts were used? 

2. If I had $20k in a RH account and $20k in a fidelity account, could I day trade since the total assets or cash is over $25k? Or does it have to be in one account only?

3. If I got labeled as a pattern day trader for making too many trades in my RH account, without having the required minimum, and that would result in that account being temporarily suspended, would I be able to trade with my fidelity account still?

4. If I had $35k in a RH account and $5k in a fidelity account, could I make day trades with the fidelity account, since I would have more than is needed with both accounts or would I get labeled since I don't have the minimum in the account the trades were made with? 

Are there any other ways having brokerage accounts with different companies could impact day trading abilities or limitations?

You uhhhhhh, wanna be a bit more specific/practical, rather then spouting the obvious._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think $TSLA will hit $1000 soon. So i’ve been following tesla for about a year now and I believe I have noticed a pattern good enough for me to share with the community. Please note that this is just a drawing with crayons and I could be completely wrong. 
Refer to https://m.imgur.com/6JNaHaW for my crude technical analysis. 
Basically any time the tesla stock trades sideways for 1-2 weeks, it proceeds to make a jump soon after. For the past year this has proven constant. It may have small dips and maybe a jump in there too, but it always follows this pattern. Following many investing firm price targets of anywhere from $900-$1000 it is not a question of if, but when it will hit that price. 
For the past 2 weeks, the stock has been trading sideways and not really gaining much in value. I believe that next week we will see the next big jump in value to at least $900, but hopefully $1000. I’m not here to discuss if that evaluation is actually realistic or if tesla is worthy of being more valuable than many car maker stocks combined, i’m just looking at the pattern it has been following. 

Positions: I have liquidated my stock positions for tesla for right now but I have a 3/5 847.5c
