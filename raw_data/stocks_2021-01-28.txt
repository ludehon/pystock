 AOC is our only lobbyist now!  

The MM probably hired an army of lobbyists to manipulate the decision-makers and people reporting to the white house, telling everybody that GME is going to cause another crash, and this is the last thing a new administration wants. They freaked out, and they probably approved what happened

&#x200B;

* **Are we harming the economy? NO.. We are building it.**

1. GME now has an inflated valuation .. yes. They will use it to expand and acquire smaller businesses and hire people.. Real economical progress
2. They can now pay their debts to creditors
3. Individual investors will use their profits to pay their credit card bills, buy a house, buy something.. The money is inside the market.
4. Individual investors from all over the world will use their profits to invest in other companies that will increase in value and expand.

* **We invest differently, They don't like it**

1. We are young passionate people with our own ideas. We don't share the same investment routine and style of older generations. We invest in a better future.. We invest in clean energy, Electric vehicles. We don't invest in shorting small business and crushing peoples dreams
2. We don't play by the wall street rules. We make our own research and our own analysis. we don't count on the analysis of biased analysts telling us how to invest. They are losing influence and that's why they are fighting us.
3. They benefit from our greed and we also were just benefiting from theirs. They have been making money out of the greed of some of us or sometimes the poor research we do regarding certain investments. We found their greed and we took advantage of it. We are actually doing SEC a favor by exposing the weaknesses of the system.
4. We don't need guidance on how to invest. We are mature people and we know the risk of what we are doing. They allowed retail investors to invest in companies with no products or employees.. some of these companies reached 55Bn in market cap.

# POWER TO THE PLAYERS!!!!!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it bad that I don't want to buy meme stocks? I started a stock account pretty recently and bought a bunch of safe, long term investments with the small money my dad gave me (not a loan of a million dollars btw, we ain't rich). I did buy some GME but I already sold it (before the shitshow today) and used that to buy some Disney stock. Is it better to play safe?

(no hate to the people who actually invested though, i applaud them for taking the risk)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Today is a dark day for traders It does not matter if you invested in GME, made money on NOK, or you are just interested in the stock market.

Today different brokers took down from MILLIONS of retail traders the opportunity to partecipate actively in the stock market to save some billionaires hedge funds.

In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

For few years in wich the possibility to partecipate was estended to a lot of retail users, and guess what happened? Most retail users (up to 80%) lost money having no idea what they were doing.

In the last few weeks GME has been the opportunity for normal people to take something back from the people controlling the market, and when they were finally succeeding, guess what?

They cut us out.

Context:

Everyone was saying tomorrow would be the day that GME explodes. Now it seems like people thinking are tomorrow AH or Monday instead now? 

I'm not worried about the few shares I own, but my 1/29 calls have me holding back panic attacks.

I'm feeling really depressed so please be at least civil._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Open three brokerage accounts. Mitigate counterparty risk. Today was a lesson in counterparty risk. 

When evaluating any investment I determine how much it is worth to me by evaluating three specific types of risks:

\-Idiosyncratic risk- factors specific to your security. For example, if the company performs well the stock should do well and if the company performs poorly the stock should do poorly) 

\-Systemic risk- factors that affect basically everything you could choose to invest in. For example, if the fed raises interest rates equity prices should fall which means that  even if the company you chose performed well it is still possible for you to take a loss.

\-Liquidity risk- if trade volumes grind to a halt for whatever reason you may need to \*pay\* more cash (ie. accept a lower price) when selling 

&#x200B;

It is important to note, however, that my ability to realize the value of my position is dependent on how I handle counterparty risk. Although it is infrequent, there is always the risk that my brokerage/bank/girlfriend won't perform as expected. One way I try to hedge that risk is by maintaining redundant brokerage accounts with multiple institutions. Going forward, I hope everyone else will do so as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Understand the gravity of the situation if you are going to buy the meme stocks and definitely do not play with what you can't afford to lose Building on what /u/juaggo_ has posted earlier. It is great that everyone is fighting the good fight and telling hedge funds to shove it, and I believe that this event will be impactful in the years to come.

That said, when you do buy, do it for the cause. Because you like the stock. **Because you want to expose how shit the system is**. Not cause you expect that you will make anything from this trade and that you will be able to pay of your tuition fees and home loans, or because you think that you are giving the middle finger to big money, because you are not. 

This is simply due to the sheer information and technology asymmetry.

Reddit's plan is in plain sight for all of the institutions to see. Long thesis tied to gamma and short squeeze on Friday, buy and hold and remove limits to avoid giving brokers information, "get out before the bubble bursts". Most new players are on platforms that they themselves understand less than institutional investors. It is hubris to assume that institutions with all their experience with manipulation and their PhDs that literally spend their entire lives studying specific topics, yes, even short interest and how it impacts the markets, will not have a counter strategy for the very obvious retail play. 

And the worst thing is that you do not know what it is; the price could be $1000 and back to $200 within minutes tomorrow if they so choose to ride the retail pump and dump, there could be no gamma squeeze at all as perhaps all of their shorts have already moved out in the dip to 100 today. What I am saying is that whatever happens tomorrow or the week after, the probability is very high that the institutions will still eat first, and the lucky initial buyers second, and the rest is likely going to be a dice roll.

On the other hand, I am going to make the sweeping assumption that most retail players have a surface level understanding on the strategies institutions are taking on this event. There has been a lot of focus on Melvin (almost a scapegoat at this point) and Citadel, but what about other players like Blackrock that are as strong and have unknown plans for the stock? Most will not understand the power dynamics between the organizations. One obvious example was Citadel snapping up Melvin in all of the chaos. Many other similar transactions are going on behind the scenes. Finally, they may underestimate the technology that they have at their disposal. People are paid millions to make their trades milliseconds faster, their codes a few percentage points more efficient - again, not resources your average investor has access to.

The bright spot is the media coverage has been very negative towards malpractices in the finance industry and there will surely be some sort of legal reform. If you are getting in this late in the game and are willing to ride or die, do it because you are bringing down RH and co., and because you are exposing more scummy practices to the world to see. Chances are you will lose the fight, but you will win the war._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trading ideas: GE, APHA, LYFT Some 30 percent of hedge funds are bullish about Lyft, the ride-sharing underdog that‚Äôs going public this week, according to a survey conducted last week of 40 hedge funds by Titan Invest, a portfolio investment app. But most of those are focused on how the stock will perform in the near term, not necessarily how well Lyft as a company will perform a few years from now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did Melvin close their positions during the dip to 120?

It seemed like a prime candidate for a breakout with great news and contracts being announced until shorts and squeezes took over the other day. Following some threads I've seen people saying it was a result of people pulling profits to essentially YOLO at surging tickers, 

A bit of background: 

* OEG works to convert decommissioned coal-fired powerplants to solar panel farms.
* Announced a joint venture with Akon Lighting America and Black Sunrise  worth approx. 750M US.

Great for traders (I hope), but for new investors, maybe it was confusing, emotional, stressful, all of the above.  Volatility is going to happen... maybe not quite the way this week played out, but it happens.  A few weeks ago I made a post about factors to consider when buying a stock from an investor's perspective.  I thought it would be helpful to talk about some of the intangible qualities that we should strive towards as well.

&#x200B;

1. **Humility**:  Being an investor requires humility.  It's hard not to compare yourselves to others, especially if you are on forums like reddit and you see people posting about gains.  **Do not compare yourself to others**.  Everyone's journey as an investor is different.  Everyone's perspectives are different, and we all have a different tolerance for risk.  We all have different life circumstances.  Some devote their day-to-day looking at stocks.  Others have to work consistent hours and days that prevent them from doing the same.  All that matters is that you are making decisions that you feel good about and that you are taking advantage of the markets in your own way.  Success in the markets should not be determined by those around you.  It's determined by the goals you set out for yourself.
2. **Discipline**: Emotions, emotions, emotions.  Every investor will tell you to take the emotions out of investing.  But it's so much easier said than done.  For newer investors, some of your earlier mistakes (like mine) will occur because of emotions.  When we see a stock shooting up, it's hard to fight the urge to join the hype.  Your emotions are telling you that you can easily double your money!  But, if you take the emotions out of the equation, would you have invested in the stock when considering your objective investing thesis?  It's important to create a plan and stick with it.  Your plan should be created based on industries you are familiar with or are willing to follow/learn more about.  **Stay away from buying stocks that do not fall under your realm of competence.  This includes your knowledge of the industry as well as your lack of understanding of why/how a stock is moving.**
3. **Patience**:  **Your journey as an investor is a marathon, not a sprint**.  Part of the beauty of investing is growing as a person.  You will see yourself becoming more well-rounded.  You will see yourself learning more about how the world works.  Don't worry about the day-to-day volatility, unless you see an incredible buying opportunity.  Always think big picture, both in terms of your outlook on the market as well as your personal growth.  In your 20, 30, 40+ years to go of investing, you will be encountered with thousands and thousands of opportunities.

Good luck everyone!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Honest question regarding current sqeeze and possible fallout What if the retail brokers will be forced by law/politics/general public to undo the restrictions on meme stocks. This would probably fuse the sqeeze to insane hights (correct me if I'm wrong). What happens if Melvin Capitol has to cover these shorts by selling off their positions and would probably need a big bailout (by Capital?) to prevent it from falling over. 

Eventhough Melvin Capital is only worth 20 bil in marketvalue which is merely a dent? A bailout would probably come by liquidation of market assests. Could this result in big down pressure on the market? 

Considering the discrepancy between the economy and the stockmarket and probably new lockdowns around the world as a result of Britisch Covid variant in combination with unexperienced retail money, could this be the catalyst to pop the market bubble?

Especially after this red market day._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Delta 9 (TSX $DN) ~5-8% short term opportunities **TL;DR**

**Delta 9 Cannabis** is a Canadian producer, cultivator and retailer. They have been trading on the TSX between $0.49 - $0.65 CAD over the last few months with a pattern of dips and rises in stock price of ~5-8%. The trade volume is relatively low. I have been buying in around $0.50 and seeing 5% returns in a few weeks, selling and waiting to buy the dip again. Prior to the pandemic. And since. In the Spring, the price dropped around the $0.40 mark. This isn't a huge play nor a long term buy. But its a quick 5% turn around. As of today, $DN is at $0.49.

**Background**
Delta 9 is one of Canada's oldest regulated grower. Prior to legalization, they held a growing license through Health Canada for Medical Cannabis in March 2014. These guys have been players in the game years before pot stocks were even on our radar. 

On December 4, 2019, Health Canada amended their Cannabis license to allow the Company to sell cannabis oils, extracts and derivative products in addition to the previously granted license for standard cultivation and license for sale for medical purposes. On February 16, 2018, the Manitoba government had awarded a license to legally retail recreational cannabis in the province to a consortium consisting of the Company and Canopy Growth Corporation. Recreational
cannabis was legalized on October 17, 2018.

**Current/Recent Production and Future Growth**
Like I said, I'm not touting this as a long term hold just yet. But its worth noting they look promising.

In Spring 2020. Delta 9 continued to invest inwards and increased its growing capacity to 25,000kg/year. (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/13/2015284/0/en/Delta-9-Receives-Approval-from-Health-Canada-for-Expansion-to-Processing-Area.html). 

Its market footprint is still relatively small compared to the other players in the game. Hence the stock price. 

**Phase II Expansion**

The Company is now working to expand its Health Canada licensed cannabis production perimeter to include additional buildings at its licensed production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba (the ‚ÄúDelta Facility‚Äù) which will bring the total licensed square footage to approximately 135,000 square feet, from 80,000 square feet currently licensed by Health Canada. The Company anticipates there will be no cost to this licensed area expansion

Of note, they paused the expansion when COVID hit to focus on their current production capabilities. 

Delta 9 received approval from Health Canada for sales of cannabis oil products. They have already completed production of several initial batches of its ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù and ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù lines of ingestible oils and will proceed with sales of these products in the medical and recreational use cannabis markets.

¬†
**Pre-Rolls**

In June this year they launched the ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù line of pre-rolled cannabis products, which consist of blended cannabis flower, rolled in a cigarette format, or ‚Äújoint‚Äù, for sale in the medical and recreational use cannabis markets. To date the Company has produced and sold over 75,000 cannabis pre-rolls.
¬†
‚ÄúIt is management‚Äôs belief that these products will become an increasingly important component of the medical and recreational use cannabis markets in the future.‚Äù said John Arbuthnot, Chief Executive Officer of Delta 9. ‚ÄúA continually expanding line of high-quality cannabis products is a major goal for the Company over this year and this is the first of what we hope are several milestones in our progress.‚Äù
¬†

**Products for Future Development**

Nanosphere Evolve Products
Delta 9 has acquired an exclusive license in Canada to manufacture and sell products made with the patented technology of Nanosphere Health Sciences Inc. (‚ÄúNanoSphere‚Äù) for the delivery of cannabinoids via nanoparticle technology. The two companies are in the process of developing the first product for Canada; an intraoral cannabis oil containing cannabinoid nanoparticles.
¬†
The NanoSphere delivery system for cannabis works by nano-encapsulating active ingredients in phospholipid membranes for transportation through the skin and mucosa into the bloodstream within minutes. Cannabis applications of the technology include transdermal viscous gels, intranasal products and intraoral products, all of which provide rapid results, precise dosages and high bioavailability. The NanoSphere delivery system of cannabis can eliminate the need for inhalation or ingestion of cannabis, offering users a potentially safer and more effective method of consumption.

¬†
**Dried Sift Cannabis**

The Company is currently developing its ‚ÄúSapphire‚Äù line of dried sift cannabis products for the recreational cannabis market which involves sifting the Company‚Äôs blended products and refining them, leaving more of the high potency resin glands and less of the low potency plant material. The final product is a yellow/brownish powder and has a potency that is up to triple that of the whole flower dried cannabis materials. The Company plans to release dried sift products in the recreational cannabis market in the third quarter of 2019. Management expects that retail pricing for these products will be up to $30 per gram.

My understanding of it is; bid and ask orders are submitted and ranked dependent on value and time placed in a way that benefits the buyers and sellers neutrally. So if some person puts in an insane ask price for a liquid stock, they probably aren't going to get that order filled because chances are, other people will be selling the stock at more reasonable values and have their requests filled.

Looking forward to hearing thoughts on these themes, other ways to play them and other themes._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Please be extremely careful with your holdings, especially meme stocks. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff going on that can go south any moment. I think that we can finally say that there is a pretty clear bubble, more or less in different  areas. The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?

Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven‚Äôt experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. 

While I‚Äôm really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers‚Äô asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we‚Äôre in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That‚Äôs just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.

I don‚Äôt like to be bearish, but I‚Äôd say that there‚Äôs a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.

Fundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we‚Äôre gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.

Because in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... 

...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.



The saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC & Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. 

And I‚Äôm fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.

People‚Äôs mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.

So all I‚Äôm asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they‚Äôre comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.

My investing strategy will focus on 2 types of stocks, value and growth.

I know value might mean different things to different people but to me when I say value I mean:

* A stock at a reasonable price
* A stock with good fundamentals
* A stock in an industry with staying power (Lindy)
* A stock within my circle of competence
* A stock paying a dividend (this is a bonus)

This has led me to look at utility companies, primarily electricity generation, as I think my circle of competence is focused on energy (with my background).

What I like about utility companies is the fact that I see no near future development that will allow the large user base to migrate away.

They provide an invaluable service that I think will stand the test of time (I know there is a possibility for homeowners to switch to solar and disconnect from the grid but the grid will always need to be there to service those that cannot).

The increase in electronic use the world over shows just how important electricity is and will remain, but I do not see much talk about it.

So I will be focusing on electric utilities that also have a focus on RE in their portfolio.

I am also looking at water utilities as well, and I think that is a bit more self-explanatory (unless we all start collecting rainwater). There are areas in the world that do not have available access to water and governments may not be in a position to fund development in that area, that is where private (listed) companies can step in.

The next component is growth stocks, and these could be in a number of different industry, trying to solve various problems. Industry disruptors that are more risky.

I am considering a 70:30 mix (70 being utilities).

  

Please let me know what you think, thanks.

Posted by u/dwarfboy1717 [1 day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/) **Friday 1/29/21 GME Expiry Date Means Nothing. Don't buy into the hype - shorts aren't just afraid of this Friday. Come down the rabbit hole with me.Discussion**üì∑

*Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.*

**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a "reasonable" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it's long term potential, and I think it's undervalued.**

**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.

**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (\~1 day) price movements\*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders.

Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can.

**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze.

However, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**

**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins.

**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality.

From that link above:

>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.

I believe.

However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under.

\*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some "normal" level, then they win.

Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way.

**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**

Here are some of my thoughts on $BILI (Bilibili) which is often described  as  chinese Youtube. However, BILI is a wider platform somewhat   differentiated from rest of the market.

**Introduction of the platform**

BILI is a platform including video on demand, live streaming, games and   educational content.

The  video part of BILI platform started  with content relating to anime,  gaming streams and other content  targeting gen Z (generation born  approx. 1996-2010). Although the amount  of content keeps growing  rapidly and videos which might interest older  people are included (like  documentaries), the average user age is still  21. Nevertheless, this  demographic group in China is large and will soon  represent the  majority of China‚Äôs online entertainment market. The  content is user  generated, licensed and also created by BILI itself.  Many popular anime  series and games are produced by BILI as their  original content.

BILI‚Äôs  live streaming part of the platform is very similar to Twitch.  Live  streaming content is mainly gaming and live chatting with popular   streamers.   Games are a big differentiator of BILI platform from   Youtube. BILI develops games and distributes games of other developers   on its platform. Gaming is the biggest revenue source amounting to 40%   of BILI‚Äôs revenue.

In   Q3/2020 BILI reported 197 million monthly active users and 53 million   daily active users (number of users growing at 54%, 42% respectively)   and 25 million monthly paying users (up 89% per year. The growth rate   seems very healthy and the numbers are even more impressive if we   consider that the average user spends 81 minutes a day on the platform.   This implies that the platform is very sticky and has good   recommendation algorithms.

**Monetization**

games 40%  
premium membership and live streaming 23%  
advertising 13%  
e-commerce and other 12%

The   portion of revenue from advertising is significantly lower compared to   Youtube which generates over 50% of revenue from advertising. BILI  faces  more competition than Youtube which has a strong dominant  position in  western countries. This might be a factor limiting BILI‚Äôs  ability to  force ads on users who might then switch to another  platform. However,  if BILI manages to differentiate and engage the  users enough to be able  to advertise to the same extent Youtube is  advertising the economics of  the platform would be excellent.

**Competition**

Tencent   video owned by Tencent ($TCEHY) is closer to Netflix with professional   series and movies being the most popular content. Tencent video   monetizes the content by advertising or by paid subscription which   enables users to remove all ads.

Youku is very similar to Tencent video and it is owned by the chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba ($BABA (Alibaba)).

Also iQiyi owned by Baidu ($BIDU (Baidu, Inc.)) is a subscription based original content streaming platform.

There   are also a number of short format video platforms like Douyin (chinese   version of TikTok) and Kuaishou who might partially compete for the  same  users as BILI.

**Prospects**

The   company is showing consistent execution of growth strategy offering   diversified entertainment content. The platform seems to be   differentiated enough to thrive despite strong competition in video   streaming. If BILI is able to maintain this growth for some time and   then achieve more organic growth and lower marketing expenses, the   economic outlook seems very promising.  Risks Big part of the expenses   of the company is for advertising of the platform. That is natural as   growing the user base is a priority. The spending however doubled in   Q3/2020. One thing to keep in mind is that if BILI is paying high   customer acquisition costs while the demographic profile of users is   rather narrow (average age 21) the users might not stay on the platform   as they get older and therefore the return on the acquisition cost  might  be low.

**Valuation**

The   current market cap of 42 bn is roughly 14 times sales if we take sales   from Q3/2020. That does not seem too much in the current environment  of  high multiples. However, the revenue of 3.2 bn in Q3/2020 resulted  in  loss of 1.1 bn. Conservative projection of revenue growth. During  the  past 4 years revenue grew at roughly 90% compounded annual growth  rate  (CAGR). From Q3/2019 to Q3/2020 it grew by little over 70%. As the   company is getting bigger, the law of big numbers will likely make the   growth slower. If we take 40% as CAGR for the next 3 years, we can   project sales in Q3/2023 to be equivalent of 35 bn a year. That would   make current market cap 1.2 times those sales which does not seem   expensive.

Can an experienced trader explain to me why the stockmarket fell the last few days? I am pretty new to these things and wanted to learn in this situation. 
There are 3 possibilities I can think of. 
1. GME went up and people sold their old positions to go into gamestop, which made all other stocks sink.
2. A lot of hedge funds are losing a lot of money because of GME and people are panicking because they don't trust the stock market anymore. So they sell and keep the money in their pocket. 
3. There is a major correction, because the last few months only went up. 

Is my thinking process right? Is the phenomenon right now so bizarre that nobody can explain it?

So I just wanted an explanation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is Ortex freefloat on loan SO different from Yahoo finance for VWM? 116% vs 14%. What am I missing? I was looking through Ortex to see if any other stocks might end up as highly shorted as GME when the Jan 15th exchange SI numbers got published and came across VMW. Ortex lists their % Freefloat on Loan as 116%. It's likely based on their "Estimated" SI, which is about 18% higher than the exchange reported SI from Jan 15th. But the Yahoo Finance "Short % of Float (Jan 15, 2021)" is only 13.90%! The 18% higher SI estimate is not enough to make up this difference! What am I missing?

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet:

Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme)

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally.

A company‚Äôs outstanding shares is 150M, but a portion shares is restricted to investment banks, mutual funds, etc. Therefore, the float is 100M, so 100M is available to the public to buy/short. However, let‚Äôs say the short float is 50%, so there is 50M shares to buy/short. I understand how the short float % can exceed both the float & outstanding shares because ‚Äúborrowing shares is synthetic,‚Äù but I also can‚Äôt grasp this because I thought the shares available to short was a finite number. Eventually the borrowing fees get so high nobody wants to short it or the brokerage denies it. Also, if 50M is available to buy/short, how will know or find out how many of those shares are being held by retail investors. I know a website that displays fees and shares left to borrow already. Is there a statistic i‚Äôm missing? Am I stupid?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME- Why GME may crash Friday due to Delta Hedging, but the show may not be over yet * Well, \[call\] options are the key factor why retail traders have truly been able to accomplish what they have thus far due to the levered nature of options and the delta hedging market makers must perform to control risk.

Before this new age of crazy retail money in the derivatives markets, retail traders‚Äô capital was never significant enough to make big price changes, and, for the most part retail was always taken advantage of as a bag holder.

Now, with such intense call buying atm and OTM, market makers must control their delta by buying equivalent lots of shares. As most atm calls have a 50 delta, and further OTM have a smaller delta (limit to 0 in theory) , as the price started to explode, the gamma ( rate of change in delta) started flying, which causes market makers to rush to hedge their delta by being long more shares more quickly ( accelerating risk covering). This concept, especially against deadly high short interest, makes a pack of retail traders fairy deleterious. While maybe $1 billion in 1999 trying to fight against the suits could barely tip the needle, that same $1 billion today with a great majority in calls has amplified exposure tens of times, changing the playing field to cause significant damage.

So what happens next and why is Friday so important?

Since a great deal of call options are well into the money, brokerages are now expecting traders to exercise their options or sell their positions to be exercised else-wise. Since the 29th is a massive day for option expirations, millions of people are looking to cash in and dump shares / exercise to profit.

However, many of these traders do not have the capital required to actually open a position. This causes a huge problem because now all of those traders with options will A) be sold back to the MM who will immediately sell/ adjust their net delta to the downside to protect their risk exposure OR immediately exercise and sell their shares to avoid margin calls/ interest.

Not only does the take away of millions of option contracts and the exercise of such add a massive supply of shares to the market ( to be sold) it also forces dealers to sell shares to reduce their exposure they were forced to originally buy to hedge their delta from the calls. So, in theory the opposite of what happened on the way up can happen on the way down, but this time as dealers unload their shares forcibly to control their delta, shorts will also tack on to add pressure on the way down, also short selling shares to create a massive sell off.

Ultimately, everyone should be very careful and pay great attention to what happens this Friday. On the bright side, once the sell off happens, as short interest picks up again, the opportunity to buy and squeeze may present itself once again.

TLDR; Be careful of GME on Friday, delta hedging downward will happen as people unload from calls.

I was hoping to verify my understanding of opening and closing puts on a stock, without actually owning any of the stock itself. My understanding is that I can buy open a put on a stock, picking an option date in the future at which I hope the price of the underlying stock drops enough such that the put option gains in value. For that option, I pay a premium of some sort.

What I want to verify is that my total exposure on buying open a put like this is *just* the premium I paid. If I am lucky, the stock drops and more people purchase the option, raising its price and allowing me to sell it closed later and make whatever additional value it has collected. If I am unlucky, the underlying stock never goes low enough to bring the put into the money... but I don‚Äôt have unlimited exposure as I might do if I owned the stock and sold it short.

Well, first off, let‚Äôs look at what exactly Intel Corporation is. 
Intel Corporation designs, manufactures, and sells essential technologies for the cloud, smart, and connected devices for retail, industrial, and consumer uses worldwide. The company operates through DCG, IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, PSG, CCG, and All Other segments. It offers platform products, such as central processing units and chipsets, and system-on-chip and multichip packages; and non-platform or adjacent products comprising accelerators, boards and systems, connectivity products, and memory and storage products. The company also provides Internet of Things products, including high-performance compute solutions for targeted verticals and embedded applications; and computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, data analysis, localization, mapping, and driving policy technology. It serves original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and cloud service providers.

We all know technology isn‚Äôt going anywhere, any time soon. It‚Äôs actually just going to keep getting bigger. 

$INTC shows a very strong balance sheet. In fact, even during a worldwide crisis, Intel still found a way to beat expectations. Intel generated $77.9B revenue. That‚Äôs an 8% increase year-to-year.  On top of that, the company generated $35.4B in cash from operations and $21.1B of it is was free cash flow. And they‚Äôre not done yet.

However, the thesis of my post is literally "we should open up to everyone, so anyone can learn the basic facts of investing, because then people can make more educated decisions", which is distinctly *not* WSB style apparently. So let me elaborate on why I think popularity is good, not bad, and how that makes *other* stocks squeezeable. 

# Fact 1: Many people don't know the basic facts

(How "many" is defined is unclear, but given the amount of complaining about questions on this, and the number of people who have exactly 0 investing experience, I think this is self-evident).

People have been calling GME a bubble, or a pump and dump, since 1000% ago. Now, while it is a bubble in the sense that it's going to go up and then crash, it is *not* a pump and dump, but an entirely legal short squeeze.

I'm going to explain the basics, so **feel free to skip ahead** if you know them already, but here's the long and short of it. GME has had [well over 100% short:float ratio](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) for quite some time. We noticed, and due to general hype around Ryan Cohen (who successfully turned around Chewy, a pet food company) among other things, the stock price started going up.

However, that was *not* the short squeeze. That was just good ol' crowd behavior - as the stock goes up, people start buying, and when people start buying, the stock goes up. Normally this is pretty well controlled. However, around $40/share, people noticed something - Citron Research [tweeted](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1351544479547760642) that GME was going to crash back to $20/share, and then, within minutes, a massive sell went through in the market. The price began to drop.

From WSB's perspective, this was two things: One, blatant and unfair market manipulation, and two, a perfect opportunity to "buy the dip". After all, if they kept buying, the price would go back up, Citron would be shown wrong, and they could squeeze out the bad guys. And, enough people agreed (or at least saw the price go back up) that the price *did* go back up. And then some.

Now here's what people got wrong, and still get wrong: The price started skyrocketing because of a squeeze, yes, but a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. The short explanation is basically, when calls expire in the money, you get stocks from whoever wrote the contract (who has to buy them if they haven't already), and when stocks are up, more calls expire in the money. More stocks have to be bought = stocks are up = more stocks have to be bought. Technically this doesn't *all* happen on Friday when the calls expire, but rather the effect gets diffused throughout the option chain, and the measurement of how fast it's going up is gamma, which is why it's called a gamma squeeze.

I don't know *how* many times I've seen people mislabel the various spikes as a short squeeze, or even ignore that aspect entirely and just call it mob mentality. The numbers on the shorts are mostly public knowledge, and yet, *even in this sub* you get tons of people asking "has the short squeeze happened yet?" or even asserting that it has.

Furthermore, the basic squeeze tactics - exercising options at expiration, not buying then selling, stop-loss hunts, etc are similarly, horribly underrepresented.

# Fact 2: The more the merrier

Now, here's a fact that everyone knows - the more people get in on a short squeeze, the higher it goes. As more people buy in and hold, the price skyrockets higher with less opportunity to exit short positions, so those holding short positions are forced further into the red. Notably this is *great* for everyone in on the squeeze, even those who get in relatively late - as long as it's not during the squeeze itself, which is driven by short sellers buying rather than normal buying, everyone makes more money.

# Conclusion: Spread the info

*This* is why I'm so salty WSB went private. It's absolutely the worst possible move. With the momentum the movement in general has, we could easily make more and more people aware of these basic facts. If people watched r/stocks anything like they watched r/sports, even half as much, there'd be triple the number of people invested. At 1/2 the subs, that'd still be quadruple the current sub count - even by a [month old estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) WSB had 6% of the stock, so even being conservative on every part of this back-of-the-envelope calculation this could easily be 20%. If you really believe in reddit swaying the market, imagine quadrupling that sway - even in less optimal conditions, is it crazy to believe it'd reach a modest percentage of GME's success?

# Actual Recommendations

Here's the thing - I'm not that smart. But you can easily verify that a lot of the "GME is a one-time opportunity" people are full of it. A common claim is that there's not that much hedge fund investment in shorted stocks so you're just fighting other individuals, or that there's not enough shorting to squeeze, but that's easily checked: take a look at [this list of shorted stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092), and see, for example, [LGND](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lgnd). At 40% hedge fund ownership it's similar to gamestop, and at 65% shorted float you can bet *some* of that spike is going to hit the funds. It's also got an incredibly high put-to-call ratio, which has similar effects. Similarly [DDS](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/dds) has 91% float shorting, and still 17% hedge fund ownership. 

TL;DR don't crack down too hard on newbies, get DD to the front page, and there could very well be another GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What can Gamestop do right now? Gamestop stock is soaring as everyone know. They‚Äôve been incredibly quiet over the past while. Blackberry even commented on their own rise a couple days ago. But Gamestop has been radio silent.

Let‚Äôs say Gamestop wanted to take advantage of this situation. What would be things they would be doing right now? Would diluting shares play into the shorts hand to cover and bring down the price? Could they be doing a covert stock buy back to choke off the shares? Or maybe another big player has been buying shares or options to make big bucks on the squeeze? I would imagine doing something to get the shorts off their back would stave off bankruptcy.

These questions have been swirling in my mind the whole day. Investing for nearly 20 years now (dam that makes me seem old) and if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned is that the market is way too complex for someone not in the industry to truly grasp._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APPS Digital turbine is a mobile advertising platform that preinstalls ads on android phones.

Good day all, 

Wow what a day we had...!!! Congrats all! I have been reading for what could be a good potential candidate for squeeze.

Here is a few things to note:

- AXDX  has low count of shares outstanding 57,000,000 approx.
- short interest is 13,700,000 in total
- days to cover that short in current aggregate volume could be 43 days ( of course that will be shorten when fire will catch in the stock)
-the most interesting is 42% of the float is short.

Important fact to know also:
- there is options on the stock... volume have started to spike significantly in last few days
- volume has increase but not in a way that make stock expensive ( anyway do we know what expensive means theses days! ?? Lol)

What‚Äôs does this all means... it means... to squeeze the stock does not require as much efforts and capital than gme or any other super large big cap...

For the stock to be stock ( by pro) it means the stock ramp up significantly faster than anything else, therefore making the pain of the short seller quite acute.

And since options are available... the leverage is like... unbelievable!

Run the maths... today‚Äôs volume on gme was 90.000.000 shares at 347$. This 31 billions$ of shares traded... now apply this for one day of just a week to a stock that begins his ramp up at less than a 1 billion total value!!!!! 

I don‚Äôt know it just make sense to me. If guys want to see 1000$ stocks... you need few ingredients, theses are some of the few.

Have a great evening_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will the entire stock market be affected due to so many people buying GME and AMC? I see too many beginner novice traders wanting to hop on the trend of buying shares of AMC GME and NOK. I see too many clueless people opening up investment accounts completely clueless of how the market works taking advice from Twitter,Tik Tok, reddit and most of these people are getting advice from kids who haven‚Äôt even been in the market long. From my standpoint I understand how many people could make quick money but I feel like a lot of people are going to lose a lot. From an investment standpoint GameStop is a dying industry due to mostly games now being purchased via online and they have closed half of there stores across the country and have been limiting employment. As for AMC they lost of 900 million and before covid are 6 billion in dept. I just hate to see so many people listening to other clueless people instead of doing there own research. But my main question is wondering how big of an impact this is on the rest of the market? What are my fellow redditors opinions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions on $UXIN? Chinese Carvana; the ONLY listed player; underdog turnaround story; boost expected from upcoming policies and potential equity financing. And mkt cap is small enough to fly. Wanted to see y‚Äôall opinions on this one $UXIN, it has been on my watch list for quite some time now, recently some YouTube bloggers posted some videos on it and I noticed it‚Äôs starting to draw some attention. Basically it‚Äôs the Carvana of China, the only listed Chinese used car platform play. The stock has tanked since IPO. Did some extensive DDs on it to find out what happened - was a typical unicorn a few years ago with strong PE lineups behind it but a few of its competitors were burning cash like cray to get market share, the company jumped into the game and was stuck with this toxic model for a couple years, even hired DiCaprio to do ads for them. So at this rate of cash burning it wasn‚Äôt able to generate profits and prove its biz model. Like its competitors they just expanded to different used car related verticals and kept operating at high expenses. The situation was worsened by its venture into the auto financing space and unlike the amazing auto loan/title loan track records in the States basically the auto loans delinquency ratios etc. was looking really bad in China , so they had to basically sell off their auto financing biz to prevent the credit risks and sold offline biz as well. COVID just made it way worse in 2020, so the company was having a tough time. 

Now the company is pure-play online platform and started building its own inventory, I think it‚Äôs got all the  great potentials:

1. Similar underdog story but it‚Äôs converted to a pure-play online platform biz model now, company‚Äôs small market cap, small enough and pure-play enough to be heavily impacted by any improvements in sales pickup, news of financing, policy impacts etc. 
2. Chinese used cars market is currently a mess cuz of lack of standards, transaction transparency, consumer protection etc. Seems like supportive policies on their way, the government is working on ‚Äòem right now and from the news articles I personally expect these policies to come out in 1H 2021. Bloomberg also has an article talking about China is intending on boosting and double the value of secondhand vehicle sales by 2025. And as the only Chinese used cars platform listed in the US I expect Uxin to be the winner when relevant news substantiate. 
3. It doesn‚Äôt have much cash left so I think to sustain its operations for this year and the next it must be on its way of securing some additional equity financings, and particular news on this aspect I believe will boost the company significantly. Currently it‚Äôs still got all star lineup as shareholders including Warburg Pincus and Singaporean sovereign GIC in it. Just don‚Äôt see much possibility of a total wreckage and I think both fundamental and trading-wise it‚Äôs floored already, risk-reward just looking retardedly nice. 
4. Technical-wise looking good, classic cup n handle forming and just need some sparkle to boost it uppp. 
5. COVID definitely impacted its biz in 2020 but mgmt gave pretty good guidance, expect the sales figures to have bottomed and start picking up steam in 2021.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending (like spotting those üöÄüöÄ).

As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not, or to use some automated brokerages like [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) with algo-investor models based on these sentiment analyses. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

As many of you know COVID has crippled our economy and caused a lot of people to struggle with finances and more....idk about all you guys but I‚Äôm ready to get back to having fun doing all the things I used to do! The COVID market on wall street has been killing it but we seem to have nothing but a couple vaccines out there that may or may not work. I‚Äôve been super invested into researching all these company‚Äôs that are working on vaccines and treatments but most seem like dead ends or it‚Äôs big pharma and the elites controlling all this BS...but I think I really found something and I want to spread it out there since nobody else wants to! It‚Äôs innovation pharmaceuticals or IPIX on the ticker read about there COVID drug bracilidin I think that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs spelled but this thing could be the future to treating this stuff finally not only that is it will stick it to the big guys because this drug works on damn near anything, I‚Äôve had some inside info from other medical and military professionals and they want this stuff because of all the studies, sadly big pharma and shorts have kept this stock low and news just don‚Äôt get out unless they are a big company or making huge gains on Wall Street. Just thought I‚Äôd share this with you guys on this thread because whats going on with GameStop is amazing and all the people really sticking it to these hedge fund billionaires and making money seeing stories or people paying for surgeries and all this is mind blowing I love it! But anyways don‚Äôt take my word on IPIX do your research and see for yourself I‚Äôm really to get back to every day ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life.

I‚Äôve shared the data with people who are in the cancer treatment field. Every time the reaction is the same: ‚ÄúHoly crap. This is a game changer!‚Äù

It was such a game changer, Johnson and Johnson partnered with Geron. 

It turned out to be such a game changer, Johnson and Johnson ended their partnership. Not because it wasn‚Äôt a phenomenal product but because it would replace several drugs in their pipeline and would negatively affect their bottom line. 

Since then the shorts have eaten this stock alive. They don‚Äôt care that this can save countless lives. All that matters to them is that they make a few bucks. 

I‚Äôm not asking you to consider investing in this stock to make a profit (although with the proper support, it can happen). I‚Äôm asking you to consider investing to defeat the corporate evil and give this company/drug a chance to change the world for the better. We all talk about defeating cancer. Let‚Äôs support a product that actually can!

Please consider supporting Geron and passing this message on to those who can make a difference.

Anything helps!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on researching Fidelity "undervalued stocks," $CI for example. Hi, I'm new to this and want to get better at research.  I figure the best way is to ask questions.
If you go to Fidelity stock research site, you can see the most undervalued stocks, according to them. Looking more closely at one of these stocks, like Cigna, I see many indicators that it would be good to buy. For example the equity summary score is very high. Additionally the firm opinions are almost unanimously "buy.". The return on assets return on equity and revenue growth same high as well.
It seems to my newbie brain that this is an easy pick, although deep down I know it is more complicated than this or everyone would quickly do this research and buy in.

I am making this post for some feedback and criticism on my feelings on the market's situation right now.  

The stock market today has never seen anything like this before. $GME $AMC, and $NOK have all threw the odds out the window.  GME and AMC both rose extreme amounts today and even taking around 80 billion from hedge funds.  I am experiencing some FOMO from all of this, but I am not angry or mad at anyone for making any money.  

New users to free brokerage apps flooded today, and most people don't even know how to fundamentally value a stock, which is the first thing you should do when buying into a company and is relatively easy.  These massive amounts of people do not know what they are getting into, and I just feel like when you put this much time into researching and learning about stocks and for all of that to be thrown out of the window, it is very hard to process.  I wish I got in on it, but **I wanted to see people's thoughts on the new era of investors.** 

I also wanted to know peoples thoughts on NOK for tomorrow, 

P.S. Just bought 50 shares of it_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NASDAQ peak ! Monetary Physics hypothesis on why this downdraft is not just one bad day  

The NASDAQ peaked and is on a downdraft. There is actually a monetary physics explanation.

The Mises Institute reported at mises\[dot\]org

an unprecedented increase in the money supply (as it has for much of the year) of +37.08% year over year. All of this newly printed money is part of the stimulus this year that started in March as you know. It was not supported by a tax base. If you look at the last peak in the NASDAQ before this latest Big Print started, it was at about 9800 in mid Feb 2020.

So to see the NASDAQ grew in proportion to the money supply increase:

9800 x 1.3708 = 13,434

The NASDAQ yesterday closed at 13,626 and indeed spent only 2 days at that level before it ran out of gas and fell today to 13,271.

One can note that Mondays have been positive in January because those receiving stimulus checks this month typically used the weekend to think about what mutual fund they wanted, and placed the order to happen Monday. I would think the majority of that money has been played out since I got my paper stim check 20 days ago.

Therefore this hypothesis says that the NASDAQ has not just gone down on a singular bad day, but has peaked.

What else? Unemployment is the worst since 1967, before personal computers.

All stocks market cap to GDP is 130% to 180% depending on which guage you see at gurufocus\[dot\]com

this Buffet Indicator is higher than it has ever been, well above even winter of year 2000's stock peak.

The Schiller PE at 34.10 is higher than it was on Black Tuesday 1929, as seen at multpl\[dot\]com. It was only higher in 1998 and 1999 when at least the employment situation was good.

So monetary physics shows that there is no more gas in the tank for it to go back up to the point where buying to try to get a percent or two would be profitable, and that there is no fundamental reason for the market to do anything but drop farther in the next few weeks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Places to get Data Hi All,

I am new to stocks, as there appears to be a lot of new people in stocks this year with the pandemic, and all this GME etc going on. I have not bought any of those meme stocks as I am more looking to get really good at stocks and really understand them for the long term.

I am wondering, when you all do your due diligence, what websites do you use for your data? I am trying to find a quick, but efficient way to do my due diligence, and I also want to be able to put this data on excel. I want to be able to get 5 years of data on a company.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: thanks for all the help!! Just to clarify, by data I specifically mean numbers. So like spreadsheets, or tables, with quarterly earnings, p/e ratios etc. That I can easily pull into a spread sheet. Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ant owning gamestop. Gme I believe the purpose of the rally for gme is great which aims to take a stance against those corporate market manipulators who instill fear in people by shorting non-existence shares and profiting from them. 
I got in on 350 believing holding it would benefit our collective interest of ants that can profit from the mm. If we succeed, which i am uncertain when it would happen, then we would profit from the mm. However if we fail, then it becomes a competition between ant shareholders to see who would get out faster. For people who bought high, the dmg would be severe. But for those who bought low and has accumulated significant gain has not much to lose. There has been a movement of ants dispersing to other tickers like nokia, amc, express, naked, and koss. 
What i dont get is why would people disperse instead of focusing on gme solely? If it is correct there are 140% of shares that are shorted and the remaining volume of shares would reduce that can force mm‚Äôs hands.

GME is currently at a short interest of like 138% and 72 million shares. So people (hedge-funds) borrowed millions of shares of GME to (they hoped) buy at a lower price because they were convinced the price would drop. 

Now all of these people who shorted GME will get margin called and/or have to buy the shares at market price, but if people don‚Äôt sell their GME shares, the price will go higher and higher and higher because those shorters HAVE to buy? 

Is this correct? Am I missing something or can someone fill in any gaps in my understanding? 

So essentially GME can potentially just keep going up because 72 million shares are going to have to be bought at the market price and therefore it‚Äôs not too late to get into GME?

There are spammers and bots, things are a mess, but the community needs to be able to talk about what they think is going on. I was not the one who set it to private but I made it clear that other mods do have authority. Let's look at this phase as the subreddit going through a rough patch. We will get through, but things probably won't look the same to mods or users until the admins get a handle on what is going on. If the community has tips about what they see happening, please let us know, but it will take time to respond to legitimate complaints and concerns. 

I haven't seen anything like this before. Please don't ask us to fix things immediately by blanket bans of tickers. If we close subreddits due to bots, that in and of itself could be considered capitulation or a lack of neutrality. Please do sort by top/week if you want to see something that looks more normal. Please understand that we are a little overwhelmed, but it's okay to be overwhelmed sometimes. We will figure this out, but we aren't going to change everything immediately because of the events of one day.

So just like everyone else, I‚Äôve been seeing this hype/meme with GME and AMC and so I tried to buy 2 shares of AMC on my account but it‚Äôll reject it saying what I put in his too high or low or something along those lines. I‚Äôve tried 4 different numbers, all of them seem within range of what I‚Äôm seeing in asking price and lowest etc. I‚Äôve never bought a stock before I‚Äôm completely new. Anything helps._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
