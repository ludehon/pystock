 Drone Delivery Canada * $TAKOF * DD [10X UPSIDE] Drone Delivery Canada Corp. is a drone technology company focused on the design, development, and implementation of its proprietary logistics software platform, using drones. The Company’s platform will be used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for government and corporate organizations globally

&#x200B;

Drone tech is really hot sector right now and I feel this is immensely under valued. I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.

&#x200B;

* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT
* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.
* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!
* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time
* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.
* Currently trading around $1.1
* Todays volume has been a record.
* $0 DEBT!
* $20 million dollars in the bank.
* WSS has a price target of $6.5
* Undervalued 77%!

&#x200B;

The list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:

* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**

I personally think this is HUGE!

&#x200B;

CONS:

* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.
* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).

&#x200B;

'Whilst it's great to see that Drone Delivery Canada has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$63k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. While it hardly paints a picture of imminent growth, the fact that it has reduced its cash burn by 40% over the last year suggests some degree of prudence. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Drone Delivery Canada's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending'

They are not listed on any exchanges and intended to be held through maturity. I am very curious about them. 

Are these new? Have there been waves of these products over years? Who buys them and where do they buy from? A 2018 WSJ article seems to indicate that they are frequently sold by financial advisors.

For example:

Bank of America - contingent income issuer callable yield notes ( Linked to the Least Performing of the Dow Jones Industrial Average®, the Nasdaq-100® Index and the S&P 500® Index )

Citi -  Autocallable Contingent Coupon Equity Linked Securities Linked to the Worst Performing of Apple Inc. and The Walt Disney Company Due March 1, 2022_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts about augmented reality, what companies are people getting into Curious what folks thought about Augmented Reality and what companies to jump into. I think that AR will be a transformational/paradigm shifting technology much like the internet and aol/mosaic/netscape was in the 90's. You had pre-internet, and post internet. 

Right now there's been forays into AR with things google glass, and applications like Pokemon Go, and headsets (which I suppose are VR) like Oculus. There's projected overlays on car windshields. There are some iphone/android apps like Snapchat.

There's about a billion applications for AR. The simplest one that's already implemented in some respects is navigation. For instance, type in a destination, a line appears in the road in front of you and also in the distance you'll see a beacon of light. Another simple application would have little tags on your valuable items, put on the glasses and those tags appear bright and shiny. "Where are my keys? Oh there they are." Wacky idea, ar fish finder, put on the glasses look into the water, see the fish swimming. Google ads idea (or google nightmare idea) "billboards" appear on the horizon above businesses, or you buy the real estate in the space above your competitor and place your "billboard." (curious how much the real estate above buildings go for at this point, is there a market, where is that market, I suspect not many real estate folks are considering this implication). Nefarious use of data, color coding areas of town to show low income/high crime, or neighborhoods with better performing school scores; show where speed traps occur on the road. 

Point is you can spend hours/weeks coming up with ideas and applications for AR.

Again the technology and applications are going to be transformational, but at this time is it just too early to invest in AR? What companies do you invest in? Is it a good strategy to invest in companies that are researching the technology like Facebook, Google, Microsoft? In terms of the hardware do we just continue to invest in chip makers, optical component manufacturers, game hardware? Do we assume the software developers of today will be the same developers of the AR reality? 

I think this stuff is going to be really interesting, and a great opportunity just not sure where to began._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $AMRN DD: Why AMRN should be considered a serious investment right now and not a "wait and see." Since I cannot find a good forum of discussion (coming from WSB), I am posting my $AMRN DD here in hopes of thoughtful input. I may be new to Reddit in general, but I'm not new in investing or lurking in the subreddits and posts.

I wanted to shift gears away from the GME craze (though it is entertaining) and share my brief perspective on the up-and-coming biotech stock that is set to either increase significantly or rocket to the moon within this year. I have high expectations for Amarin Corp. ($AMRN). Let me start by saying, I am not a financial expert, nor is this financial advice, nor am I saying what to do with your monies. I am only a small time, working-man investor who has a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering, MPH in Biostatistics, am a certified PMP, and has 5+ years in therapeutic research and 2+ years in blood research. With that, here are my reasons on why people should seriously look at or invest in this company:

**TL;DR: $AMRN is a fast growing pharmaceutical company with great promise in growth, no debt a/o end of 2020, huge market monopoly, and large profits on the horizon. After, or during, the GME battle, AMRN could be a solid primary investment (low share price, but rising). They focus on heart cardiovascular health and their pilot drug reduces cardiovascular health issues by 25% and cardiovascular related deaths by 20%. Winner in the short and long run!**

**Amarin Corp ($AMRN)**

This is an Irish company that focuses on developing cost-effective (this is important for later) cardiovascular health therapeutics. Their main drug is VASCEPA which uses Icosapent Ethyl (cholesterol-regulating agent). Think of Icosapent Ethyl as a completely pure omega-3 oil you find in eating fish. In a study called REDUCE-IT (Link: [Academic Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/clc.22692)), they proved that this pure omega-3 oil reduced cardiovascular events by 25%(!) with combined use of a statin. They are FDA approved (which is the best thing for a drug company) and have patents protecting it (more on this in the Bears section). They have improved upon care coverage in 2020, been marketing heavily in Europe and China. The Chinese Society of Cardiology has included VASCEPA in treatment guidelines (Link: [Yahoo News Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vascepa-icosapent-ethyl-receives-further-113000209.html)). For COVID-19, $AMRN’s only drug has shown in a pilot study that reduces symptoms in outpatients. This is critical as COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system heavily and causes major clotting to occur in severe cases (Link: [Pilot Study Overview](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/clinical-trials/2020/12/22/14/41/vascepa-covid-19-cardiolink-9)). I really believe in this company and just want to share their accomplishments and also give a more diverse investment outlook for everyone. GME may be the now, but AMRN is a potential stable future.

A/o, 02 Feb 21, they closed at $8.80 ($0.60/7.32%); 52-wk high of $19.22 and low of $3.36; and Short Volume Ratio of 16%.

**Bullish Thoughts:**

\- FDA Approved (Link: [FDA Announcement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-use-drug-reduce-risk-cardiovascular-events-certain-adult-patient-groups#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug,milligrams%20per%20deciliter%20or%20higher))!

\- They will most likely be approved for use in Europe within 2 months because they were given a positive opinion on 28 Jan 21 by the EMA (Links: [Amarin News Announcement](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-receives-positive-chmp-opinion-icosapent-ethyl) and [EMA Opinion Article](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/summaries-opinion/vazkepa)). Based on speculation, this approval could be mid-Feb to early Mar, but no later than end of Mar per EMA criteria (Link: [EMA FAQs Section \[Look under 'Questions about medicines'\]](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/about-us/frequently-asked-questions#questions-about-medicines-section)).

\- No other drug in this category can match their cost to benefit ratio ($1.79 per capsule or $430 for 240/$50 per prescription).

\- Application to be sold in China is almost guaranteed (finished Clinical Stage 3 w/ positive results) and already has a Chinese manufacturing/distribution partner (EddingPharm) (Link: [News Article](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/19/2130631/0/en/Amarin-Shares-Topline-Data-from-Partner-s-Pivotal-Phase-3-Study-of-VASCEPA-Icosapent-Ethyl-in-Mainland-China.html))

\- Generic companies cannot gain control in the EU and Chinese markets with this great cost to benefit ratio.

\- They are debt-free a/o the beginning of this year with $550 mil in cash and investments.

\- HUGE markets in EU and China compared to U.S.

\- 10 year minimum protection on their patents in the EU market.

**Bearish Thoughts:**

\- They lost 6 patents in the U.S. due to a lost lawsuit from 2 generic companies. It tanked the stock back in March, but I believe Wall Street overreacted because pharmacies rather buy the original/cheap drug over a generic (Link: [News Article Link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amarin-loses-patent-appeal-in-vascepa-lawsuit-stock-dips-2020-09-04)).

\- They are suing a generic and insurance company for manipulating the market of their drug, patent infringement, and drug coverage manipulation. Though it seems a sure bet they will win, it is still a 50/50 chance they will succeed (link: [Amarin News Announcement](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-expands-cardiovascular-risk-reduction-patent-infringement)).

\- They are struggling with selling the product in the U.S. There is high demand, but not enough sales coverage.

\- VASCEPA is their ONLY product with no other pipelines. This opens them up to be boxed in by competition.

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I’ll share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing’s Matternet… Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why there’s such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn’t get sick, can workday and night, it doesn’t have to take breaks or spend half of it’s time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn’t need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don’t care if there’s pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‘green’ approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel & post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil & gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company’s patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company’s drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX® Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market – at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 – claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

**Summary**: $*TAKOF* is ready for a take off! It’s literally in their name.

Seriously, given all the craziness in the current market I wouldn’t rule out this reaching $10 in the next months. Especially if expansion to US is confirmed.

Currently I've decided to start researching holiday/travelling market as I expect (I know its very optimistic) Covid to start easing off by the end of the year and so naturally travelling and holiday sectors should bounce back.

Accor Hotels caught my eye with surprisingly low share price currently. I think I must be missing something. Ok, so corona happened and of course the hotel chains got hit hard. Fair enough, their financial report for 2020 looks dreadful.

However, I've looked at their previous financial reports and I've seen a stable growth pattern. From 2018 to 2019 their revenue jumped by almost 15%. I'd say that is really impressive. In addition to that, before corona in 2019 they've started expanding their portfolio and diversifying which I thought was a great move.

Now, talking about share price, Accor currently sits at 29euros in the Paris stock exchange which is roughly $35 a share. Now, in comparison, in 2019 Starwood (which was acquired by Marriot recently) traded at almost $90 a share when in reality they are smaller than Accor and doesn't boast the same capital and assets as Accor does. Before corona, Accor's share price was floating around 40euros.

Am I right to assume they are undervalued and there is money to be made here long term or is it just because they are not floating on New York Stock Exchange and thus doesn't have the same potential demand for shares as an American chain like Starwood was?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Losing massive unrealized gains I’ve always been a buy and hold type guy investing in companies that I want to hold very long term, along with ETFs for long term growth for early retirement. 

Over the past year, I’ve also began actively trading in riskier short term stocks. Some of those active trades grew well beyond what I could have ever imagined, up where I was sitting on VERY large in unrealized gains. While it’s not money I would have used short term, it would have been amazing to have. 

I always go beyond my exit strategy because I always say “what if it keeps going up and I keep getting greedy. Essentially it gets to the point when I tell my significant other I’m up X on this stock and before I know it the price is much less than I could have gotten. I get out with a profit, but it’s never close to what I originally could have had. 

Then, there are times where I’ve sold too soon. And could have had somewhat life changing money if I just held on 3 or 6 more months. 

I’ve always hated stop losses because I feel like sometimes the stock bounces right back up after a little dip. 

Essentially, I’m wondering the following:

1. How do you deal with massive loss of unrealized gains? Right now I’m just mad at myself, but know if I made it once, I can do it again but just shouldn’t chase. 

2. How do you fight the urge to keep holding when you know you should get out? 

3. Do you have any stop loss strategies? Ex: in 25% increments of total investment?

4. How do you move on and not fall in love with that specific stock? I would think I constantly keep checking it and seeing what I could have had. 

Sorry for this ramble, but looking for anything positive to think about and get better at this.

I am young and fairly healthy and I have accident insurance benefits. I don't foresee needing a large percentage of it in the near future, just small amounts for things like doctor's visits. Were an accident happen, my accident insurance policy covers a large sum that looks like it would bring me up to the out-of-pocket maximum. 

Why shouldn't I invest all my funds into a fund with an aggressive allocation type now and then move them to a retirement fund later?

In particular, I'm starting to wonder if holding rolling call options for companies I would have otherwise bought stocks in isn't perhaps better than outright owning shares. My understanding is as follows:

Pros:

* Portfolio has leveraged upside
* Risk is limited to the premium
* No risk of margin calls
* Realizing profits on a regular basis

Cons:

* Risk of losing entire premium with nothing to show for it when option is way OTM when it's time to roll over
* Tax implications?

And the stock will double._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I’m feeling bullish on Gap Inc (GPS) I recently bought into GPS at about 22.50, and I really think GPS has the potential to go to at least 30 this year. Although short interest has increased for the stock (roughly 10%), different analyst reports have set target prices for gap anywhere from 19 to 27 dollars, and so I think it is a relatively stable stock right now. 

What I really think is going to boost this stock is the upcoming Yeezy collaboration with Gap. This collaboration was announced in July 2020 and is reported to be a 10 year deal. The target release date was slated to be first half of 2021. Aside from a small leak of potential designs in October 2020, there has been no news ever since. 

One thing I know about Yeezy branded stuff, is that it gets instantly sold out whenever there is a new drop. Despite the intentional pivot to affordable clothing ($50-100 for an item instead of $300-500), I truly believe that Yeezy Gap will also see similar supply and demand issues. 

None of the market reports I have read mention Yeezy at all. 

Essentially the thesis of my argument is that stock value isn’t always inherently tied to company value. A large amount of it can be hype, and when it comes to hypebeasts, Yeezy is a holy grail._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ apple put/call ratio of 0.2 ... weird sideward movement of apple stock

Of course, this triggered a wash sale. I just realized today that my losses were greater and my brokerage told me it was because of a wash sale. 

&#x200B;

Does this mean I am losing more money? I know there are tax implications. So I can't use the initial loss on my tax returns, but what if I sell again at a loss. Can I use it then? Basically I'm a nooby who made a mistake (don't we all), and I'd like some help in understanding the ramifications of it. Would someone please basically ELI5 on what I need to do from here? I don't want to get into any legal trouble. 

&#x200B;

Any guidance is appreciated. Thank you very much.

Hot Poblano_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ETF and chill vs. actively picking stocks I am working a full time job and over the past few years I learned that I am not good at picking stocks. I have had good and bad picks that over time it evens out almost to the level of SPY. I actually wanted to take more risk that SPY and that's why I started buying individual stocks. 

In recent months I started moving my portfolio to TQQQ, SPXL, TMF and some ARK ETFs. Because of my age and future income it makes sense for me to take on riskier investments. 

Moving to ETFs had a nice impact. I don't care about news on companies anymore. I don't care if Tesla sold more cars than NIO or not. I don't count the days to the earning calls to see how my stock pick will perform. It liberated me to focus on my day job which actually funds my investing portfolio 

What your experience with ETFs vs. individual stocks has been?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Limit order system (long term) Hi all,

Let's say I want to spend a constant amount of money in ETF's every week (very risk averse). I could do this either by buying for market value (market order) or by placing an offer for a fixed amount of money (limit order). Wouldn't it be smartest to place a limit order every week, by calculating the variance of the price per week over the last year and just place that bet that has a 95% change to actually hit that low? Thereby profiting from the almost inevitable fluctuation of the stocks?

The only case of when you would lose money is when you actually wanted to buy but it didn't happen because the stocks went up (5% of the cases). But then you will have invested the week before that, so there is no drama at all.

I'm not an experienced investor so I wanted to check this before actually doing the calculations in which I'm most likely to make a lot of wrong assumptions. I know it is highly unlikely that I'll beat the market based on skill so I'll probably make a fool out of myself but OK._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on buying Revolut on the secondary market pre-IPO? Is share dilution a significant threat? Shares in the FinTech company Revolut are currently available to buy on Seedrs in the secondary market. Their current indicative valuation is $4.25 bn, quite substantially less than the valuation of $5.5bn during the last funding round. Presume this is due to a fall in travel, which as a 'borderless bank' they make a lot of revenue from.

I think the long term fundamentals of Revolut are still very promising. They doubled the number of users from 2019 to 2020, and gross profit margins are still negative but falling rapidly. They have introduced a suite of new features, from business banking to trading stocks & crypto through the App.

My question isn't as much whether Revolut is a good investment or not, though keen to hear any thoughts on this, as what the risk of share dilution is when they eventually IPO or from additional funding rounds. Would this erode any gains?

Since the transfer, they transferred all but 5 shares as well as some cash in my account, but they deactivated my account. I’ve reached out to them multiple times to activate my account to allow me to sell my positions and withdraw cash. Then they can deactivate it again.  Right now, I can't sell my shares nor can I withdraw my cash due to the account deactivation.

Anyone know how I can get through their non-existent customer service? This certainly is helping me to never come back, for sure.

Do I have any recourse or someone I can file a complaint with regarding this? Maybe the SEC? I can’t imagine that it’s allowable to have a broker seize assets due to a transfer.

US Steel – 42M new shares & strategy: ~1400 words or 7-20 minutes at ~150 WPM, add 15 minutes if you check the links, which you should as a best practice.

Hey everyone,

I’ve enjoyed the bit of attention to my posts on my bullish analysis on US Steel (X), and I wanted to do another somewhat brief write-up in response to news hot off the press. Another reddit user pointed out that they just issued 42 million shares – I have never encountered this before as a stock I’ve analyzed so I figured I’d do some research as I constantly strive to develop my investing strategy. I’ve got a ton of links for y’all so you can fact check and do your damn due diligence (D^4). This is compared to a previous 220M shares so if you take it at face value before additional considerations it’s a roughly 20% dilution. We’re going to use that number for valuation.

Analysis: Instead of holding onto cash, either for investment purposes in new facilities or to pay current debt or handle other volatility, X issued a dividend. A microscopic dividend. In considering the cause, an intuitive answer I’ve come up with is as a bullish indicator of strength.

Historical context(lots of links)

https://www.investopedia.com/us-steel-stock-hits-all-time-low-4799379

If you’ve paid any attention to my posts, X or just entered “X Stock” into Google or Bing and looked at the historical value of the stock, you will see that the share went up to the 170s in 2008 (holy fuck), and then post-crash it went down to around $16.70. I haven’t been able to find the steel index for as far back as 2008, but presumably it was pretty good for X to be that profitable, pre-crash. I did find however data for the last 6 years which I think tells a compelling story.

By 2010, the stock went back up to a high of 63.44 – a 400% ROI if you bought at the low of 16.70.

2015 – down to a terrible low of 6.15 which I believe is lowest in stock history.

2016: This is where things get really interesting. In January CRU is around the 390s/ low 400s, and X is around $7. By June, CRU is at 628 in that 6 months (50% increase in CRU), but X is up to 16.86 (250% ROI). It makes sense that a stock will go up if their product goes up sharply, but that disproportionate increase relates to some degree to the static fixed costs making the overall profit margin much higher. If you held on an additional month to July, X went to 27.49 for over 400% ROI in 7 months.

In 2018 we see X start the year around 39, peak at 45ish and then make a steady decline with some volatility all the way down until 2020. On the CRU side we see 675 in mid Jan to a peak of about 915 6-7 months later in June / July. There seems to be some sort of mismatch with X stock going down while CRU went up. Of note is that around 2018, the Big River plant started ($1.9 billion) and was completed in 19 months. I’m not going to spend weeks on research, but some ideas I have for the mismatch are 1) Investors already baked-in the rising CRU into the stock, 2) there was a drop in the dow from 26.5 to 23s/24s – perhaps construction and auto went down around that time, and perhaps we 3) see some significant investment spending and 4) investors factored in upcoming world-supply of steel as manufacturers built out capacity (China flooding world steel market, eager to take out our industry) 5) I’ve read about some X hiccups over the years.

In 2018 versus 2017 we see an increase in net earnings of 523M (9 months ended September) versus 228 in 2017 (9 months ending September), a 250% increase), and they did capital expenditures of 640M versus 291 in 2017 (roughly 250%). When they made big money, they invested it. Overall stockholders equity went up from 9.86B to 10.56B, debt increased by about 85B in total (lots of debt added and lots of debt paid in various categories)

From 2018 to 2020 we see a steady decrease with a lot of volatility that I’m sure people made big money on (swings of 20-50% 1-3 months multiple times).

2019 and 2020 start out terrible – 2020 by September has a loss of 1.2B versus net income of 38M in 2019. Yikes. We do however see that the total assets increased slightly from 11.6B to 11.7B. So they did a decent job at not selling off their income sources. Note that they went from 750B cash and cash equivalents to 1.7B (250%). Someone did a damn good job picking up liquidity – they haven’t been around since 1900ish for no reason! 

 

End of 2020 – really important (pages 5,6,7)

Despite a terrible year, financial magic takes X from a low of 750M cash assets in Dec 2019 back to 2B in 2020 – X has a demonstrated ability to generate lots of liquidity. The overall year has a loss of 1.17B, which isn’t surprising since the first 3 quarters were just terrible. Note 725M in capital expenditures in 2020 despite the rough year financing – someone in charge knows that there are things worth investing in (additional Big River-style plants?!?) It is NOW in the 4th quarter and 2021 that things are back to looking up again. By all measures steel appears to be cyclical and X has overall very sharp relation to the CRU index.

 

Now / TLDR: Steel hit a historical high of 1150 in the last day. X stock has in multiple cycles achieved a 250% to 400% ROI from lows to CRU peaks which typically occur around 6-7 months later. CRU index goes down as China pumps out steel – but Trump Tariffs & corporatist Biden seems likely to keep tariffs in place – the CEO of X in the recent earnings call seemed very confident that tariffs would remain in place – let’s be honest, someone probably talked to someone behind a closed door, their was fancy cheese and fancier alcohol, probably golf a technically-illegal cigar. All of my optimism for the stock’s value over next 6-7 months does not heavily factor in a successful infrastructure US government plan but that would be best case scenario.  Overall, I still believe that X is likely to reach the 30s-40s within the next 6-7 months barring some exceptional crisis. More than that, I have a suspicion that they are building up cash reserves to try to roll-out additional Big-River style plants. X went down to 16.50 today which I think is a nice discount for buy-in. I also think that even if X doesn’t shoot up this year, the hype around additional plants will mean healthy increases into the 20s and 30s over next 2 years – the Big River plant is apparently the first of its kind – see quote below – in a few ways. I think the upwards potential from overall economic conditions outweighs the dilution from shares issued – these executives aren’t stupid, they are doing what they believe will increase the share’s value and companies health. They have a demonstrated aptitude for managing liquidity and building capacity even in downturns.

I keep seeing comments about short interest on $GME. I'm not popular enough to post on some other subs so hopefully this sub will take me.

Exact short interest is beyond reach for most of us, but we can get a good estimate from services like Ortex. From my experience, they are usually within 10% of the exchange reported interest, and they're a good ballpark for sentiment.

SO... what happened over the last few days:

&#x200B;

|Date|Estimated short interest|Price high|SI movement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|25-Jan|71.4M|159|444K|
|26-Jan|65.8M|150|(5.7M)|
|27-Jan|51M|**380**|**(14.7M)**|
|28-Jan|38.6M|**483**|**(12.4M)**|
|29-Jan|29.4M|414|(9.2M)|
|1-Feb|27M|322|(2.4M)|
|2-Feb|27.1M|158|**99K (this is a big deal)**|

The hedge funds cleared a lot of short interest from Jan 27-Jan 29. This caused $GME price to spike. They didn't do it all at once, but instead did it slowly, so the price never hit rocket levels. Instead we saw a squeeze that looked more like rolling hills than a rocket. For those who were doing their DD, this was still a huge win.

This week, they're playing a new game. They're holding their short position relatively flat & even doubling down (see net SI \*increase\* yesterday).

I am not a financial advisor. This is my opinion._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For the long term investor. Walmart is the best buy My regard for walmart has been high. Their grocery delivery service in my area has become virtually flawless in the past few months

I work in the auto repair industry. Our franchise saw an insane boost of traffic following the closure of the walmart auto care centers. Some of which remain closed as walmart took a low-risk approach to covid. Rightly so, because many of the people who have been working on cars have caught covid. They're just not reporting the cases. It's one of those fields that flew under the radar in regulation.

I believe that as walmart ramps up the re opening of their auto care centers, they're earning reports are going to skyrocket. The wal mart auto care center is the largest competition in regards to automotive repair as they do offer some wildly low prices on shit. 

The fact they have done so well after shutting down such a major function of their stores shows they have thrived in other areas. I see walmart becoming a formidable competitor to Amazon as they use their current delivery service (using their subsidized postmates) to pivot into the market. Its certainly worked on me with Walmart+

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CMV: Growth stocks are becoming a bubble and present more downside risk than non-cyclical value stocks The sentiment among both retail investors and institutional investors seems to be that growth is king.

This is mostly fueled by the fact that companies such as Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, and Facebook have appreciated in value substantially faster than "value" stocks such as T, VZ, LUMN, KR. Investors see the returns growing companies provide, and project similar trends. If investing in Tesla provided a 10x return in a year, why invest in a boring stagnant company like AT&T that pays a 7% dividend and lost value?

To me, this seems very reminiscent of 1999/2000, where fast growing tech companies were valued tremendously high. Much like now, the idea was earnings would keep growing, so these high valuations would be justified by high earnings in the future. Investors seem very much focused on "investing in the companies of the future" and thus prices have grown much faster than earnings have.

One common misconception is that in 2000, the bubble was all unprofitable tech companies with no feasible business model, whereas today, growth companies like Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft are profitable.

While companies with bad business models crashed the hardest, profitable tech companies were still overvalued in 2000 too. 

Cisco, for example, was profitable in 1999, yet it dropped in value by 75%, and still has not recovered from 2000 highs.

Contrast that with a "boring" non-tech value company like Walmart, which barely budged during the tech bubble crash.

Share appreciation is an important aspect of total returns, but share appreciation is entirely dependent on investor sentiment. 

Right now, enthusiasm for growth is at record highs. Investors are willing to buy unprofitable companies with the expectation they will grow rapidly and eventually become a profitable giant, and they can sell for more.

It's important to ask yourself- what happens if this sentiment disappears as it did in 2000? Suppose investors suddenly decide paying over 60x annual revenue and over 600x EPS for a company like Shopify is no longer justified, and the price of such growth stocks drops 75%. Are you comfortable with that?

In my opinion, growth is important, but the best way to value a stock fairly is to base it on the assumption that you can't sell it for 100 years, but any capital returned to shareholders can be reinvested either back into the company, or elsewhere using the discount rate you chose to discount value of distributions. 

When you do that, it takes swings in investor sentiment out of the question. You're no longer vulnerable to market volatility. The question becomes "will this company provide a positive return given a discount rate on future cash flows?"

If the answer to that question is "no", then you're basing your entire investment on faith that the market will be continue to place a high valuation on growth and be willing to pay excessively for it. if that sentiment remains, great, you can profit. But if it doesn't, then you're stuck either holding the bag on an illiquid investment, or selling for a loss.

It is my view that in the next decade, value stocks with low P/E ratios in less cyclical industries(ie consumer staples, telecommunications), will experience lower volatility than growth stocks with negative earnings or high P/E ratios, due to having consistent cash flows to back up valuations.

I believe a handful of growth companies that do extraordinarily well will outperform a broad basket of value based companies, but the majority will not._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rate My Portfolio (19 Years Old) Hi all,

I also see a similar pattern in daily trading as I did in GME: A 15%-20% run up to around noon, then a 5-10% drop and a leveling off for the rest of the day. Perhaps shorts cover up to noon and purposes kill of momentum after?

In terms of options, IV is ~163% with IV and HV percentiles at 47% and 52%, respectively.

Gotta cover my ass. yada yada dada_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some thoughts on CCL/CUK (Carnival plc), and cruiseliners in general Seems like everybody is still has a very negative outlook on the cruiseline industry.

With vaccination programs accelerating worldwide, why is the entire industry still valued so low? I understand there still is risk wrt how fast governments will allow leasure travel again, but a lot of middle-class people got trough covid without job loss, and will have saved up spare cash to spend on postponed vacations.

Another argument against buying cruiseline stocks is that a lot of them had little to no revenue over the past year, and had to load up on debts.

Companies like Carnival seem to have a steady cash burn rate, and have their debt under control (so far!). The argument for the pent up demand is also shown by advanced bookings: the first half of 2022 is already ahead of 2019.

So what are your arguments for not buying into this sector?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LUMN - Lumen Technologies - Value buy, long position, lots of potential **THIS IS A LONG POSITION**

&nbsp;


**Why I invested:**

*  The largest upside I see in Lumen's future growth is their fiber infrastructure. Depending on what source you reference, Lumen either has the largest fiber network in the US or is in the top 3 along with AT&T and Verizon. In either case, the need for larger, wider-reaching fiber networks will only grow in the future. In my opinion, 5G will be the springboard that propels the next great leap in technological advances. 

&nbsp;

* [Tier 1 network provider (Approx. 7 in the US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network), ranked [#1 in terms of CAIDA AS Rank (The CAIDA AS Rank is a rank of importance on the internet)](https://asrank.caida.org/). What that means: They provide/have the capability to provide the most internet connections to direct customers (other smaller networks(Tier 2) and indirect customers/end users (even smaller networks (Tier 3) and eventually you and I). 
  * Maybe an analogy to help better explain this is to think of it like railroads (I know it is much more complicated, especially with railroads, but simplifying for this purpose).
      * BNSF (Tier 1 Network in this case) owns, maintains and uses the rail lines (fiber network) between Seattle and Chicago. They have trains running regularly but their rail lines are far from being congested so they allow smaller rail transport companies to use their tracks for a fee.
      * Amtrak (Tier 2 Network) cant afford to build/maintain their own cross country rail lines but have passengers they need to get from Seattle to Chicago. So they pay BNSF to use their rail lines to efficiently get their customers to their destination.


          ^ To tie up this example for network traffic, there are only 7 Tier 1 networks and all smaller companies need them to provide service to their customers.  

&nbsp;
 
* 9.5% annual dividend yield (very high relative to market) 

 - Per multiple reports I've read, this number does not seem sustainable, but [they actually have been doing this while also paying off their debts.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LUMN/lumen-technologies/debt-equity-ratio) 

&nbsp;

**What this all adds up to:**

Their share price has suffered over the past decade because CenturyLink was unfocused while also being obligated to provide dying services (landline) and trying to compete with other ISPs. While they have held and made new substantial infrastructure investments in fiber and network services, the business was not focused on where they can increase profitability.

&nbsp;

Enter rebranding to Lumen in September 2020. They have been and will continue to trim the fat through reorganization/restructuring to focus on their network services and enterprise solutions. Their available infrastructure has them well positioned for growth as their fiber internet becomes more widely available and increased demand with 5G networks emerging.

&nbsp;

All of this on top of the expectation that their nearly 10% dividend yield should bolster an investment in the short term while their growth goals materialize.

I'm not sure this is the right place for this but I can't find another suitable sub.  I've played around with stocks for years but only ever straight purchases.  I believe I conceptually understand options but wanted a sanity check.  

I'm on etrade.  I've got options access.  If I place a call trade for mar5 strike $6 it gives me estimated total cost of $475.  This represents the premium and is fine no matter what if I complete the trade.  That premium gives me the option to purchase this 100 shares of this stock for $6 on mar5, correct?  So if the stock is worth $10 on mar5 I can net $4k (actually $3525 factoring in premium).  Do I understand this correctly?

There's good info on Google but I wanted to sanity check a real example._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on long-term leveraged ETF's with an All-Weather diversified portfolio. (Retirement Account) After looking for ways to help increase my returns for my retirement account, I'm 28 so long way to go, I noticed this website discussing the option of using Ray Dalio's "All-Weather" diversification model but using leveraged ETF's to help boost it's returns. 

https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/

I like the all weather approach compared to a split of bonds and stock index funds because you cover all the seasons of the market. 

I know the large debate over long term leveraged ETF's are volatility and leverage decay, plus putting all of your money into one such as SSO (purely the stock market) is that in the long term it will lead to your demise.

But by covering multiple fronts are you not reducing the risk of a overall downturn in your portfolio? On top of that bull markets last much longer than bear markets and there are times when all the "seasons" are going up. Where as when one sector goes down, another usually goes up (stocks and bonds).

Another argument is that some people can't stomach the higher volatility in an account such as your retirement.

I can see if you're looking to liquidate your assets in the next 5 years that you'd want to have a less volatile approach but for someone not looking to touch the money and put in monthly contributions I can see this being a great long-term investment. You could even go from a AW2 to a regular AW as you near and enter retirement.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Verizon Downtrend = Buying Opportunity I have no clue as to why, and I can only assume so much but Verizon has been sliding to a 6 month low point. Now to many this is no surprise it is a dying company in a industry with very low growth and the company itself has no plans of growth. But a dying company is not worthless and I think Verizon might soon be reaching a good buy point, and the only reason to buy would be the great dividend it provides. It could also become a good flip buying low catching a quick rally before selling off. I am looking at a support of around 54.50 or even lower at 54. Despite this being my buy points, it could even continue to slide to March lows as the market puts focus on high flyers and not solid dividend companies.

Feb 2021: NASDAQ: XBIT @ 19.9 USD

# Background

XBiotech is a company that has been around for over 15 years. They started out by developing antibody-drugs to combat viral and bacterial infectious diseases. On December 30, 2019 they sold their „ IL-1⍺ blocking True Human™“  antibody based drug, which was successful in treating dermatological diseases. They sold the drug to J&J for **$750 million in upfront cash and up to $600 million paid over the next years**. These news doubled the stock's market cap from about $300 to $600 million.  Just the revenue from this deal alone will give them over $50 million yearly revenue with minimal additional costs. This alone is in my opinion worth **at least** a market cap of $750 million (For the next 10 years the company has at least about $1.2 billion in cash, yearly -$20-40 Million operations ≈ $750 million)

However, with this deal the company is not allowed to work on further dermatological applications with their „ IL-1⍺True Human“ drug. - at first glance, this hinders the companies potential to grow massively, thus (paired with the covid mass selling) the stock dropped down in early 2020 to pre-deal levels within one month. Investors slowly came to their senses and the stock recovered now, Feb 2021 to almost $600 mio market cap again

# Why is this company undervalued?

It seems to me that not everybody is aware that the company actually is allowed to do further treatments with their IL-1⍺ True Human technology - they are only restricted in dermatology. 

„Completed clinical studies and a myriad of scientific research have shown that blocking IL-1⍺ may have a beneficial effect in numerous medical conditions. The potential unmet medical need for blocking inflammation through neutralizing IL-1⍺ is vast. **The Company plans to re-enter the clinic with more than one additional anti-IL-1⍺ therapy, beginning in early 2021**“.  \[[http://www.xbiotech.com](http://www.xbiotech.com)\] 

They are in collaboration with several hospitals, namely University Hospital Zürich where they are using their overflow of cash to rapidely develop therapies for cancer and liver diseases as well as strokes. 

**These are some drugs they are working on:**

\- Animal trials showed that IL-1⍺ can treat inflammations of brain tissue after a stroke. =>If this works, this will be a true breakthrough in the field.

\- Phase II for treatment against bacterial infection (Staphylococcus Aureus infection: [https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/infections/bacterial-infections-gram-positive-bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus-infections](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/infections/bacterial-infections-gram-positive-bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus-infections)). => Already Phase II and the potential market for this is very encouraging

\- Phase I: for several cancer types => Could explode the stock or not end up working 

\- Phase I: antibody therapy vs COVID, worked in laboratory conditions better than the antibody therapy from Eli Lilly (Antibody therapy is what Trump got to recover from COVID so quickly). =>Just recently they showed that XBiotech's drug works just as well against the COVID mutation. 

This are just a few exapmles. From all of these there should be news in the upcoming months. Any of those having success will be **huge** for a company with a market cap of currently $560 million

# Catalysts (conservative numbers)

\- Seasoned company that has worked on this drug for 15 years and finally got the breakthrough

\- lots of cashflow: estimated of at least $300 million by then end of 2021

\- yearly payments from J&J of \~$50 mio for phase II study for treating dermatological diseass (see above)

\-HBM Healthcare investments, a well known, professional investor are holding 6 % stake in the company

\-COVID will likely last for at least another 1-2 years, this is plenty of time to get value out of their antibody therapy. Even when covid is over, the seasonal flu kills millions of people all over the world and the market for this drug is therefore enormous. 

# My Price Target:

Just looking at the deal with J&J and the potential from the increased cashflow I would set the very conservative price target BEFORE new announcements to **$25**. If they announce Phase II for any of the above mentioned products, or even a final product, it is hard to predict the price target without any details right now. Given the market size, cash flow and previous success of the company I would say between **$100-$150 USD** a share.  


# Final Remarks

In my opinion, XBiotech does not compare to recently hyped (not saying they are bad) biotech companies such as (SENS,BNGO, etc.). Xbiotech will stay in business for many more years for sure. It is a more save alternative with comparable upside to other small biotech companies.

Even before all of this went down I was, and still am, really interested in the fundamentals of valuing a company or industry and making an informed investment decision based on my own research. I still don't know the full extent of the ramifications this will have on the markets and investing going forward but regardless, this served as a prime example (for me at least) that it isn't always worth jumping on the bandwagon even if there seemingly is no downside potential.

However, the greater lesson for me is learning to exercise restraint and caution. With social media having so much power and influence over people it has really stressed the importance of understanding each investment you make and being intentional with your decisions. I was fortunate enough to come out of all this with only a small loss and I feel additionally fortunate that I didn't have enough capital to turn this valuable learning experience into irreversible financial damage. I understand investing isn't for everyone and some people just came in to make a quick buck (which is also okay), but I still encourage you to learn the ropes and look past the bullshit as it can be a valuable skill to have in the future.

I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business. 

What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**

Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). 

Here’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33) 

**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document 

  **For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:** 

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million** 

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**   
 

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect: 

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. 

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)): 

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.  
 

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

&#x200B;

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). 

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10): 

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*   
 

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). 

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

   
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).

This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).

\-----

Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!

I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! 

No f\*\*\* way!!!

Stopped? *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

So today was rough for those in the GME trade.  I, for example, cracked jokes in the comments to my last post about how my remaining GME holdings went from new Lexus money, through Corolla money, and briefly delved to the depths of used golf cart money.  At one point I mentioned maybe ending up with a Razor scooter in the end, but luckily ended the day with Polaris RZR type money instead.

I wasn't paying attention to the pre-market action, but right the start of normal market hours it looked like an avalanche of panic selling.  Looking back at the chart, seeing the consistent downward march of price, the gap down into early pre-US market, immediate drop at 7am pre-market, it shouldn't have been too surprising.  Likely a number of people who are unable to trade pre-market were just watching their numbers move in the wrong direction for hours before they got the chance to bail, and that's what happened immediately once the option was available.

In my previous post I had identified $150/$148 as what I thought might be the "retail line of defense".  Given the immediate open below, there was no solid support or consolidation around any level, though some hyper aggressive buying put the floor in at $74.22 at around 10:45.  I'm honestly not sure what to make of that remarkable move.   Likely it staunched the bleeding somewhat, repairing retail morale temporarily.  Once that parabolic arc slammed into the LULD halt, price action reversed and resumed a steady march downward.

So, where does that leave things at this point?  With respect to a squeeze, which I've been asked about quite a bit over the past few hours, my concern is the unlocking of so much float, given what I have to interpret as heavy panic selling.  As I covered in the Market Mechanics post, locking of liquid float is paramount and today was certainly not a help in that regard.  That being said, as I pointed out in that post, locking up the float gets cheaper at lower prices, so we shall see what happens over the next few days.

So what's next?  I don't know, and no one else does either.  Yes, that tired old answer I give in just about every post.  The thing is, it's true.  The events over the past couple of weeks have certainly reinforced that fact to me.

As with yesterday, I've been variously accused of being a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pumper and dumper, which again I take as indicating a healthy balance.  One thing I promise is that I will call it like I see it, and admit to any mistakes I make.

# Knowledge and Responsibility

Watching events unfold today had me thinking quite a bit.  About the debates across this sub and others, the media, etc.  As I've mentioned previously in comments, my purpose in creating this account was to try to help provide some information, education, and a space for healthy discussion for in particular all of the newer traders that were flocking to this particular trade.  I've been very happy to read the numerous comments and messages from various people who have expressed that they feel they've been able to learn quite a bit in a very compressed timeframe due to the intensity of focus on the situation.

I have been told by some that rather than discuss this trade or the mechanics behind it at all, I should simply flat out tell people to stay away because of the risk, and speak of it no more.  I have to admit, I was conflicted about this, because the risk is very high, as I've always stated.

That being said, I believe that participation in the market is one of the most important rights people should have, and equal participation in the market requires knowledge, transparency, and information.  You are all free to make our own choices.  Whatever others may say, You *will* make your own choices.  At least we can try to help each other make those choices with the best information we have available.

Hah, I managed to keep this post at least a little shorter!  As mentioned previously, I will probably have to keep it that way for a while due to real life responsibility.  Thank you all in advance for the great discussion.

Man, rocket rides can sure be bumpy, but it's been the most interesting week in the market I've ever seen.  Let's see what the day brings!

Good luck in the market!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ZERO CARBON LITHIUM - Rich through lithium - without environmental damage! Hello,

I want to make it clear from the start that I am not a professional financial advisor. Everything I am about to write has come from my own research. You should cross check everything and make your own decision on what you will do with this information.

DISCLAIMER: This is not going to be a PUMP & DUMP. I don't want to achieve that either. I report here because I am convinced of the idea and the company!  


EDIT:  

Guys! I did try my best to reply to your comments. Here is a Video showing how the process works. Of course this is very simplified: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw)

I hope this helps you better understand what it's all about. Please inform yourself well before you invest. I do not recommend investing to anyone who does not believe in the idea. This company can also fail, you are warned. I welcome all others who are sure that this project will conquer the market.

**What is it about?**

I've been watching an interesting company since December 2020 that advertises with the following slogan: "We exist to decarbonize the currently high carbon production footprint of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles." The company is called Vulcan Energy Resources\[1\].

ISIN: AU0000066086

WKN: A2PV3A

**How did you find the company?**

I became aware of the company because I see that there is a trend towards sustainable investing\[2\]. So I started looking for a company that appealed to me. At some point I came across an article that a project was underway to extract lithium without damaging the environment\[3\]. Gripped by the topic, I spent several days trying to find out what was going on and what it was all about.

**What about sustainability?**

ZERO CARBON LITHIUM: The project is called Zero Carbon Lithium\[4\] and is being driven by Vulcan Energy Resources as mentioned above. The current main way to extract and refine lithium, from hard rock mines, will emit about 1.05 billion tons of CO2 to produce the amount of lithium needed to electrify all the world's passenger cars. Unlike current lithium extraction methods, Zero Carbon Lithium will have virtually no impact on the public or the environment. That means no large open pit mines, no large, unsightly, water-guzzling evaporation ponds, or process plants that run on fossil fuels.

After reading that, I was hooked for now. But not yet ready to invest. Moreover, the share was still a penny stock at the time. That was too risky for me. So I looked weekly to see if something is about to happen.

**The Decision:**

Investing based on an idea is never a good idea, so I took a close look at the company and the idea:

1. Since I already had a bad experience once, with such a young idea, I first looked how often and how well information is published\[5\]. Surprisingly, it is published diligently and everything fits so far. ✔
2. Publishing is one thing, the other is whether there is something behind it. Since listed companies have a disclosure obligation, it is easy to see whether the figures from the Investor Centre correspond to those on the stock exchange\[6\]. ✔
3. Financially, you can't do an analysis á la Warren Buffet here. The company is still young, and has a lot to invest. Nevertheless, I took a look at what is going on. Quick Analysis: More assets than liabilities ✔. Equity consistently increased ✔. Cash flow and net income: naturally in the red due to the investments ✖. More does not make sense here, as said value investing does not work here.
4. Vulcan operates a lot of geothermal plants and is familiar with the matter. So there is internal and independent expertise in geothermal and lithium on site for project execution\[7\]. ✔
5. Location - the right market, compelling supply-demand dynamics: being at the center of the European lithium ion battery industry is a major advantage for a semi-bulk product. Europe will be the world's fastest-growing lithium ion battery production center in the 2020s, with no local supply of lithium hydroxide.\[7\] ✔
6. Positive framework study: world-leading industry experts in lithium extraction and geothermal energy are behind the first study of its kind, which provides a solid foundation for the start of feasibility studies planned soon.\[7\] ✔
7. I understood how the process works and read the feasibility study.Not only lithium is extracted but also other rare metals\[9\]. ✔

If you go through my sources with interest, you will see that there is a very solid basis behind the project. But what was the deciding point for me to invest was the fact that Vulcan intentionally requested a trading halt while they were conducting the study to prevent wild speculation. This happened once in January2021\[9\] and once now around February 2021\[10\]. I got in in January because that was a sign to me that Vulcan was serious.

In addition, Vulcan gave a presentation to the EU Commission, with positive feedback. Vulcan has signed a binding agreement with the EU-funded EIT InnoEnergy as part of the Business Investment Platform (BIP) of the European Battery Alliance (EBA) initiative of the European Commission. This agreement is expected to significantly accelerate the momentum of Vulcan's Zero Carbon Lithium project. The project is located in Germany, at the center of the fastest growing lithium market in the world: the European battery industry for electric vehicles \[11\].

**What's in store for the future?**

I can't see into the future, of course, but I am sure that with this project electric vehicles will gain significant momentum. Also, the EU would be more independent and I personally like that a lot. In addition, there is no need to dry salt lakes or make bad environmental cuts like in other countries. I also see it critically that we consume here, and in mines at the other end of the world people have to work life-threatening for our luxury.

**Is $VUL the next $GME?**

Please, this is not a comparison. This is about the environment and the future of next generations. I am against PUMP&DUMP! If you are convinced of a company you invest and don't gamble!

**Is now the right time?**

I do not know. You have to decide that for yourself. I am invested myself in the meantime, because I am convinced of the idea therefore I will hold the share also with fluctuations. I got in at \~4.00 - 5.00€.

I like tracking spin offs as potential value plays, this one struck me as interesting, but I don't know the industry well and would be curious to hear others ideas.

Verint does business analytics and customer experience software with a fairly large customer base. As of Feb 2, they've completed a spin off of their cybersecurity division - Cognyte - which primarily works with governments (80%) and large enterprises (20%) for data analysis and security applications.

Superficially, CGNT appears to be in the same space as Palantir, although they claim a smaller addressable market, but are actually profitable already(!) As an outsider, I have no idea how to compare the two, except to say they're in the same industry.

Question is, which do you prefer to own, the parent company (VRNT) or the spin off (CGNT)?

I can see two potential ways to play this.

(1) As an established cybersecurity provider, if CGNT deserves a comparable multiple to PLTR, it is possibly underpriced currently. Who knows if that's an accurate comparison, however.

(2) An industry competitor of Verint, NICE Inc, recently did a similar move of spinning out their cyber-security division. The move by VRNT could be to make an acquisition/merger by NICE more palatable (mergers of companies that deal with governments may cause horrific red tape and hold-ups). 

Both companies are Israeli, NICE has a lot of cash on the balance sheet possibly to grease an acquisition. This segment of the enterprise software market is very fragmented so an acquisition may be attractive, and possibly profitable for VRNT stockholders (...if it happens).



Your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Myth of the Short Ladder Attack The idea that hedge funds are lowering the price of certain stocks through coordinated "short ladder attacks" has been all over reddit the past couple of days. I've heard multiple versions of the story about how these work, all of which go something like this:
> To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.

**The TL;DR here is that short ladder attacks don't exist.** Due to the way the market is structured, activity like the kind described above can't affect prices in even the short run. To explain why, I'll first need to explain how the exchanges match up orders to execute trades.

**The order book**

For every stock listed on major exchanges, there is a list of requests to buy a stock at a price (called bid orders) and a similar list of requests to sell (called ask orders). A typical bid order says something like "I'm willing to buy 100 shares of company ABC at $10.00 per share", and a typical ask order says something like "I'm willing to sell 15 shares of ABC at $10.05 per share". Exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ collect these orders into a list and sort them by price, so that the highest bid price and the lowest ask price sit on top of the respective sides of the order book. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask prices is called the spread.

For example, let's say that the two example orders above are the highest bid and lowest ask orders for ABC. If someone submits a market sell order of 20 shares of ABC, they will have the entire order executed at $10.00 per share. The bid price will remain at $10.00 per share, but there are now only 80 shares available at that price. If someone places a market buy order form 20 shares of ABC, they will have 15 shares executed at $10.05 and 5 shares executed at the next lowest ask price. This would widen the spread for ABC. If you place a limit buy order for 20 shares of ABC at $9.95 per share, this would go in the order book under the bid of $10.00, and you won't get your order filled until all shares listed for sale at $10.00 are sold first.

Some of the highest volume traders are called "market makers". They place both bid and ask orders around recently traded prices and hope to make money buy collecting the spread. They can lose money if the movement in price is bigger than the spread, so spreads are typically wider for more volatile names. High frequency traders make money by looking at the structure of the order book and the order flow and using algorithms to predict which way it will move.

**The NBBO and the SIP**

NBBO stands for National Best Bid/Offer, and refers to the highest bid price and lowest ask price across all exchanges. According to SEC rules, any broker must execute their client's buy orders at the lowest ask price and the sell orders at the highest bid price. Quotes of the NBBO and records of trade prices and volume are broadcast on SIP (Security Information Processes) feeds, which all executing brokers are listening too so that they can make informed decisions about the market.

**Why short attacks can't really work**

With this much information about the market being broadcast, the type of short attack described above is impossible. If potential short attackers executed a trade at a price lower than the national best bid, everyone listening to the SIP feed would know about it and their illegal activity would be extremely obvious. Certainly, whoever owned the bid at the top of the book would be pretty annoyed, since a worse buy order just got filled.

And even if they don't wind up getting in trouble for it, the best bid price is still sitting there waiting to be filled by a sell order. Any broker executing a retail sell order would have to execute at the best available bid price according to the NBBO rules. And any market maker or high frequency trader will see what's happening and should know to ignore it.

The only way these shorters could actually drive the price down would be to burn through the entire buy side of the order book until they reach some target price. This can move the price down, but typically it gets harder and harder the further you get into the order book. High frequency traders and day trading algorithms would also be able to catch on and start placing bids so they can buy at these artificially low prices, and the impact of the short trade will decay over time. As a result, the bears would have increased the amount of short they needed to cover without moving the price all that much, and they'll have lost some money in the process.

**So what causes market crashes like GME had on 1/29?**

For a crash like this to happen, sellers need to cross the spread to get their sells filled faster than the buy side of the book can replenish, causing the buy side of the book to thin out and vanish until it regains support at a lower level. This is basically order book speak for "a lot more people wanted to sell than buy". Beyond that it's hard to figure out exactly what happened, but it was probably a combination of some of the following:

* Market makers had bought enough of GME that they didn't want to risk buying more and/or got a sell signal, so they pulled or lowered their bids
* Bid side support from retail investors thinned or vanished after some brokers locked them out from buying more
* Bid side support from previous shorts like Melvin thinned or vanished as shorts finished up covering their positions
* New investors opened up short positions if they felt GME was overpriced
* Some retail traders who rode the wave up took a profit at the perceived peak
* As the price began to fall, retailers who bought on margin were forced to liquidate at market price (the exact opposite of a short squeeze)
* As the price began to fall, long investors panicked and sold
* As the price began to fall, sellers of options decreased their stake used to hedge as option delta decreased (a downward gamma squeeze)

Anyone who sold at the top of this crash probably contributed to the decline, but that doesn't make it market manipulation. If a trader of any kind looked at the order book, decided the buy side was thin, and sold, that's just a good trade.

As far as I can tell, the notion of a short ladder attack is completely made up. Not only is it technically infeasible, but [there was little to no mention of it anywhere on the web just a couple weeks ago](https://www.truthorfiction.com/what-is-a-short-ladder-attack/). I'm guessing it's just an excuse that bulls invented and parroted when prophecies of price spikes didn't come true._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Timber - New NYSE listing - West Fraser Timber (WFG) - Commodities are hot Lumber prices about 2.5- 3 times a year ago and longer term price history This new listing after the merger of West Fraser **Timber** ([WFT.to](https://WFT.to)) with Norbord (OSB)

West Fraser started trading on NYSE Feb 2.  The merger completed after the close Feb 2nd, and Feb 3 will be the first day of trading for the merged company.

This combination of the world's largest lumber producer, with the largest OSB producer, brings synergies to two very efficient, very profitable companies, at a moment in time when lumber and OSB/plywood are near all time  $ highs and demand is high and looks to be prolonged - perhaps several years (go read the transcripts from DHI or TOL or WY)

West Fraser / Norbord are headquartered in Canada but have the majority of their production in the US and by for most of their sales in the US.  Being formerly traded on the TMX in Toronto - the move to NY will soon bring into investors horizon that the combined company looks very attractive vs it's US based peers.  Over time, (days, weeks, months) the gap will close.  The US based lumber producers appear attractive right now as their valuations are increasing.

Think they touch our options or institute a transaction tax?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think Lemonade is overvalued Hi all,

I'd like to explain why I believe LMND is currently overvalued, and encourage you to please poke holes in my arguments. Tell me what I'm missing please, particularly re. the path to profitability and the reinsurance topic.

**Basics**

* Lemonade says it's an insurance company that leverages AI to price risk better.
* Lemonade claims to "disrupt" the insurance industry by using AI, implying all others don't.
* Lemonade has a do-good attitude, borderline arrogant, to all of its marketing. This appeals to quite some folks primarily in the U.S., as their growing client numbers show.
* The company was recently discussed by a bearish outlet called "the friendly bear", and by Citron. The Friendly Bear article is worth a reading imo, the Citron video was absolutely weak and didn't attack the company meaningfully.
* From what I can tell, customers are either extremely happy or extremely disappointed with the company. The former are mainly - not only! - the ones that never submitted a claim and only experienced the sign-up process. My research is limited to reading reviews on the app store.

&#x200B;

**Bull case**

* Lemonade's AI capability: If LMND does manage to use AI to price risk better than its competitors, this could result in lower loss ratios. However, note that AI typically needs a lot of data points; data points LMND has just started collecting. Heavy reliance on AI also reduces salary spending and should lead to low costs of adding incremental customers.
* Target demographic: Below 40 year olds, due to hipster-oriented marketing and your phone being the only distribution channel. The idea is to grow alongside those customers.
* Doing good: Parts of earnings go to the lemonade foundation and from there to charities pre-selected by policyholders.
* Founder: Founders have founded and grown firms previously (Fiverr).
* Growth potential: LMND is rapidly expanding its insurance offerings, having most recently started to offer pet insurance, life insurance.

**Bear case**

* Use of reinsurance: LMND cedes 75% of risks, and 75% of premiums received, to reinsurers. I think this is the main red flag here. Superior AI should allow them to underwrite only good risks, meaning they need less reinsurance - not more - than other insurance companies. The 25% ceding commission they gain is a small drop, it means they cede "only" 56% of premium, not the full 75%. Note that in addition to ceding 75%, they use even more reinsurance to manage the remaining 25% - meaning they probably retain about 20% of risk - and premium - themselves.
* Use of reinsurance 2: The S1 (July 1, 2020) announces the plan to start ceding 75% starting in Q3. So one quarter after going public, the company dramatically changes it's business model for it's core business which is providing insurance. This is suspect to say the least.
* Slight risk of misstating the truth: (Disclaimer: I can't judge as to whether this is illegal, nor do I want to enter that discussion). However, I believe that a) They might not actually pass the litmus test for being an insurance company. They are, at the moment, not more than a broker for reinsurers, that earns about 20 cents for every 1 dollar in premium.
* Political risk: The charities one can select do not resonate with less liberal folks, according to app store reviews.
* No path to profit visible: GWP in 3Q20 was 71.2, but ceded written premium was 118.6, resulting in NWP of -47.4. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased. Both is a result of the heavy reinsurance use. The gross earned premium figure in the 3Q20 can't be reconciled with prior quarters and the company presents gross earned premium of positive 42.9, but then another 32.4 are ceded to reinsurers, leading to revenue of only 17.8.
* Use of AI most likely overstated: a) The firm has no significant R&D spending - "technology development" is an own line item (5m in Q3) but it's four times less than sales and marketing, and half that of G&A. This is clearly not an indicator LMND invests massively into its AI capabilities. Rather they seek to push top line. b) If AI is so good there would be less need for reinsurance because the AI would be capable to weed out bad risks. Instead, LMND uses a shitload of reinsurance.
* Planned share issuance at 165$ - then at the all-time high, they announced the offering. A smart move that will bring in cash they need to grow (think advertising). And an indicator that mgmt thinks the stock is currently overvalued.
* Abroad growth is slow: In Germany, LMND is a very tiny (think <1% of market) player according to news by competitor wefox and by other articles. In France they won some lawsuit about the use of the color pink, but I haven't yet found any data on their market share there, I assume it's negligible.
* The company's stock price started jumping once the stock was a suggested buy by motley fool. Motley fool regularly issues bullish articles on the stock. In addition, the firm seems - to me - to be actively marketing its shares through social media like tiktok. This sheds in my view a very dubious light on the firm.
* Lack of insurance experience by chief executives. While they have succeeded founding companies and taking them public in the past, they have no insurance industry experience. I see this as a major red flag in such a complex industry.

**My main issue / stuff that prevents me from going all-in on my bearish bet:**

* No obvious catalyst visible that could trigger a big drop in share price - I'm afraid that if they keep growing customers, as top line grows, so will the stock price. I'm afraid investors see this as one of the only few "hot new stocks" in the insurance segment, leaving little alternative to investing if one wants to be part of innovation in insurance.
* Side note: Timing-wise, one problem might arise in 3 years when they will have to renegotiate the 75% reinsurance agreements. If their AI sucks, then their risks are not above market average, and if that's the case, reinsurers might raise premium / reduce ceding commission. I see this as one potential catalyst, but it's far in the future.

**Positions currently held, albeit with medium conviction only, and planning to hold at least after Q4 release:**

* 2x LMND Feb 21 (Feb 12 expiration) 120P, currently worth 232$

The technology is solid and there is a need for that they are doing. Redwood Materials, also ex-Tesla is also one to watch for when they go public but $ABML has a lot of upside and a cheap entry point.

Recycling batteries will be critical as there is only a finite amount of lithium and likely not enough lithium to fully electrify the world. Not to mention recycling heavy metals such as cobalt because let’s face it NMC cathodes aren’t going to be replaced for a long time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Vanguard ETFs and Sector Spreads I was recently told ( from another Vanguard investor ) that any portfolio index over 10% in each sector through 8-10 Vanguard ETF’s is inefficient and not diversified enough to mitigate risk in this current climate.  The sector spreads are never that straightforward without carryover. 

Disclaimer - I laughed and whole heartily disagree.

I’m curious as to what the consensus is from others here who primarily invest in the Vanguard funds. Do you strive for even spreads or do you lean in and over index?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Potential Investment in Rolls Royce Holdings (RR) I have recently jumped at the chance to purchase some Rolls Royce Shares, As of the past couple of weeks/ months this stock has been drastically underperforming so much so that the price is now very cheap per share, another thought is as soon as (if) planes start to operate the share should rise. I also have seen a couple of articles/ news about Rolls Royce being awarded military contracts for some naval ships in asia (not confirmed but seems likely). sure they are shoring up assets at the moment but they have a big bank to sit on. just like Carinival Cruise Lines (CCL). Of course I am open to those with other views, but this seems like a free one at this price

Summary  - Cheap stock, lots of assets, possibly a significant gain in future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Suncor energy earnings tomorrow I am long on Suncor to start off, but I want this discussion to stay unbiased.

Edit: Prices are Canadian dollars as I initially wrote this in r/Canadianinvestor , but being listed on the NYSE as well, it would be great to get other insights.

I can't understand how the current share price is still under $22? They are an absolute giant with mountains of cashflow, yet seem detached from the rest of the energy market. With the current price of oil hovering around $55 and likely on it's way to $60 ( http://ca.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-this-trading-pattern-shows-oil-is-heading-toward-60-200446695 ), does anyone have any insight?

Suncor has stated openly that oil @ $35 covers costs and dividends. We have been above this price thoughout the quarter. With an average price target around $28-$30 and strong possibility of dividends increasing with tomorrows earnings report, it seems like a no brainier right now at current prices.

Look no further. Athersys (ATHX) is an American biotech company based in Cleveland, Ohio. Athersys’ claim to fame is going to be it’s line of MAPC stem cells, MultiStem. These cells are believed to reduce inflammation after major injury, leading to better outcomes (lower death, increased quality of life) following a major event. Athersys has a strategic partnership with Healios, a pharma company in Japan, whos CEO is a beast and is really pushing the research and development along.

1. Stroke - Prior to COVID, stroke was the 5th leading cause of mortality in the US. More than 140,000 people die each year from stroke in the United States. Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. Each year, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke.

Let’s discuss current treatments for stroke. Is it a hemorrhagic stroke? Blood pressure management and prayers. Ischemic? A crap clot busting drug, TPA, that can only be given 3 hours after initial symptoms. Did I mention it can also cause lethal bleeding? See [https://rebelem.com/ischemic-stroke-treatment-archive/](https://rebelem.com/ischemic-stroke-treatment-archive/) for full details.

Currently, Multistem is in enrolling two Phase 3 Trials for ischemic stroke, TREASURE  (sponsored by Healios) and MASTERS-2 (sponsored by Athersys) and has Fast Track Designation from the FDA. TPA, the only current treatment for acute ischemic stroke, was approved on terrible data. The bar for approval has been set SUPER LOW, giving MultiStem huge opportunity, as it can be given up to 36 hours after initial symptoms.

1. Acute Respiratory Distress SYndrome (ARDS) - remember when this was all the hype with COVID? Well there’s still no good treatment. ATHX mooned around this time and was on track to receive a boatload of funding from BARDA, as they deemed Multistem “highly relevant” for the treatment of COVID. However, the BARDA director, Rick Bright, disagreed with Trump about pushing meds without evidence, and got fired ([https://www.biocentury.com/article/304972/bright-was-fired-from-barda-for-resisting-demands-to-disregard-science-on-covid-19](https://www.biocentury.com/article/304972/bright-was-fired-from-barda-for-resisting-demands-to-disregard-science-on-covid-19)).

Currently, ATHX is conducting a Phase 3 trial (MACOVIA) for the treatment of COVID ARDS, and has Fast Track and RMAT Designation by the FDA. Healios is conducting a separate Phase 3 trial for general ARDS (ONE BRIDGE), which has potential for future pandemics and all other causes of ARDS (trauma, pancreatitis, infection).

1. Trauma (MATRICS-1) - As if stroke and ARDS aren’t enough, MultiStem is currently being studied by the Department of Defense at UTHealth for the early treatment and prevention of complications after tramatic brain injury (TBI). This study is early phase 2.

Short Interest - this stock is primed for a short squeeze. At a current whopping 12.9 days to cover

However, if they can make it the next year or two with cash burn they should 10x._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DoorDash, or how venture capital has subsidized cheap tendie delivery Much has already been written about the valuation of DoorDash following its IPO last December, including Citron calling it 'the most ridiculous IPO of 2020'. I have compiled my thoughts here for some DueDash on DoorDiligence.

I should also note that both GrubHub and Uber report earnings this week (Feb 3, and 10th, respectively), so that should provide some insight on whether my near-term predictions hold. As of this afternoon's earnings report, Chipotle's digital orders decreased 7% from the previous quarter.

**TL/DR: DoorDash is a nonprofit organization that teaches math and financial literacy to delivery drivers.** This is a company that is overvalued by a factor of 2-6x, yet can't make money during a pandemic where people are locked in their homes and in-person restaurant visits are banned.

### Bull thesis for DoorDash:

- COVID-19 pandemic continues longer than expected, or US doesn't vaccinate 60%+ of populace by EOY 2021
- Strong revenue growth over the past 2 years. "Contribution profit" (non-GAAP) is slowly increasing
- Rapidly increased market share, and may continue to do so
- Subscription model, strong sales/total users compared to GrubHub (despite lower sales/transaction)
- Ghost kitchen model?
- Last-mile delivery logistics focus


### Bear thesis for DoorDash

- Doordash is vastly overpriced compared to its competition, and that competition will likely further drive down margins/take-rates and commoditize food-delivery. 
    - DoorDash has the lowest take-rate (revenues/gross order value [GOV])
    - Uber has a somewhat profitable/EBITDA positive ride-share segment, that will likely recover post-COVID. Uber also just expanded it's delivery business with the purchase of Drizzly (alcohol)
    - GrubHub has actually been profitable in previous years

|Company|Market cap|TTM GOV|TTM Revenues|Take rate|P/GOV|P/S|EPS (9mo)|Sales/User ($)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|DoorDash|58,380|19,007|2,214|11.65%|3.1|26.4|-3.34|123|
|GrubHub|6,910|7,860|1,657|21.08%|0.9|4.2|-0.96|55|
|Uber|95,490|57,905|10,631|18.36%|1.6|9.0|-3.33|136|

|UberEats (35%)|33,560|24,568|2,962|12.06%|1.4|11.3|n/a|n/a|

NB: I split up Uber market cap 65/35 to get a better idea of how to potentially value UberEats on its own

- Lack of a moat and no brand loyalty: a [large percentage of customers use multiple apps](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EG-mealdelivery-charts-December2020-competitive-analysis-1024x523.png), and there is significant [geographic competition](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EG-mealdelivery-charts-December2020-MSA-1024x635.png) across the food-delivery companies.
- Significant future legislative/regulatory risks around employee classification
- Lock up period ends in mid March, after the first earnings release (Feb 25) – and then **113M shares, purchased at an average price of $8.73, will be available to trade on the market**. Average daily volume for DASH is 4.4M shares/day. Stock price has rapidly reached $185-200 level, but has hit 140s before.
- Increasing revenues are due to the pandemic, and will likely decrease in the future - DoorDash has not been proftable, even during COVID-19. 
    - Personal disposable income, and increased off-premise food purchases are likely the primary drivers of DASH’s revenue growth quarter/quarter
    - Lifting of COVID-related restrictions, and abatement of stimulus funds will likely bring [personal disposable income](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&nipa_table_list=58&categories=survey) and [off-premise food purchases](	https://rallyforrestaurants.com/impact-COVID-19-restaurant-insights.html) back to 2019 trends 
- Long-term, these apps will likely turn into last-mile delivery/logistics companies. Yet, FDX and UPS also trade at low P/S ratios (0.86, and 1.69 respectively, with 60 and 135B market caps)

**DoorDash is priced as if it has both 100% of the market share for food delivery, and that food deliveries will not decrease once the pandemic has ended.**
As you can see in the chart below, both personal disposable income, and off-premise food and beverage purchase ("OPFP"). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic stimulus, both measures drastically increased in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, before starting to level off and decline. I suspect that we will see a decline back towards 2019 levels - if we eventually get a significant portion of the populace vaccinated and withstanding additional stimulus checks. Once we're out of this mess, everyone and their mom will be wanting to eat out at restaurants, not order food to eat the one place they've been trapped for the last year.


[Here is a chart I put together overlaying data from food-delivery companies, and economic data](https://i.imgur.com/z5H5rvm.png) that I hope illustrates this point.

Let's run some projections based on off-premise food purchases (data from [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&nipa_table_list=58&categories=survey)). We will look at positive, neutral, and negative projections for DoorDash, in terms of what share of total OPFP they procure, and whether they can increase their take-rate. 'Bear case' here is a longer-term projection if things return towards 2019 levels

||Bull case|Current (Q4)|Bear case|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Off-premise food (billions)|1150|1138|1025|
|Share of OPFP (bps)|75|63 (*)|30|
|Projected Q4 orders (millions)|8625|7169|3075|
|Take rate|13%|11.7%|11%|
|Projected Q4 revenues (millions)|1121|839|338|

(*) Consensus revenue estimates by analyst's project $938M in revenue, which would be a 0.70% share of OPFP. Q3 2020 share of OPFP was 0.63% for DoorDash

If we valued DoorDash like we did its competitors, its market cap would be: (using projections from previous table)

|...if we valued DoorDash like we did (millions of $):|Bull|Current (Q4)|Bear|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Currently (26 P/S)|80,088|72,641|59,441|
|UberEats (12 P/S)|36,447|33,058|27,051|
|GrubHub (5 P/S)|15,186|13,774|11,271|


**I believe a strong, bull-case valuation is realistically somewhere around $29B - this puts us at $90/share**

-	Let's assume total food delivery gross sales stays at 2020 levels of $60B/year, and DoorDash captures 100% of the market. This gives us 6.6B revenue, and a 28B valuation at ~4x P/S
-	Let's assume total food delivery gross sales gradually decline (~8% q/q) over 2021, and DoorDash maintains its current market share. This provides $3.5B in revenue over 2021 (still, a significant bump over Q3 2020 TTM revenues), so even an 8x P/S valuation puts us back at 28B
-	$29B is also close to the current and bearish projections for food orders in the above table, given an UberEats-like valuation

**A more realistic, long-term valuation is probably about 50% lower - around $60/share**

RIDE went public a few months ago its traded at $24usd right now. Their backed by gm and have contracts with LG along with owning the old gm warehouse in Ohio.

Lordstown (Ride) also already has 100k preorders for their ev trucks that are pushed for commercial companies. They estimate the end user will pay $52k for the truck.

Their starting beta testing in a few weeks or possibly right now. (did a quick google and one caught fire... GREAT START). However tesla has had this issue before also.

Now the company hasn't made it to the "make it or break it" stage. They estimate 33k trucks will be made in 2022 and it'll double every year. Gm has also announced they'll be stepping into the ev game and has something like 28 EVs by 2024.

Kodak’s  sprawling 1,200-acre  complex in Rochester and experience the “city  within a city” that would  be at their disposal as clients. “They always  walk away impressed with  the scope and the caliber of the  organization,”

What they see are  extensive chemical production assets that have been  maintained with a  blue-chip corporation’s care. Three buildings at the  site house 88  multipurpose reactors in sizes of up to about 1,000 gal.  Kodak also  touts extensive solid-liquid separation capabilities and a  huge solvent  recovery section with 25 distillation towers.

Bill  Scott, a longtime chemical industry executive who has been  working  with Kodak to bring in new business, vouches for the quality of  the  Rochester site. “I’ve been in many, many chemical plants all over  the  world,” he says. “Their facility ranks with the very best.”

Also  at the site are the 300 or so Kodak people associated with the   chemical operations. Roughly 15% of them are involved in research and   new-product development, and most are long-tenured Kodak  employees who  know the ropes and get the job done without a lot of fuss._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unity (NYSE:U) Big Upside vs. Big Multiple [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402766-unity-software-valuing-digital-world-of-tomorrow](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402766-unity-software-valuing-digital-world-of-tomorrow)

Unity Software ([U](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/U?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) presents an incredible opportunity to own a cutting-edge software engine that is setup to be a large player in the digital world of tomorrow. Unity also trades at a massive valuation of \~40x estimated 2021 revenue. The following analysis compares the value of Unity's upside optionality with Unity's optimistic market cap today to see if there is still room for the stock to grow.

## What you should know

Unity sells a real-time 3D content creation system (an advanced application to build videogames) to creators which is deployable to 20 platforms (game systems) called Create Solutions, which comprises [\~30%](https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q320-Investor-Presentation-FINAL.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of revenue. Unity also sells various monetization and product optimization tools to Create users and other creators called Operate Solutions, which comprises \~60% of revenue. Unity has capitalized on the growing market demand from both individual creators and studios to create and deploy content with minimal friction or capital investment. Unity also has strategic partnerships with operating systems, consoles, and various notable firms, comprising \~10% of revenue.

Create Solutions is a sticky, subscription based model with over [1.5 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) monthly active creators. This model has extremely low churn due to the training required to use the system, but also has lower growth due to very fierce competition. Operate Solutions provides a service for the end creation, and is mostly based on usage. Thus, Operate Solutions has the ability to scale very quickly with gaming growth, and grows as game usage increases. Unity has achieved tremendous growth as the gaming market has continued to explode over the last decade, with an LTM dollar based net expansion rate (“DBNER”) of [144%](https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q320-Investor-Presentation-FINAL.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).

## Upside Opportunity

The gaming market will continue to grow throughout the 2020s, but Unity's c-suite has emphasized that its focus is on growth in the non-gaming market. Unity is used for a variety of non-gaming projects today, including construction simulation and planning, architectural projects, automotive design and simulations (used by [all ten](https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q320-Investor-Presentation-FINAL.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of the largest auto companies today), and film and animation ([Disney’s Lion King](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), 2019, was built on Unity). The non-gaming market for Unity today has barely been punctured, with only [8%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of Unity customers spending over $100k being categorized as non-gaming customers.

Future non-gaming demand will come from the continued transformation of our lives into a more virtual world, blogs typically refer to this with the popular catch-all phrase: the “[metaverse](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/the-s-1-club-unity-is-manifesting?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).” This path is paved by continued disruptive innovation in areas such as in-home technology and entertainment, transportation, retail, and the overall increase in the usage and capabilities of technology in our daily lives. This is the most exciting and risky part of the bullish thesis: the imagination and creativity associated with the non-gaming market capture add tremendous upside as well as heightened risk. As we’ll find out below: the gaming upside is mostly priced in. It is very difficult to try to value something that doesn’t really exist today and may not exist in ten years. The following approach attempts to value the optionality of the non-gaming market to corroborate the existing and more predictable cash flows from gaming-related operations.

## Valuation

Let’s say Unity’s estimated 2020 revenue of [\~$750 million](https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2020/Unity-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) grows by \~30% in 2021 to around $1 billion (within reason, \~42% growth in FY2019, estimated 40% in FY2020, in line with reasonably decaying DBNER). Unity is trading at a $40 billion market cap today, implying a 40x multiple on 2021 revenue (no outstanding debt).

## Okay, another ridiculous SaaS multiple. How do you justify that?

Let’s figure out how much Unity has to grow before a perpetual exit multiple is achieved, and then we can look at the non-gaming market.
