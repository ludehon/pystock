 Reminiscences of a Stock Operator: The Evolution of the Average WSB Autist **TLDR:** Alan Greenspan called this book "a font of investing wisdom" famous quotes such as "bulls and bears make money; pigs get slaughtered" originated from this book.

This book is a true story of how one boy leveraged 100-to-1 and successfully became a millionaire many times over. He buys a yacht, takes lavish vacations, and eventually has enough money to influence market movements.

*‚Ä¢ 1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the bid‚Äìask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at bucket shops.*

This is where your average WSB autist starts. Robinhood is essentially the modern day ‚Äúbucket shop‚Äù where people buy and sell stock based on tips they hear as well as crude technical analysis tools. Instead of 100-to-1 leverage, we use options.

*‚Ä¢ 1910-1920: Livermore was a stock trader on the New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.*

Even the great traders of our time lost it all more than once. The most useful lesson is to trim down your leverage and do not ‚Äúrevenge trade‚Äù. You need to stay in the right state of mind at all times. The moment you start thinking ‚ÄúI just lost a house payment‚Äù it is too late. The money in your account needs to feel like points in a game. It is much better to play the odds and lose on the right play than win money on pure luck.

*‚Ä¢ 1920s: Livermore engaged in market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.*

This is where the big dogs are now. Read this section and learn how the market manipulation works. It was the same back then as it is today. Large players will test the market, find resistance, and manipulate the price to sell into retail strength. A lot of posts on this sub are part of pumping and dumping stocks. Remember that you are following the Big Dogs to tendies, and you need to get out before your favorite meme stock leaves you bag-holding.

**Positions:** 100-to-1 leverage on GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When did you start getting this right? I‚Äôve been trading since the end of September. Two months in, been up 3k, down 3k, etc. As soon as I feel I‚Äôm on the right path, I‚Äôll fomo and lose days of gains in minutes. Although, I feel like my instincts and emotional controls are getting better, I‚Äôve been close to cutting my loses while I‚Äôm ahead...

Here is why A lot of Cathie Wood simps are investing their life savings into Nanodimesnion without doing any DD whatsoever. I've seen some clueless investors comparing NNDM to the next Tesla, NIO and even apple (WTF??). Even after they‚Äôve had 7+ direct offerings this year valued over 200mil. They wont let it drop. The truth is that NNDM only has one shitty product for sale on the market and it is extremely niche. They have a market cap of 400mill and only had 400,000 in revenue this quarter (yes you read that correctly) putting its price to sales ratio at roughly 120+.  After earnings, which showed revenue dropped 80% year over year, the stock ran to new all time highs. Why? Because of Cathie Wood's simp army.

The worst case scenario he laid out is that one major company can go down and create a domino effect in the market. It's unusual for Softbank to be bearish because they are known to buy billions of dollars of call options  in big techs, which drives up the prices significantly. He didn't disclose how Softbank arrived at that scenario.

Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.

Stop thinking they are going bankrupt anytime soon. Just paid $125M of Debt EARLY.

Cohen, who owns almost 10%, just sent a letter to Management via the press calling them out for a dramatic transformation. The letter doesn't say it directly but is implied that if you don't do it I will force it to happen.

Huge Short Interest - I am not calling out a Short Squeeze (although that would be epic). An good piece of news will be the match lighting the fuse.

Fair Value of GME - $20-25/share. Buy shares and watch them double in the next 30 to 90 days. Buy calls on any dip.

This guy bought some calls for this AES stock with almost zero liquidity. He then wrote a DD here 5 days ago. I have been tracking the call volume and the open interest for that stock for the last couple of days. Open interest increased significantly after his post but the stock price decreased which created a lot of greedy bag holder including himself. He bought 10 calls with strike price of $21 expiring today, at $0.35 cost basis, which are currently trading at $0.05 (expiring worthless). Another 13 calls expiring on Dec 18 at cost basis of $0.65 are now at $0.5 with barely any volume. On top of that he was encouraging people to buy $22 strike ones!

CHGG announced incredible Q3 numbers but lowered guidance going forward on the premise school shutdowns would not continue into Q4 and the covid vaccine would send students running back to the classroom. The stock fell from ~$87 to $66 and is now floating around 71.

NY, CO, MN and many other states have school districts announcing school shutdowns for the winter/spring which will extend through Q4, something management may not have accounted for in their conservative guidance. In my uneducated opinion I don‚Äôt see the vaccine being mass distributed until late Q1 and the earliest but I don‚Äôt know shit about this.

I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the company but I do think short term tailwinds for the stock will drive the price back up to the 85-90 range.

This is not a üåàüêª post, but rather a cautionary tale and reminder to secure those gains before they evaporate.  With COVID closures increasing throughout the country and increasing disagreements in the White House, things could get very messy going into the holiday season.  Thanksgiving is next week and the markets will be closed while many are stuffing their faces with turkey and spending their blood dollars on Black Friday.  People will undoubtedly  travel for this and visit stores, against health expert recommendations, to spend time with loved ones. 

This will exacerbate the spread of covid and increase the rate of closures.  Congress and JPowell are divided on helping those affected by COVID and,  Mnuchin asked the central bank to return some $455 billion in unused funding for programs set to expire Dec. 31.  This is money to help people and businesses deal with financial difficulties and it is being cancelled.  

I know what's going through your mind, how about Moderna and Pfizer emergency vaccine approval?  Well that could take up to a few months to happen, maybe by Spring.

Again, tread lightly and good luck this holiday season.

https://preview.redd.it/sqvv9p0gxe061.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d9ff5d8e9e9129760aabeb22cd9f2a0a77a3715

For those of you that have any class or style, then you probably eat UTZ products and you don't even know it. Here is a list of their brands. 

https://preview.redd.it/otmgldhlxe061.jpg?width=890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9db05fb128c17d3c228aac89020fbe8b5bdb9c8

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On top of all these brands, UTZ just made a tortilla acquisition that will contribute another \~200M in revenue and 50M in EBITDA. Once this deal closes, UTZ will be the third largest salty snack manufacturer in the U.S.A. With Campbells soup being #2 (I don't  even know what cambpells makes) and Frito-Lay being numero uno. The acquisition is a tortilla and tortilla chip manufacturer named "on the border."

&#x200B;

My personal favorite utz product: [https://www.amazon.com/Zapps-Orleans-Kettle-Style-Potato-Voodoo/dp/B01LY46L19](https://www.amazon.com/Zapps-Orleans-Kettle-Style-Potato-Voodoo/dp/B01LY46L19)

&#x200B;

As you can see, they have a huge amount of regional brands that are growing and have been growing for over 100 effing years. That is right, UTZ has been in business for 100 years and has grown every single year. Every single year?????  The salty snack category grows 3-4% YOY but UTZ has been growing  much quicker. In their most recent earnings report, UTZ grew 24% YOY.

* UTZ MAKES HAWAIIAN BRANDED CHIPS - THESE THINGS ARE THE BOMB SHIT

* UTZ JUST ACQUIRED ON THE BORDER CHIPS WHICH WILL ADD 200M IN SALES AND 50MD EBITDA
* RECENT PRICE TARGETS SHOW POTENTIAL OF 25%+ UPSIDE
* This is an under followed company- it went public through a spac and is just getting wheels.
   * There are outstanding warrants but they can be called shortly.
* UTZ makes ZAPPS chips, these are also the bomb shit.

UTZ is becoming a household product as it has been slowly entering more and more US homes. According to their most recent earnings, they increased sales to US homes by about 1.7M homes YOY.

AS THEY EXPAND, THEIR PRESENCE AND ABILITY TO SCALE WILL IMPROVE.

I've been a lurker for a long time now but decided to pop that cherry for this post. 

Apollo is buying Great Canadian Gaming (ticker GC on toronto stock exchange) for $39 per share. The stock went up to $39 on Nov 10 and they had their earnings call on Nov 11. **This is a dead deal. **

On this earnings call, the major shareholders on the line rejected this and you can hear it all in this recording. You should listen to it for entertainment because it gets ugly. Skip to 29:00 min for when the shareholders speak up.
https://gcgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/Audio-file-Great-Canadian-Gaming-Corporation-Third-Quarter-2020-Results-2.mp3

**Summary of why the investors are against it:**

 GC didn't run an auction process for this offer. This means that they did not go out to other parties to see if they could obtain a better offer. The CEO said they ran a process around 2 years ago but nothing recent.

 Starting to see some light with casinos reopening and the vaccine news from the last few weeks. Selling now is practically selling at the bottom when things are just starting to turn around.

 GC has been buying back shares over the last few years. Just a few months ago before covid hit, they were planning to buy back $500M of their shares at a value of 46 dollars which resulted in their share prices shooting up to 45 on February 10 - 11 when that news released. This means that the CEO does believe there is tremendous potential for this stock to grow in the future.


**What we know**

They will be having a shareholder vote for this deal on Dec 23. The two largest shareholders in the company have already announced that they will reject this deal if you just look at this article.¬†https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/apollo-rebuffed-great-canadian-gaming-205759088.html

They own 31.5% in total. This does not count all the other investors that spoke up during the earnings call who all voiced their opposition to this deal.

Here is a video of an interview with another minority shareholder. Skip to 55 min to see him talk about what he has learned from other investors. Everyone he has talked to will reject this deal and he mentions that the combined ownership of these people is close to 50%. He also says that for the deal to go through there will need to be 65% of votes for it. From these numbers this is already a dead deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdyEAe0rvn8&ab_channel=YetAnotherValueChannel

I don't think I need to say much more to this as you guys should already know what to do at this point. Put options on great canadian gaming expiring Jan 2021. These are going for cheap but beware that it is quite illiquid. If this thing crashes back to the 20s when the deal gets rejected, we can all expect a huge payday.
Do your own DD.

TLDR; Buy GC puts expiring January 2021 because this deal will likely be rejected by the shareholders. My positions: GC 38p / 36p 1/15/2021

2. Extreme mistrust of food authenticity in China. Branded foods, medicines, etc. with clear origins are popular. BYND as first movers cements their brand.
3. Health conscious foods (Traditional Chinese Medicine foods) and mock meat (via Buddhism) has a long history.
4. BYND already tested in KFC/Starbucks across China.
5. Shanghai, where the BYND pork has debuted, trend sets for China. Their factory is also in Shanghai with teams on the ground testing flavor profiling to match consumer preferences.

If you aren't familiar, Skillz is a  platform that helps game developers monetize their games much faster and at greater scale than the usual models (advertising and in-game purchases) via the app store.   They do this by leveraging everyone's favorite activity -- GAMBLING!!

They provide a platform for creating tournaments, head-to-head competitions and most importantly allowing for cash deposits and cash payouts to winners.  They have timers in games to keep them to 5 minutes or less and some other social hooks to drive the addiction factor.

They call it "Casual eSports"

There are the usual categories of head-to-head games you can find in the app store -- word games, puzzle, sports, card games, etc.  Except all can be played head-to-head and for real money.

Today they claim to have:

* Over 30M players
* Over 20k developers creating games for their platform
* Over $60M in Monthly payouts

They just reported earnings this week with revenue up 92% year-over-year and they are just in the early stages of growth and platform exposure.

Stock is at $13.50 a share and roughly a 1.3B market cap.

The play here is Feb and May OTM calls. Or covered calls.

I'm in for FEAC 2/19/20121 15C and FEAC 5/21/2020 15C and 17.5C

The bet is that analyst coverage starts to increase as their market exposure grows and platform expands.  Retail investor interest will also increase when they change the ticker symbol to look more like the company name.

It's a little early for these guys, but not a stretch to see this being a 3x-5x play by February.  Understood not the 10-banger in a week most people on this sub like, but worth a look.

Here we go! 

Emerson Energy. Your grandfather probably has this stock in a safe somewhere. This is the company that sold the first fucking electric fan in the 1800s. What are they doing now? Industrial temperature monitoring.

Why is this a big deal? You know, COVID shit.  

Little brains are investing in Pharma. Bigger brains are investing in HVAC‚Ä¶. But the real move is in temperature monitoring. COVID vaccines need to be kept cold. Damn cold. 

Emerson makes products **and services** to monitor temperatures throughout the supply chain. This *had* been used mostly for food; if your Wendy's baconator popped over 43 freedom units in temp during transit (always fresh, never frozen), that's bad news. *Now*, there's a ton of monitoring potential in the new vaccines. 

Trump says the military is going to distribute this. Will they? Who knows. But SOMEONE has got to move this shit around, and someone needs to know for sure that the vaccine hasn't gone hot while the driver was getting serviced by some lot-lizard at a Flying J. 

Big potential here as they start moving this shit around. 

So where else are their monitoring services popping up? Medical Labs, Hospitals, and Senior Centers.  Anything else they're doing? Yep; they're also manufacturing medical masks, gowns, and filters.  

EMR stock is currently at $75. EMR 82.5c 12/18 is under a buck. Same for EMR 85c 1/15. 

Add to this, EMR is just a solid company, too. They've beat EPS estimates in all of their recent earnings announcements. They've been around for over 100 years, and they don't really show signs of weakening. The stock still hasn't quite returned to its pre-COVID levels, so even if you don't believe they're about to moon, you could still expect a small gain as they return to where they were in January.

And the way companies in the sector make money has changed rapidly over the years.

With new consoles from [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) and [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=6758.T-JP) [on sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/15/microsoft-looks-beyond-the-console-wars-with-new-xbox.html), there‚Äôs a clear push from both companies deeper into software and subscriptions ‚Äî similar to the way [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL) has placed a greater emphasis on services in recent years.

&#x200B;

[üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/microsoft-sony-nintendo-how-video-game-console-industry-is-changing.html) <‚Äîforgot to add the source, I'm not that smart to write up such a post when I'm in GME and here's your rocket

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They‚Äôre hoping to capitalize on [rising demand for games](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/video-games-sales-soar-as-coronavirus-leaves-millions-trapped-at-home.html) as consumers around the world spend more time at home during the coronavirus pandemic. But a viral pandemic isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôs changed the gaming industry recently.

According to Daniel Ahmad, analyst at Niko Partners, consoles are now a much more profitable business for firms like Microsoft, Sony and [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=7974.T-JP) than they were a decade or two ago.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now moving to a point where hardware is profitable, software has always been profitable and network services are playing a much larger role in keeping people within the console gaming ecosystems,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs ‚Äú[Beyond the Valley](https://www.cnbc.com/beyondthevalley/)‚Äù podcast.

Digital distribution of games has allowed firms to rake in bigger profit margins than selling physical copies in stores, Ahmad said. Whereas publishers would traditionally make about $35 on a $60 game sold in-store, online downloads mean they can now make as much as $45 per game.

Sony and Nintendo [have reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/nintendo-q1-earnings-profits-surge-428percent-animal-crossing-sales-double.html) much higher digital download numbers this year. That trend looks likely to continue, with both Microsoft and Sony selling digital-only versions of their new consoles at lower prices.

## Ecosystem

So-called gaming ecosystems are set to become even more important over the next few years. Microsoft, for example, is betting heavily on building out its player base across a range of different devices, including its Xbox consoles, Windows PCs and smartphones.

The company [released its xCloud gaming service](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/microsoft-xcloud-release-for-android.html) commercially in September as part of its Xbox Game Pass subscription platform. Cloud gaming lets users play a game that‚Äôs streamed to their device from a company‚Äôs remote infrastructure. Such services are typically available through paid subscriptions, similar to [Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=NFLX) but for games rather than TV shows and movies.

‚ÄúWe think of the console as something that is always going to be part of gaming, because what it does is it effectively gives someone the flagship experience,‚Äù Sarah Bond, Microsoft‚Äôs corporate vice president of gaming ecosystem, said in an interview for ‚ÄúBeyond the Valley.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the other thing we‚Äôve seen ‚Äî and there really has been a rise in this over the last 10 years ‚Äî is people wanting to game across devices,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúSo the console plays that role as part of an ecosystem where people can actually game anywhere.‚Äù

Japanese rival Sony, meanwhile, is pitching the PS5 as an all-in-one system that gives players access to its exclusive games as well as its PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now subscriptions services, which offer online gaming, some free titles and cloud gaming.

Analysts say the PS5‚Ä≤s predecessor, the PlayStation 4, largely beat Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox One console due to the number of exclusive games it sells. Sony‚Äôs in-house studios have produced several popular franchises, such as God of War and The Last of Us.

**The ability for games to generate huge amounts of revenue over the long term is going to be really important to a lot of these platform owners.Daniel AhmadANALYST, NIKO PARTNERS**

Nintendo similarly takes advantage of its vast catalog of intellectual property, with series like Animal Crossing and Super Mario selling [multi-million hits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-and-coronavirus-led-to-record-sales.html) on its Switch console.

The company stands out as it‚Äôs less concerned with Microsoft and Sony‚Äôs next-gen console battle, choosing instead to ride a wave of continued demand for the Switch. However, it hasn‚Äôt missed out on the rush toward subscriptions and services, using its paid Nintendo Switch Online feature to drive additional sales from software.

## Big Tech

Now, other tech giants are stepping on gaming companies‚Äô turf. [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL), [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) and [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB) have all released their own cloud gaming services, looking to carve out a share of the $160 billion games market.

Niko Partners‚Äô Ahmad said there are two main strategies coming out of Big Tech: On the one hand, Google and Amazon are trying to compete with the likes of Steam and Epic Games as digital game distribution platforms themselves. On the other, Facebook is using game streaming as an advertising tool.

‚ÄúHow that works is, you‚Äôre scrolling through your Facebook feed and you can instantly jump into and experience a game,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you like that experience, you can click to play and play more on the device of your choice instantly. In consoles, you can do that through instant demos; download a game instantly without downloading it.‚Äù

For now, cloud gaming is mainly seeing adoption among console gamers who want to continue playing the titles they enjoy on other devices, Ahmad said. It‚Äôs going to be an opportunity for tech companies of all stripes to take advantage of the growth in mobile gaming, which now accounts for almost half of the entire market, according to Newzoo.

Microsoft, a company valued at $1.6 trillion, sees cloud gaming and subscriptions as a chance to drive more users toward its content. The company recently bought Bethesda Softworks, the video game publisher behind hit franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, for $7.5 billion.

‚ÄúContent is key to people driving our gaming subscription, and it‚Äôs something that people look for,‚Äù said Bond, who added that Bethesda‚Äôs content would help ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù growth of its Game Pass subscription service.

Ahmad thinks there could be more consolidation on the horizon: ‚ÄúThe ability for games to generate huge amounts of revenue over the long term is going to be really important to a lot of these platform owners.‚Äù

Moderna's vaccine needs to be below 20'C and Pfizer at -70C. Who will make the refrigerants for 500 billion doses?  -> Companies like Linde. 

And who may transport these, Gist Limited, also owned by Linde.

Quick question about options trading. When I buy an option, which e.g. expires on Dec 1st 2020, am I only allowed to sell it on that date, and does it happen automatically? Could I sell it earlier?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JMIA is hot garbage and you should short it immediately Listen up degenerates, there is a huge shorting opportunity forming and it's name is JMIA. For those of you who don't know, JMIA is the alleged 'Amazon of Africa' by people who know absolutely nothing about the difference between Amazon and JMIA and probably even less about Africa. The stock has seen just an absolutely stupid run up in the past month (\~60%) and is prone to extreme volatility anyway, leading me to believe JMIA will correct imminently if not in the next few months.

To make this digestible for you morons, I'm going to break this into 3 parts: (1) why the African market is super challenging, (2) why the future is looking even grimmer, and (3) why the company is dog shit.

**The** **African market**  
So for those of you who have only a cursory grasp of a world existing outside the US, it may come as a shock to you that Africa is not in fact a country and it is not in fact one market. In reality, Africa is many countries - 54 to be exact (depending on who you ask). And apart from being 54 countries, Africa is also probably >10x as many 'markets'.

Why you ask? Well, African countries happen to be some of the most culturally and linguistically diverse on the planet. In Nigeria alone (JMIA's biggest market), there are easily over 10 major languages, many of which are associated with different 'ethnic' groups in different regions of the country that, had they been left to their own nation state evolution instead of subject to colonially imposed border drawing, would have almost certainly been separate countries.

In addition to being a highly fragmented market landscape, African countries boast some of the lowest literacy and numeracy rates in the world (google it yourself) and they are not improving very quickly. This makes it quite hard for a smartphone based app that depends on people reading and using the internet to actually grow their user base even if population is growing rapidly across Africa.

Finally, the infrastructure is shit in 90% of JMIA's core markets. Some of the worst roads and logistics chains you can imagine are there, and the vast majority of countries in Africa don't even use physical addresses. You can imagine the long-term challenges that a delivery service might face in these circumstances.

**The future**  
Covid is not doing any favors to the economic climate across the continent either. Unlike the US and the EU, African countries rarely have the luxury of providing stimmy money and running the printer. Inflation and government debt are already extremely high in the majority of JMIA's core markets, so trying to stimulate economic demand is not in the cards.

Furthermore, a huge chunk of these economies is dependent on demand from the US, China, the EU. If the demand dries up there, it just gets passed down the line a few months later.

**The company is dog shit**  
This is perhaps the most-compelling reason to short the stock: the company just isn't that good. Sure they're in a challenging market with a bleak future outlook, but they just aren't up to the challenge at hand (few are by the way).

To illustrate this point, take a look at their recent developments and their numbers. For one, they have *exited 3 separate countries in the past year.* Exited. As in gave up, weren't up to the task, called it quits. You may look at that and say 'well that's a good sing; it just means they're concentrating on their more profitable markets'. To which I say, um no, it means they have shitty market intelligence and entering countries they know fucking nothing about and have to abandon ship.

In terms of their numbers, they leave a ton to be desired to say the least. Much of their growth over the past few years has been squarely on the back of incentivizing the shit out of people using their platform and incurring large losses as a result. Late last year, they decided they would be doing less of that and as a result their numbers have shown it: Q3 numbers show both GMV and number of orders were down vs. 2019. And keep in mind, this was all during Covid when when most e-commerce platforms have been booming.

**\*\*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\*\*\***  
This stock has seen a stupid amount of FOMO in the past few months and is prone to extremely irrational and baseless spikes. I can't discount the possibility of this going back up to IPO levels before people waking the fuck up. Be careful about the momentum, but recognize that like 90% of retail investors in JMIA have no idea what the fuck this company actually does and what the African market is like. It will fall once the momentum runs out.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** JMIA's core markets are hugely challenging places to operate that will not be changing anytime soon and JMIA is a shit company that has missed the Covid tailwind. Its stock is hideously overvalued and it will go back under $15

&#x200B;

**TL;DR of TL;DR** 15p 1/15/21_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR - long term play or hype train 2 zee moon?   

'Allo mes amis 

I threw some spare change at this company early on (euros of course, none of your colonial monopoly money) and got some reasonable growth already. 

is this a long term play for you chaps or more of a speculation? One argument i hear is that there are other companies doing the same thing more profitably who can take market share from them.

My take here is that pltr is becoming more entrenched in the security infrastructure and this will help them organically grow their business in this space so everyone in 5 eyes/nato etc is talking the same language (so to speak). I'm quite bullish here. let's also bear in mind that relationships will play a role here.

Private sector-wise we've heard/read all the stuff about BP and the airline company saving loada millions in 5 minutes. There's more competition in this space all the way from free power BI for tiny companies to more powerful solutions from providers like salesforce (tableau), cognizant, splunk. I'm less bullish here but if the product is as good as they say then they should gain traction here over time. This last bit's super important. Any insight here would be great.

In terms of business model you have sticky revenue and sticky clients who probably don't want to redo  their software every year. Probably a relatively long sales cycle and it's b2b not b2c - i'm curious to see the q4 results.

Putting this altogether this seems like more of a slow burning value play than something that will spike short term. Anyone see this differently?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QFIN tomorrow?

Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.

&#x200B;

Tech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.

Seriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling.

&#x200B;

The M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).

&#x200B;

Could licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.

&#x200B;

Seriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.

Now in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time?

&#x200B;

Also where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.

It looks like the Chinese govt might be taking a protectionist posture with regard to the EV market in China. I think strategically this makes sense. They have targets to hit per the Paris Agreement, and Transportation is part of that. Also, as we both know, China is thirsty for oil, and to the extent they can reduce demand for it within their transportation sector, the more liberty/freedom they might enjoy internationally. Viewed from this angle, the $1bn investment seems shrewd and opportunistic. It also looks protectionist.

Technicals

1. SPCE has been trading near the top of the last parabolic move since a couple of weeks ago. It pulled back a little and formed two new support levels. It has formed bullish patterns in multiple time frames - a bullish flag, ascending triangle, and a upward trend that hasn't been broken since the last parabolic move.

2. This stock is strong as fuck, the recent economic turmoil hasn't affected it a bit, it is still following the trend line and continues to consolidate at the top while slowly creeping up along the upward trend line while consolidating.

3. Last Friday it has just formed a higher low in the consolidation - a buy set up and it is safe to buy!

4. 25% of the stock float is short.  When it breaks out of $20, they will get squeezed along with all the catalysts in the coming months.

5. Morgon Stanley has a target price of 60.  They say hypersonic travel  will have an $800 billion dollar total addressable market by 2040. SPCE  is at the head of the pack in developing the technology to enable  hypersonic point to point travel, so they could very well be a  disruptive force in this future industry.

Judging by the title itself it doesn't seem like a big deal, after all, its only $455bil but I'm gonna break it down for you people as to why you should start to SERIOUSLY consider buying UVXY calls or SPY puts (I know, super gay). 

Since the start of the pandemic, one of the key programs set up by the FED is its key lending facilities. These facilities were set up to cover virtually ALL aspects of the credit markets from corporate debt to credit cards. Pretty much any debt that can be securitized, these facilities were set up so that the FED (through their SPVs) can purchase these CDOs or ETFs and provide liquidity to the credit markets and raise investor confidence. Now, the only way the FED can continue to purchase these debt assets is if the Treasury continues to support the FED by providing funds to cover any potential losses the facilities may incur ([https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus)). The amount of money the Treasury can provide is stated in the CARES act and is $455billion dollars, the same amount as stated in the title.

Right now, Mnuchin is pulling that amount from the FED and is therefore refusing to extend the lending facilities past year end, which means the market now knows that the backstop they enjoyed from the FED since March is running out and the confidence they had that the FED will support virtually all corners of the credit market is now shattered. Even if Mnuchin only wants to pull the plug on 5 of the nine facilities, it wouldn't matter because investor confidence is now gone. 

Expect yields in credit markets to rise and VIX to spike. We might even have a minor replay of March.

TL;DR: Trump is stabbing us in the back by sending Mnuchin to kneecap the FED's ability to print.

This is just my speculation but I believe the public is overly optimistic about vaccines and how the subsequent distribution and logistics will pan out. I'll keep my DD short and sweet.

# The Race between the 4 Biotechs:

**Pfizer (PFE)**:

* 95% efficacy
* 2 dose
* 50 mill doses to be produced by the end of 2020
* Must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit)
* Submitted to FDA for Emergency Use Approval (optimistic timeline for approval = end of 2020)
* People with special licenses can administer the vaccine shots

**Moderna (MRNA):**

* 94% efficacy
* 1 dose
* 20 mill doses to be produced by the end of 2020
* Must be kept at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit)
* Hasn't been submitted to FDA for EUA yet, but getting documentation prepared
* People with special licenses can administer the vaccine shots

**AstraZenenca (AZN):**

* Currently in Phase 3
* Expected to release data by the end of 2020

**Johnson&Johnson (JNJ):**

* Currently in Phase 3
* Expected to release data in February 2021

# Relative Pricing and Comparison

**MGM Resort International (MGM):**

* \-14% pps of pre-covid levels
* Occupancy rate 44%
* Revenue: -68% vs last LYQ3
* Negative EPS
* 25% employees terminated

**Other Industry Leading Boomer Stocks**

* CCL (cruise) = -57% pps of pre-covid levels
* AAL (airlines) = -54% pps of pre-covid levels
* SPG (mall) = -42% pps of pre-covid levels
* JWN (retail) = -48% pps of pre-covid levels
* LVS (casino) = -18% pps of pre-covid levels

**MGM is inflated compared to the other boomer stocks as it's very much near pre-covid levels.**

# Macro factors

A sub-premise of this post is that whatever brough MGM's stock price to what it is today was artificial and it isn't reflective of a healthy incline. The volume popped off per vaccine news, but now the volume has significantly dropped at the current levels. Buyer power is at its tipping point and a single bad news can easily trigger a large sell-off as the good news have now all been priced-in. But what will trigger the sell-off?

# The Sell-off Triggers

* **The relief bill's benefits is all set to end on Dec 31 (this includes** **government bailouts).** We were expected to make stimulus negotiations post-election, but both sides aren't looking to work with one another. Other analysts predict that productive negotiations will only resume once Biden is in office which is in January.
* **Rising COVID cases.** US COVID cases hasn't yet peaked as we continue to set new hospitalization and case records every day.
* **Thanksgiving is cancelled, but maybe even Christmas and New Years celebrations, too.** Hotels&Resorts are one of the greatest attractions during Christmas, but it seems like we're going to stay in lockdown.
* **Vaccine Distribution&Logistics issue.** As mentioned, countries and states will continue to face big challenges in vaccine delivery. One logistic issue in the headlines can induce great amounts of fear triggering sell-offs.

**Conclusion:** In the short to medium term, there are no news that awaits for hotel&resort stocks that points bullish. The buyer power has peaked and now, they are headed for a big correction.

**Position: $MGM 26.5p 12/31**

**Proof:**

[$MGM 26.5p 12\/31](https://preview.redd.it/xgs0r6y57a061.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb68260641e1c756e3f1ba981e6cfa415b7381a)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Get rid of lockdowns in 14 days here is how Lockdowns are based on positive test rate which if you know anything about the virus it is extremely infectious after 10pm and at restaurants unless you are eating inside a tent that is outside. 3% > is the metric they use which is super low and allows them to implement a lockdown. This virus isn‚Äôt going away if it‚Äôs as contagious as it‚Äôs made out to be which means infectious rate will always be around 3%. So how do you get rid of lockdowns and pump tf out of the market with great news.....STOP GETTING TESTED. Just like you can‚Äôt have an std if you don‚Äôt know about it, you can‚Äôt be positive if you don‚Äôt get tested.
