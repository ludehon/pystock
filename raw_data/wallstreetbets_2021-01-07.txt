Also I think their upcoming rebrand will move the needle as well.

I know you guys think pharma is tapped but the market is assuming it will be gone this year, news to the contrary may be coming out soon as they study the new variant. This could turn to a seasonal flu like situation, I don't think Covid is going anywhere.

NYT article from 2018, some interesting content:

“If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion — a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations — his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion”

“Mr. Musk’s critics — and there are many — are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company’s latest publicity stunt.”

Elon contended, “I actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.”

There you go, TSLA to be a trillion dollar company, probably even faster than Papa Elon predicted.

This gives it a price to book ratio of about 2.57 compared to Tesla's 108, you're really getting second to none VALUE!

So, air filtration/hvac/home improvement commercial/residential play on Comfort Systems ($FIX).

They just crested their ATH and stock is now in the ether and floating at around $58. Now look at the chart.

1/15/21 60c looking good to anyone else? 

Not a lot of options traded on this one, but 1/15/21 is turning into a weekly of sorts—setup for next week.

True price is currently like $0.40-$0.60 for the call (not enough bid/ask action to see real price).

Anyway, $0.50 risk for $3.00+ upside on calls if underlying could hit $63 by next Friday.

Trane (TT) had performed strongly, but FIX is comparatively unknown (TT been printing for me since summer).

It’s a fairly simple play—but infrastructure spending is good here for FIX as they’ve a lot of commercial exposure, and we get to play the air filtration/hvac angle along with infrastructure spending.

Downsides? Not enough volume on this yolo to get out: if it goes the wrong way, it’s over.

But I dig the play for a 300%+ return. IMHO, you run this play one hundred times and it returns markedly more than it loses.

Premiums are super low and IV on any strike/date is under 20%.**

**Who is ABB?**

ABB is a swiss/swedish robotics and automation company that works on EV charging stations and green energy solutions.  ABB is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability™ digital platform. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 147,000 employees.

&#x200B;

**They've been in the EV game since 2010 and just opened a new $30 million facility for creating chargers.**

>As a global market leader in e-mobility solutions, the $30 million investment in this new facility is further evidence of ABB’s continued commitment to driving innovation in this fast-growing sector. It follows a $10 million investment in a new fully sustainable, global e-mobility headquarters and Research and Development (R&D) center built on the TU Delft Campus, Heertjeslaan, Netherlands which is set to officially launch later this year.  
>  
>The new plant will produce ABB's entire portfolio of direct current (DC) electric vehicle battery chargers, from domestic systems to systems for installation in public areas and those dedicated to urban public transport. It will also help to further support ABB’s growth and innovation in the e-mobility sector.

**Along with a $10 million facility for R&D**

>Designed to spur further innovations in e-mobility, the $10 million, 3,600 sq m facility is based on the Delft University of Technology campus, in the Netherlands and will drive ABB’s future portfolio development, as well as R&D projects for EVs. The University was ranked among the top 15 engineering and technology universities in the world in the QS World University Rankings in 2020.  
>  
>As part of this investment, we are focused on pushing the boundaries of e-mobility, predominantly in the areas of charging, storage and digitalization. The new lab will allow us to strengthen our collaboration with EV manufacturers to drive further performance and progress across the sector.”

**They also spend $400 Million on R&D each year.**

>Muehlon says: “Within ABB Electrification, we invest approximately $400 million per annum into R&D to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological leadership and set the standard when it comes to sustainable mobility.

This vaccine is a total game changer, especially with the logistics and administration problems we’re seeing across the US. The single dose is a cheaper cost per vaccinated person, and eliminates the requirement for hospitals to track patients for vaccine types and 2nd visits. 

The vaccine is also storable at standard refrigerated temperatures. This will make it easier to transport, handling, and a viable options for for countries / communities without ultra low temp freezers.J&J’s vaccine will no doubt be preferred over 2-dose, ultra cold stored alternatives.

AMD. Ya heard of it? No, not American Mini Dicks, thats your 2nd favorite subreddit. I'm talking Advanced Micro Devices.   


What does AMD do? They make CPU and GPU's. What do those do? Well without computer processors, you wouldn't be able to yolo your life savings on OTM options, and your wife wouldn't be able to send nudes to her boyfriend.  GPU's are cool too. Right now NVDA is making the best GPU's. But AMD is 2nd best! NVDA is currently trading at 529.78. That's pretty good. But AMD is only trading at 94.95!   


I know that youre thinking little buddy. If AMD is making the 2nd best GPU's, shouldn't they be a little closer? That's right retard. But there is more.   


AMD makes CPU's too. Those are rad. In fact, AMD is making some of the best processors in the world right now. That's a big deal, CPU's are used in everything. Probably takes some really smart nerds to make those. Not anybody can do that.   


Intel is falling behind in the competition, and AAPL is starting to make their own CPU's. That leaves the rest of the market for AMD.  Surely lots of companies (HP, Dell, Lenovo) will want to use the BEST (AMD) CPU's in their desktops and laptops. And they are already trending that way. Some of the best computers you can buy right now have AMD processors. That's right, your favorite porn machine might have an AMD processor in it right now.   


YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS AN AMD CHIP IN IT?  


EVERY XBOX SERIES X AND PLAYSTATION 5. That's right. If you didn't waste your stimmy on one of these consoles, your wife's boyfriend probably did. And if he didn't buy one for himself, he probably bought 2 or 3 for your kids. Theyre everywhere. These things are selling out everywhere, and we all know it. The processing power that allows you to look at those sweet cyberpunk tits is all thanks to AMD.   


But what gives? AMD is in every Xbox and PlayStation, their stock hasn't moved much since those releases..  


That's right, youre getting it! Lisa Su is gonna drop a big fat bomb on the shareholders this month during earnings, letting everybody know that they made millions. (Probably)  


AMD is undervalued.

#_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We gonna moon for earnings. Get on board. TSLA to $1K _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All aboard the LION bus: Why NGA is in a distant P1 for EV busses Was reading a day old post about NGA that talked about some pretty bland stuff and realized nobody understands the company as I do. 

One thing, and the largest thing the OP failed to mention, and the reason I bought into this stock with a good % of my portfolio, is that Amazon purchased a good bit of LION and reserved a % 
 of lions capacity for its bus order to AMZN through the next couple years.

You might think ok well it’s just Amazon seeing if they can poach another good company in its infancy but not really. This is a strategic cost savings plan for them that allows them to purchase a company and expense that money later. Think integration. 

Why? Look into Amazon’s bus contracts in major cities. Almost nobody knows that Amazon spends ~8 figures a year in many of the cities it operates in to bus its employees to and from its FCs at no cost to the employees. Sometimes they do it because it’s agreed to for tax exemptions, other times because they’re nice (and rich) like that. By purchasing EVs they’ll get sooo many more benefits though. With equity in the company they’re buying from a % of profit flows back to them.  Emissions credits to offset their FC costs, and they can expense all the bus purchases and operating coats to offset FC income, effectively enabling them to offset the purchase of the equity in LION through FC expense. Not to mention the major capital injection to an early moving EV company, once cities see these Lion busses everywhere they’ll be like hey, great idea, and now because Lion is already producing at scale to support the AMZN order, their busses are competitively priced and they can break even or make money on the product while other companies are operating at a loss. 

It’s a brilliant deal for them when you consider everything. And it enables LION to scale up risk free.

China has just announced a province wide shutdown of Hebei due to more than 200 new COVID cases in the last week. Why is this important and what does it have to do with the steel gang? Take a look at the ranking of steel production by region below:

1. China excluding Hebei Province
2. Hebei province China excluding Tangshan City
3. Tangshan City, Hebei China excluding production under reported in Tangshan City

4-8  Japan, USA, India, Russia, Korea

9. Production amount under-reported in Tangshan City

10. Germany

Why would they under report production in Tangshan City, you may ask? Because China is trying to reduce its steel output as the industry itself creates a shit ton of pollution. As part of China's made in China 2025 strategy they are trying to move all these low end manufacturing to places like India and Vietnam so they can upgrade their industries.

TLDR: China just shutdown the province that produces most of the steel in the world due to 200 new COVID cases last week. Steel stocks will  🚀🚀🚀.

Chuck wants to buy a 50% share in Sneeds Banana Stand. Chuck asks himself, what is a reasonable price to pay for half of this banana stand?

If Chuck paid $500 for half of the Banana Stand:

* Total Banana Stand market value: $1000
* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* Price to profit ratio (P/E ratio): 2.73
* Time to recoup his $500 investment: 2.73 years

Chuck is willing to take on a little more risk than this. Hell, this Banana Stand really shows a lot of promise! And Sneed, well, Sneed is like a genius! He had a great Banana Stand over on the other side of town that sold tons of bananas. What if Chuck paid ... $25,000 ?

* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* P/E ratio: 137
* Time to recoup his $25,000 investment: 137 years.

Chuck doesn't expect to hold his investment for 137 years. He believes that what's really important is not the money coming into the Banana Stand, but rather how other people like Chuck *feel* about the Banana Stand. See chuck is a growth investor - not a value investor.

Chuck feels really good about the future of this Banana Stand. It's only making $1 a day right now, but man Sneed is going to take this Stand places. Chuck decides to go all in and pay $289,080 for a 50% share in the Banana Stand.

MRNA was in a 3 week downtrend and broke trend about 3 days ago.

&#x200B;

SPAC has very limited downside and huge upside potential. If no deal, all shareholders will be returned $10 after the 2-year deadline. Now, the most painful part about betting on SPAC is that you never know when a deal will be announced... But there are rumors that will bring up the stock price.

&#x200B;

For IPOF, it's almost guaranteed that a deal will be announced very soon. This is what Chamath, the owner of IPOF tweeted before Christmas:

This deal has to be IPOF because IPOE was reported to be merging with SoFi today. Both $DM and $MP's deal sizes were $250m and $350m so it's VERY unlikely to be IPOD.

The CEO there and it's being pumped pretty intensely by GM. GM's current options are the Bolt and it's selling incredibly well.

" Sales of the electric Chevrolet Bolt jumped 26.4% to 20,754 for 2020 compared with 2019 and the brand has "very aggressive goals in 2021 with both the Bolt and the Bolt EUV," Majoros said. The 2022 Bolt EUV compact SUV will be on the same second-generation Battery Electric Vehicle architecture as the Bolt."

You take a look at the option chain, and there is incredible levels of call buying deep down the chain. The 48 call has massive volume. That's over an 11% increase in appreciation in a week. Granted, that's probably retail, but the point stands. It is wildly speculated that they are going to introduce a completely EV Silverado, which is it's most popular car. Best of luck out there.

**Earnings** \- [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aqh0bpkatZYkciY7YA4lH8hq3BQ?e=GA4hvF)

Earnings for Q3 were very solid. If you reference the above link, I've shared details into VALE's Q3 earnings. There's a few key takeaways: 

* Reference the Avg Prices tab and see what VALE got in Q3 for each commodity. For Q4, there's a few big winners we should expect: 
   * Iron Ore - up 30% in Q4. This is VALE's largest commodity and likely priced into earnings. It is 80% of their revenue. 
   * Met Coal - also up 30% in Q4. This is another huge line item for VALE and was a loss in Q4. At current prices, this will be an easy winner, but only 1% of their revenue. 
   * Copper - up about 20% in Q4. This is 5% of their revenue and drive about $500m in profits in Q4. 
   * Nickel - up about 15% in Q4. This is about 10% of their revenue. 
* VALE made $2.9b in Q3. That's about $.59/share. They have a 3.9% dividend to go along with this. 
* Production was up over Q1 and Q2, but depressed since 2019. Some of this has been a result of declining ore quality and Covid. There was also a landslide that caused some production loss. 

**High-Level Research**: 

Okay - so core commodity prices are increasing. We also know that VALE sends about 60% of their product to China. So how does this translate? Here's where I explain why Q4 will be amazing, and how Nickel will be the catalyst for a massive earnings beat. 

* Iron Ore is super expensive, and we are seeing massive shipments being sent to China. China is so short on steel that they are buying scrap for the first time ever from Japan. Here's a series of articles/tweets to read: 
   * [Post 1](https://twitter.com/YuanTalks/status/1346356073309978624?s=19) \- Iron Ore hitting record high prices, but shipments falling
   * [Post 2](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020695-0501/WEEKLY--Aust--Brazilian-iron-ore-shipment-over-Dec-28-Jan-3.html) \- looking at shipping details, we see that VALE's shipments actually increased while iron from Australia fell. VALE shipped 6.5m tons of iron in the last week of the year - that's about $1b in revs in a week. 
   * [Post 3](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/) \- even though shipments fell in the last week of December, shipments are at all time highs. VALE is literally sending mountains of iron to China at record prices. Yay! 
      * Also note that the Baltic Dry Index is nearing highs too. Shipping rates are expensive and will hurt margins slightly. 

**Projections**: 

Okay - so Iron is going to be a huge winner in Q4. Right now, here's the earnings projections for VALE: 

* Low - $.5/share (about $2.5b in profit) 
* Medium - $.8/share (about $4b in profit) 
* High - $1/share (about $5b in profit) 

At Q3 output levels and current prices, we should expect to be near the high estimate of $1/share. Revs are expected at $12-13b, but should be much higher given current shipping details we've seen from VALE to China. At the worst, we have a Rev and Earnings beat. 

So why Nickel? 

**Thesis**: 

If you reference the Q3 Earnings Call - Nickel was the clear callout for VALE's earnings beat last quarter. You'll regularly see Nickel prices and sales being a major driver for increased earnings. 

Here's Nickel's [chart](https://tvc-invdn-com.akamaized.net/data/tvc_b0922c4db148b2c166ae2ff909d8183a.png): 

&#x200B;

[Nickel Futures](https://preview.redd.it/y36ns5ublx961.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d09c9901ac2abdb4914ae42fd17f097c4e069d2)

Nickel just broke out and is entering a massive bull market. Currently Nickel is trading at $18,000/ton, which is much higher than VALE's realized price of $15,000/ton in Q3. What's interesting is that Nickel is rising despite [rising stock piles](http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/lmewarehouse.html) in warehouses. 

Here's where we get a bit speculative - reference VALE's Nickel production here: [Link](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/quarterly-results/QuarterlyResultsDocs/PREREPORT3T20_i_vf.pdf)

Mining outputs are variable quarter to quarter due to weather, ore grades, demand, prices, etc - sometimes when bull markets or demand increases, miners turn on production that was previously on hold. We see that in Q3, VALE saw soaring demand for Nickel as it relates to sales, and this would be an indicator for a higher demand for Nickel. However, nickel output is actually down from 2019, when prices were at similar prices to today. 

With nickel prices breaking out and appearing to be headed much higher, VALE might have offline nickel production that they'll turn back on to take advantage of higher demand and prices. Additionally, nickel prices are looking like they might go significantly higher into Q4, and have a much higher price target than say iron or coal. We've also seen VALE buy miners in Indonesia for additional Nickel production, which is aligned with this ongoing Nickel breakout. 

**Prediction**: 

VALE's nickel output will return to 2019 levels and take advantage of the current pricing. We could see an additional 20m tons produced, and a massive profit line item on Q4. Additionally, if VALE can lock in these prices for Q4 and continue to increase production and see rising prices, Nickel could become 15-20% of VALE's business and bring in over $1b in profit a quarter. 

Based on an expected earnings/rev beat and future outlook for VALE, I'm expecting the share price to jump to $25-27 in March based on current P/E and other metrics for the stock. 

**Positions**:

Looking into a lot of analytics that I've had success with, I think that $GIS has a great option chance! Analyst and P/E expectations have turned positive which has led to a price increase of around 2% within the coming week. This has happened 5 times in the past which has led to 85% of those days resulted in an upward move in a week period.

\- The median move for the week is 2% and with GIS dropping early this morning is a great chance to buy it. My hit ratio for that comes in very high around 90%. I am in at a strike price of 57.5.

I've had a lot of success with these metrics but feel free to use or not use!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CLF and Hard to Borrow The short interest in CLF has been a story for years. 

In fact, shorts in the Cleveland-based steel producer goes back decades.  

LTV Steel (once a customer of CLF; now is owned by CLF) had the biggest bankruptcy in history that started in the late 80s, and there were retail shorts who sold more shares short than the firm had outstanding! 

Gordon Johnson/Axiom Capital had some legal issues related to defamation and CLF CEO, LG.  Same folks had a ginormous short position that just weeks ago turned bullish.

Naked short selling is illegal in some countries, and is a money maker for brokerages as they profit from interest they charge investors to borrow shares they don’t own so they can sell them in the hopes of buying them back for a profit.  Totally turns the zero-sum game of the stock market on its side. 

When there are a limited amount of shares available to borrow, brokerages form a list of stocks that appear on a list called “hard to borrow.”  

CLF has been on this list for quite some time, and continues to be. 

From Investopedia:
“A hard-to-borrow list is an inventory record used by brokerages to indicate what stocks are difficult to borrow for short sale transactions. A brokerage firm's hard-to-borrow list provides an up-to-date catalog of stocks that cannot easily be borrowed for use as a short sale.”

In my zen-like state of post-nut clarity, I figured I'd share a little DD I've been cooking up. About 6 years ago, I saw a little noticed the after the-bell earnings report for AMD. Back then AMD wasn't the OG millionaire printer they are today. They were a has-been boomer stock, that went up against Intel, lost big time, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. For almost a decade AMD was mismanaged, producing 2nd rate video cards and 3rd rate processors. They spent all their money and talent designing low margin chips for OEMs and one off projects (gaming consoles mostly) and spun off their manufacturing arm in a frenzied bid to stay afloat. But after this earnings report AMD jumped like 30%, from jack-shit to 30% higher than jack-shit. The reason for that is of course, Su Bae and her brilliant operational excellence. Anyone who took note of AMD back then is now rich as shit as the stock has climbed 30x since that little earnings report.
I could give you a history lesson about AMD, but this DD isn't about AMD. That ship has sailed and at best you're looking at a 2-3 bagger, complete with a massive implied vol on the options which would completely drown your gains.

No, this story goes back farther than AMD. Before Lisa Su was queen of the CPU racket, she spent a decade at a little company called IBM. The ones who made the Thinkpads your dad was using while getting a BJ from his secretary under his desk, real 90s shit. This was a boomer stock before there were boomer stocks.
So why the fuck am I doing a DD about IBM? Because this is the year it all turns around for IBM.

I could go on about IBM trades at a 14.5 times P/E and has a 5% dividend yield, but that's the opposite of what you want to hear. Don't worry, they keep making less money each year, so that sweet boomer dividend will be gone before you know it.

IBM is spinning off their legacy business that makes all the money, but is making less of it each year, and their Redhat/AI/Cloud business into two separate companies. Now if the market weren't full of Chads who only want to see y/y earnings growth %, having a free second cash cow business that paid the dividend while your AI and Cloud business grew would be seen as a good thing. So if you have IBM when they complete the split, and you can ditch the dividend shares if you want.

Now some 🌈🐻 think IBM can't turn around because their legacy business is declining. But IBM is now on the path towards competing with Microsoft and Amazon. They bought Redhat, which every tech company uses. They have analytics, they have quantum computing, they have ai/machine learning, they have blockchain, and they're making "hybrid-cloud", which is just part cloud, part onsite, which governments and companies with sensitive information will love. Something Microsoft and Amazon don't do. Now don't get me wrong, IBM has been saying they were going to do all this for years, but last spring they finally put in a CEO who can steer the ship in the wrong direction.

Arvind Krishna, remember the name. The man has a PhD in electrical engineering and has been living and breathing cloud more than your baja hoodie wearing college roommate after a bong rip.

AMD grew quickly when they got the right CEO because they had all the infrastructure in place to be a big company. IBM is where AMD was 6 years ago except they're ready to transform back into a VERY big company.

All IBM needs to do is cut the stupid dividend, and start using that sweet cash flow to buy up other tech companies. They need search, so companies like ESTC are big potential acquisition targets, and they need edge networking, so they could easily acquire a company like NET or FSLY. Once the market realizes what IBM is in the process of becoming, they're going 🚀🚀🚀.

Made a little dough. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the ENPH for 2021🚀 Hope you listened last time - Still lots of room for huge gains - warrants, calls, commons This is my second post for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. Hope you fuckers listened last time  
   
\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn’t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word

Hopefully you listened to me last time:  
 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\_and\_energy\_alternative\_is\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)

You probably didn’t and chased some shitty call option that failed.

At the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.

You’re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). 

Yesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.

Motley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  
 [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)

I know you won’t click the link to read it but here is the important part  
 

*Indeed, Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*

*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be the small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*

Best part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. 🚀

If you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates… rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.

Funds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF’s and index’s. 

IMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.

You can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.

P.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. This is ENPH for 2021 baby.

4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021

Mentioned:	MT RYI SC.HN ZEUS

The steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.

Moreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week’s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.

Reflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager’s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.

Meanwhile, the World Steel Association (“worldsteel”) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.

Separately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.

4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now

The outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry. This makes it a good time to invest in steel stocks that stand to benefit from this improved outlook. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

ArcelorMittal MT, along with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. The company sells its products to various customers in the automotive, appliance, engineering, construction, energy and machinery industries through a centralized marketing organization, as well as distributors. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 62.2% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. SC.HN recycles ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals; and manufactures finished steel products worldwide. Under the Cascade Steel and Scrap segment, the company provides semi-finished goods, which include billets; and finished goods consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rods, merchant bars, and other specialty products. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 52.8% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

Ryerson Holding Corporation RYI, along with its subsidiaries, processes and distributes industrial metals in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 35% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

Olympic Steel, Inc. ZEUS processes and distributes metal products in the United States and internationally. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 77.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA Numbers vs Competition & Stock Dilution If anyone has any sage analysis on APHA+TLRY vs the world post it.  I'm doing DD now and the stock dilution looks really bad.  15% in one year, not including the last 4 months.  Also Google has the market cap at 3b$ which doesn't make sense to me.  It appears factually wrong unless there was a another 1b$ dilution, which according to SEC filings I think there actually was!  If they issued $1b of stock, then the dilution is insane.

Here are the numbers for stock issuance per the quarterly filings.  I saw more recent filings on the SEC website:

p.36 [https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aphria-YE-2019-annual-financial-statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aphria-YE-2019-annual-financial-statements.pdf)

A question I can't figure out is whether a Canadian company can operate in the US.  TLRY luckily is incorporated in Delaware so maybe that takes care of the problem.

The debate about large Canadian companies vs multi-state operators is also interesting.

And it looks like APHA doesn't even mention recreational drugs in its presentations, so I dunno if they're trying to be a grocery store supplier or something.

What's crazy to me is that compared to APHA, all the other executive teams look weak as fuck._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ U.S. weekly jobless claims total 787,000, vs 815,000 estimate _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Today's Pre-Market Movers & News [Thursday, January 7th, 2021] #Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub!

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there “will be an orderly transition” of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, January 7th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME gang explains Ryan Cohen _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Schnitzer Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results 🚀🚀🚀🚀 FUCKING BLASTING OFF 🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | RUN, ENPH, TLRY, ACB, NIO, ROKU, CAT, F & Other Stock News [01-07] **Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot & Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small & mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why $QQQJ isn't done - YUUUUUGE POTENTIAL Tired of seeing ICLN and TAN posts and feeling FOMO because you missed the rocketship ETF? Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). 🚀🚀🚀

As expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.

&#x200B;

[Back-tested 1-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/0vpf5800yw961.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=209a318c5e67a98e8609022c2c2ffd6034485856)

&#x200B;

[Back-tested 10-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/nfmx41j1yw961.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=c232397f03f07eac82456b04bbdbbb5e008b2aa8)

Some of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:

* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)
* TTD (down 20% from December highs)
* BYND (down 18% from December highs)
* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)

Despite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.

The incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause an IV spike.

But won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.

# More confirmation bias:

Below is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ rocket confirmed.

https://preview.redd.it/lmn6ix83yw961.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=f278c0d3f7bf60b2676dda3f7421e703c7aedee0

# Charts

I've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).

[Rudimentary Bearish Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/jdhzylf4yw961.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b75e4174338e6161bf7467950f3512f840f3319)

Alternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:

# HERE'S THE KEY POINT

Some of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.

Premiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now.

Based on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.

100x June 35c 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BBBY Earnings Prayer Thread I didn't see that BBBY had an Earnings prayer thread and its a damn shame because we obviously didn't pray enough.

Reported Earnings: $0.08

Consensus  Estimate: $0.21

Earnings Whisper: $0.31

EPS Suprise of: -74.2% BIG OFFFF

 

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. on Thursday logged a third-quarter loss and a smaller adjusted profit than analysts had forecast, as the company's in-store sales declined during the continuing pandemic.     

E-commerce revenue grew 77% on a comparable basis, while comparable-store sales fell 15%.     

The Union, N.J., the home-goods retailer reported a net loss of $75.4 million,        or 61 cents a share. In the prior-year quarter, the company's loss was $38.6 million, or 31 cents a share.     

On an adjusted basis, Bed        Bath & Beyond posted a profit of eight cents a        share. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast an adjusted profit of 19        cents a share.     

Revenue was $2.62 billion, down from $2.76 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $2.75        billion.     

Bed Bath & Beyond attributed the decline in sales to its move away from noncore banners, and to store closures. The growth in digital sales continued a trend that has strengthened since last year as more people shopped from home during the coronavirus pandemic. The company said its core Bed Bath &        Beyond banner gained about 2.2 million new online customers in the quarter.     

Comparable sales grew 2% overall, it said.     

The company said gross margin improved to 36.5% in the quarter as the company adjusted promotions and markdowns, and achieved a more-favorable product mix. This was partially offset by high shipping costs as more sales involved sending products directly to customers' homes, Bed        Bath & Beyond said.

&#x200B;

PLTR will have many ups and downs. The key to diamond hands is conviction. This worked for Tesla and will work for any other stock.

The best way to form an opinion is to have two imaginary people take the opposite extrem limits of an argument and let them discuss, because the truth is somewhere in the middle.

In order to do that I want you to form the absolute bear case for Palantir.

Once an opinion gets ripped apart and still stands it become conviction, which makes it easy to diamond hand shares and/or options.

Why should you not invest in Palantir?

Why is it a bad company with no bright future?

What are your strongest arguments against PLTR?

No B2C? Scaling ability? Consulting heavy? Margins?

I am referring to the company model itself and its monetization not to the stock price.

I hope this post will not get removed and will create discussions outside of the nearly unmoderated pump and dump that is happening in the daily at the moment.

To clarify: I am very bullish on PLTR and expect a $200B marketcap in the future and will invest after the lockup period._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $XPEV hints at new sedan _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Weedstocks went bananas on GA runoff and looks great for 2021 Throw a dart against any weedstock yesterday and you would have made 10% (15% had the capitol not melted down).  And it looks to be carrying forward again today.

Dems now control everything and weed will be at the top of their agenda.  Why?  Because we spent 10T in the last 4 years and it's time we paid the piper.  They will tax the shit out of weed and it will be a multi-centi-billi-industry.  Capiche?

On top of which, the Dems are all about social justice and will want to decriminalize weed ASAP.  There's already 40+ states where weed is legal in one form or another.  Our neighbors Canada have been smoking it up legally for over 2 years now and Mexico is on the verge of legalizing (it will happen this year!).

For those just wanting to dip their toe in the water, go ETF.  MSOS if you want to play US MSO (multi-state-operators) and why wouldn't you.  They've been on literal fire all last year.   Or if you want to stick with Canadian LPs (Licensed Providers) that are licking their chops over the US market then MJ or YOLO is what you want.  For the wsb crowd, you can say you YOLO'd and still feel secure knowing you're in an ETF and not going broke like you would otherwise.

You want picks?  I got picks.  US players can only trade on OTC b/c of the whole federally illegal thing (stupid right??) but really anything is decent.  Curaleaf, Trulief, Green Thumb, Cresco Labs, Terrascend, to name a few.  My only qualm with US names (and it's a small one) is that these guys are already valued at multi billions, BUT they're all making money and so there's still very much room to grow.

On the Canadian side, nothing beats Village Farms in my book (only LP making money right now and that will probably stay true through all of 2021).  But CGC, APHA, TLRY, and even ACB ran up 10-20% yesterday alone (note: many are well shorted so some of that may have been squeeze driven but money is money so who cares?).  They are all chomping at the bit to get into the states (which presents some downside for MSO but the US will be a monster so plenty of room for everyone) and will go crazy WHEN (not IF) that announcement comes THIS YEAR (I'm calling it!)

Anyways, bottom line is:  GET YOUR ASSES into weedstocks RIGHT NOW or you'll be crying a river about how you missed the boat in a few months and we'll all be laughing at you while you serve us our mohitos._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boris gave me £2k and Argo turned it into £39k _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TSLA Bulls vs Bears: A WallStreetBets Story _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [Ready your Calls] Intel's Rocket Lake Desktop CPUs Will Arrive in March ''Motherboard vendor Gigabyte says its customers can expect Intel’s Rocket Lake desktop CPUs to arrive in March.

Interesting. We all obviously know it wont compete with what AMD has performance wise, but if it has a decent pricing on it, it might be interesting to short some calls on it.

before anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done

Man blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let’s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe: news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600

Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET 
with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).
