Obviously the time has passed us for very blatant price dislocation / easy money in preferred stock of companies with rock-solid credit, but does anybody do deeper dives or follow preferred stock market? I've seen some IG-credit companies with prefs trading below call price. Granted, they just may never call the stock (assuming its perpetual) so the appreciation isn't automatic (and in the examples below, isn't always significant), but a lot of the yields are 3.5-4%+ or higher, which nowadays I certainly wouldn't mind being "stuck with."

But with states consistently legalizing and decriminalizing, and now Mexico and the UN doing the same, the writing is on the wall for the US.

These two in particular are actually related to MJ, and though they are barely functioning at this moment, my presumption is that they will see a similar speculative-FOMO type major boost if/when MJ is legalized or de-scheduled at the federal level. 

And since they can be purchased for literal pennies (less than a penny for MSRT right now), it represents a compelling risk/reward gamble.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements(if any) and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    "Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    "Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders"
    
    Else

I'm aware that HSA money can only be used on qualified medical expenses before age 65 without penalty/taxes. However after age 65, that money (which was deposited and grew tax free for 30+ years)  can be used for any expenses, but it will be taxed as income.

Two questions:

1. If I have savings and pay out of pocket for medical expenses and save all receipts for the next 30+ yrs,  can I essentially use/turn in those receipts to make tax free withdrawals after 65 that I can use for whatever expenses I want? Then once I run out of those receipts, I would continue to withdrawal money from the HSA for any expenses but it would just be taxed as income. Is that correct?

2. It seems like you're technically allowed to invest the HSA money into whatever you want for tax free growth. Does this include day-trading options for huge tax free gains?

* **Luminar CEO and co-founder Austin Russell is poised to become a billionaire at 25 when his autonomous driving technology company Luminar goes public on Thursday.**
* **The lidar sensing technology company works with major automakers as well as Intel’s Mobileye.**
* **Elon Musk says lidar is not needed for self-driving, but Luminar has a $1 billion-plus book of business and relationships with major automakers.**

 

[Tesl](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA)a isn’t the only upstart auto industry player having a big year.

Luminar, which creates lidar technology critical to many automakers’ autonomous driving efforts, is going public on Thursday through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and the deal will make Luminar co-founder and CEO Austin Russell a billionaire — at the age of 25.

Russell, who founded the company as a 17-year-old high school student, said the feeling of becoming a billionaire (on paper, at least) is “absolutely incredible” and “totally surreal.”

But the Luminar CEO said it also follows the plan his company has had in mind since founding. “It is totally surreal and it totally makes sense and it is hard to explain the dichotomy of it, but this has always been the goal,” he said. “We set up the company to be a long-term sustainable business and power the future of autonomy for all of these automakers. We are in it for the long-term,” Russell told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday morning.

 Russell was a bit of a science prodigy.

“I guess, I did memorize the periodic table — I think I was around 2 or so,” [Russell told CNBC Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/thiel-fellow-austin-russell-founded-self-driving-car-tech-co-luminar.html) in a 2018 interview. “I was just obsessed with learning certain things ... just independently learning and understanding a lot of new types of scientific fields, among other things.”

That evolved into work on lasers and ultimately, lidar, which uses lasers to detect and measure distance and ultimately create a 3D map of the real world environment that can be used in self-driving.

He ended up at Stanford University studying physics, but dropped out and received a Thiel Fellowship, created by tech icon and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel to provide tech talent with alternatives to traditional education programs.

Russell said the company has a forward looking book of auto business at $1.3 billion and estimates its overall market opportunity within the multi-trillion auto market at “half a trillion” as lidar and autonomous vehicles come into focus for the auto industry.

Luminar works with automakers including Volvo, which is owned by Chinese auto company Geely.

While Russell said it can be hard for the market to value new technologies that lack existing market comps, he noted Luminar is working with [Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC)’s Mobileye, which also focused on [the future of autonomous sensing systems](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/intels-self-driving-leader-on-the-race-against-tesla-uber-and-lyft.html). “It’s cool to see back in 2017 they were acquired at a 43x revenue multiple of the business.”

Luminar, which made the 2018 [CNBC Disruptor 50](https://www.cnbc.com/cnbc-disruptors/) list, began trading under the ticker symbol [LAZR on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lazr) on Thursday, after its deal with SPAC [Gores Metropoulos](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LAZR) was completed.

## Elon Musk’s doubts about lidar

The Luminar CEO is not worried about lidar technology his firm has built become commoditized IP, saying the rise of this breakthrough technology is closer to what chip maker Nvidia does than a tech hardware company. “We have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage,” Russell said. “We’ve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other lidar R&D efforts combined.”

Competing lidar technologies include firms such as [Velodyne](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=VLDRW) and [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL)’s Waymo.

There is one notable doubter.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that [lidar is not needed for autonomous driving](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/autonomous-vehicle-pioneer-doubles-down-on-technology-trashed-by-musk.html) to work. “Freaking stupid,” were Musk’s words. The world’s newest billionaire, Russell, disagrees.

“I think 50 commercial partners and a majority of the major automakers we are working with would disagree.

I am an intermediate investor primarily dealing with swing trading over a week to a few weeks period.

I know there is no silver bullet trading strategy so I have been trying to work with the RSI-MACD double cross as it appeals to me. But, I'm having issues getting to actually work for me.

There are 2 parts to my strategy, the stock picking part and the actual trading part.

Stock picking:  
I am using 180 day candles. 9 day RSI (30/70). MACD (12/26/9).

I select stocks where the RSI is over 30, but was under 30 in the last 2 days.  
And, where the MACD has a bullish crossover but was bearish in the last 2 days.   
Both of these are to try and guarantee that the stock is rising.

The problem is that I get so few stocks being picked using this strategy. Maybe 1 every week or 2 will match my criteria and then it only runs up a few % and stagnates.

Trading:  
I buy identified stocks if they are under the 60 RSI and the MACD is bullish

I sell when the MACD turns bearish

In the talks about the second stimulus, I'm really curious to know where did the first stimulus officially end? If we take a look at FED balance sheet there was a huge surge from March 10 to June 9, followed by a small drop till July 7, at which point, it started growing again. What is officially considered the end of the stimulus? Is it June 10? And is the period from July 7 till the present moment considered "regular operations"? What differs "stimulus" from "regular operations" if both grow in size indefinitely, just the magnitude?

Beside the official stimulus which is huge in magnitude, how much can FED grow its balance sheet without "declaring" it a "stimulus", in other words, what are FED upside/downside limits without the consent of senate pertaining to growing/shrinking balance sheet in "regular operations"?

If we look at the period from 2010 to 2015, there was a constant growth. Was it considered a stimulus as well or just "regular operations"? While I understand that the wealth is being created and we need more money in the system, is it that the economy grew almost as much as 10 times from 2008, therefore requiring as much as 10 times the amount of the money in the system?

Can FED grow balance sheet another 10 fold in the next 10 years, therefore, the equities will simply continue to grow and everybody will be wealthier and happier or there are some repercussions? What should one be aware of and are the consequences?

Revenue shrank 11% from a year earlier, missing estimates for a third straight period. Some interesting information about who is recommending this stock:

* Ark immediately picked up 300,000 shares today.
* Morningstar examined the earning call and said the drop was due to pandemic and therefore maintained their price target of $208.
* Motley Fool's paid Stock Advisor service recommended this stock sometime in 2020. 
* Snowflake is trading at over 70 times next year’s revenue, while Zscaler and Zoom are priced at well over 30 times forward sales. Splunk’s price-to-sales multiple for next year is 10.

What does this company do?

* It offers enterprise cloud software solutions for information technology operations, security, internet-of-things, application analytics, business analytics and industries.

* **91 of the Fortune 100** companies are Splunk clients. For example, Splunk helps Dominoes manage the 15 digital channels its customers use to order Pizza. Splunk has been providing IT monitoring and application management for Zillow since 2013.

* Only 50% of Splunk's clients are on their cloud subscription service. But Splunk is aggressively trying to transfer all the business to cloud, and Morningstar says once that is done Splunk should be "poised for robust growth."

Caveats - The biggest caveat here is why did other data companies perform so well while Splunk tanked? One [analyst told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/zscaler-soars-and-splunk-tanks-a-tale-of-two-covid-stocks.html):

>the concern for Splunk is that companies are focusing today on buying technologies that are critical to getting through the current crisis. The third-quarter miss is likely due to “de-prioritization of analytics relative to digital transformation and security investments in response to COVID-19/WFH,” Turits wrote. Longer term, he said Splunk remains “the de facto machine data platform standard,” and he still recommends buying the shares.

What do you think? Is 20% a good discount for this industry leader?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dopamine and Serotonin in Investing Note: I originally posted this on r/dividends so the writing caters more towards dividends but can be applied to general investing. Mods hope that’s cool!

I occasionally lurked the dividends sub and one thing I noticed was how many stocks are in people’s portfolios. Throwing most of your money into 30+ random companies after googling “dividend kings” or “stocks with the highest dividends” is not what dividends are about. Dividends are passive income in form of passive investing. When you pick stocks you get a shot of dopamine. Dopamine is the “reward” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we want more; yet every substance or behavior that releases dopamine in the extreme leads to addiction. You try to motivate yourself to constantly seek out that next dividend stock to add to your portfolio. You assume your picks can beat the market gains. This generally leads to a general depression of dopamine which is anxiety. You’re constantly checking your portfolio, your emotions get the best of you which clouds your judgement and you make some wrong picks. That “king” cut its dividends and now its price has pummeled, your REIT no longer manages its buildings because there is no foot traffic, international ends up performing better next decade. There’s a reason why they say people who pick stocks don’t end up beating market returns.

On the flip side, serotonin is the “contentment” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we don’t need any more. You’re invested in broad index funds. You don’t give a shit who increases/decreases their dividends or who goes bankrupt. You look at your portfolio maybe once every few months. While this is sound, the pressures of today’s society has made us actively seek receptors that makes this extremely difficult. You’re making progress but it’s slower than you imagined, you’re bored. You’re watching strangers on the internet make hundreds of thousands from just one play. You decide to ditch the course and go onto another path to end up losing it all.

Now that we’ve discussed dopamine vs serotonin portfolios here’s my personal take. My first year investing included stock picking, chasing yields, and high-risk get rich quick plays in a dopamine portfolio. After losing some of my hard earned money, I eventually switched to a serotonin portfolio consisting of exclusively index funds. After I reached my first 100K between my 401K, Roth, and taxable I decided to do the math and I seen that I would still retire a millionaire if I kept maxing out my 401K and Roth every year with a 7% return since I started young. I’ve decided to use an approach where work income would go into my serotonin portfolio and income from bonuses or side hustles would go towards my dopamine portfolio. Spend a couple years grinding my ass off to build that dopamine portfolio. Got promotions, purchased a rental, delivered food, drove people around, etc. You’d be surprised how much money you can make on the side as long as you put the work in. I will knowledge that I had no social life at this stage of my life since I was addicted to making money, hence the dopamine so it does come with some drawbacks on your mental state. Fast forward, now I’m sitting comfortably with a 200K+ portfolio. A majority of it is primarily in index funds, a couple thousand for day trading and options, and shares in Apple and Pepsi. Looking to add JPM soon! I’m very selective when it comes to individual shares. Not only do they have to have a dividend, but I have to support the company enough to where my minimum investment is 10K. I understand the risks of stock picking and if I lost my money, I’d be more devastated in the company not performing well/going under because I value them. I think this creates a good balance between dopamine and serotonin. You get the boring, old reliables and you also get the hot shots who can help you reach your goals faster as long as you don’t let them come too close to the sun. I personally think people should not pick stocks unless they have reached the first grueling 100K but it’s your money. Do your DD and decide what aligns with your goals. My hopes were to introduce some science behind investing to new and veterans. I’m currently earning 4K almost 5K in dividends every year with 2%+ yield. As you can see I don’t chase yields. If my portfolio consisted of primarily high-yield dividend stocks my portfolio would not be where it’s at right now since I’d miss out on a historical bull run.

As everyone knows, TSLA will soon be added to the S&P.  I’ve been in the market for 6+years now and I still consider relatively new to investing, (though I have managed to make a few mill out of 70kish in the last 1.5yrs from TSLA options.)  What’s happening with TSLA?  Has the S&P inclusion already been ‘front-runned’ by the market?, or is it impossible to ‘front-run’ an inclusion of that size?

What I’m curious about is how the euphoria and emotions of bug investors in general reacted to that inclusion.  I believe the #1 factor in predicting future moves is predicting the emotions of big investors.  So how did big investors react to BRK when BRK was added to the S&P?

TSLA will soon be added, which will require many funds to purchase shares in order to keep their claim that they’re ‘S&P Indexed’.

Hear me out and tell me where I'm wrong. One benefit of an ETN is that the bank doesn't need to own assets. They just promise to redeem the note for an amount determined by the index they create. And my understanding is that an index is just an indicator of value- it  just tracks the value of a defined set of assets without owning or trading anything. As it relates to commodities, this means banks don't need to buy and roll futures contracts. 

If all this is true, why don't banks issue ETNs with indices that track the spot price of commodities (I'm specifically thinking of oil) and reset the price each month based on the front month's futures contract? Why are all the ETNs I've seen tethered to a rolling futures contract that is subject to roll yield? I'm sure there are investors who see this as a feature, but as we saw in March, it's indisputable there are a boatload of retail investors who wish they could invest in the spot price of oil without having to deal with contango. I figure if the ETN structure *could* accomplish this, then someone would have already done it. So why can't it?
