 Should I exercise my 30c 4/16 $gme$? Hey Diamond HANDERS, currently I have 314 shares at $24, and I have 2x contracts for gme expiring 4/16, 1x 30c and 1x 40c.(2 contracts in total). Im wondering, should I exercise both my calls at $7k total ($3k for 30c 4/16, and $4k 40c 4/16) for 200 shares??(I paid $200 each call) Or should I keep my contracts and sell accordingly. I have no buying power btw and if I do exercise I will probably sell around 20 shares gme for 7k to exercise.

I'm a beginner considering investing some money in stocks. The thing is that I move my residence from one country to another every 3-4 years, due to my job. So, let's say I open an account on a broker, deposite some money and start to buy/sell shares for a while. At some point I'll move to another country and I'll keep doing the same, in principle let's say with the same broker.

So, when are taxes paid? Once I transfer the money from the broker to my bank account, so, on my last country? or the operations closed in the first country should be taxed in the first country?

I hope I made the question clear :D I'm afraid of starting "playing around", just with a bit of money and to test this world, and then finding weird surprises if I stick to investing for longer :D

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [RARE] Due Diligence on a Stock Pick That Isn't a Meme Hi Guys,

I've been frustrated to see that stock analyses on non-meme stocks aren't really happening right now so I thought I would talk about one of my favorite stocks at the moment. 

Sun Communities, Inc. ($SUI) - owns and operates 432 manufactured housing and RV communities in 32 states and Ontario.  In November they acquired Safe Harbor Marina (formerly owned by the Koch Brothers) adding  99 marinas across 22 states.

Sun is a REIT collecting rent from over 146,000 mobile home sites each month.  And they collect it all; even during the worst months of the pandemic, Sun was collecting 97% or more of their rental payments. They also increased occupancy during Q32020 bringing them to over 97% occupancy. The Safe Harbor acquisition added the recurring revenue from 40,000 slips as well as the highly profitable dry storage business.

Here are a few other factors that make Sun one of the best REITs out there.

* Annual move-out rates at Sun's parks are less than 1%
* The average stay in a Sun mobile home community is 15 years.
* In terms of providing affordable rental housing, Sun's communities cost 53% less per square foot compared to apartments in similar areas.
* The average cost of a mobile home is about 72% less than the average cost of a single-family home. 
* They're a REIT that owns a lot of acreage (waterfront at that).  As land starts to become more and more valuable, those rents are going to start climbing.

There are way more ways that Sun crushes other REITs [here](https://suncommunities.gcs-web.com/static-files/f6553a93-8b26-436c-89bf-9e165f15f81a) 

SUI announces earnings in a couple of weeks and it is currently trading about $30 below its 52 week high. Last quarter's earnings were about $0.40 higher than Q12020 and that doesn't even count the revenue from Safe Harbors.   The kicker is that Sun's business has only improved since last year.  The stock's price is where it is, in my opinion, due to lack of interest and therefore low volume.  It is currently following all of the other REITs out there that are rightfully not returning to their early 2020 highs due to exposure in offices and retail.

Many people have different reasons for buying into stocks like GameStop, AMC Entertainment, and others. Those reasons include simply making money, or sticking it to Wall Street hedge funds, or even just to have some fun. While they're all reasonable goals, they're all bad ideas, and I'm going to address each one-by-one.

Let's start with the people who'd like to stick it to Wall Street hedge funds, since it requires the most background knowledge.

For those who don't know, a subreddit called 'r/wallstreetbets' recently pushed its readers to buy large amounts of stock in certain companies. Those companies all had one common characteristic: they had been 'shorted' by Wall Street hedge funds. 

'Shorting' is a type of investment that certain accredited firms, like hedge funds, are allowed to engage in. It lets those firms bet on a stock losing value. This is done through a broker, who lends the firm some shares in the shorted company, which the broker has paid for at current value. The firm then sells the broker the shares back once the price has gone down, leading to a profit for the firm and a loss for the broker. Shorts are considered extremely high risk, because the potential losses can be extremely large if the stock were to spike rather than fall.

In comes the 'short squeeze'. When a short squeeze happens, it's usually due to growth in a stock which has been shorted. When a hedge fund sees growth in the stock, they buy shares to compensate for their short. Thus, profits from their owned shares offset losses from their shorted shares. This large purchase of shares by the shorting fund adds to the growth which caused the purchase, and when that happens it's called a 'short squeeze'.

Some of you may already see why currently buying stocks to 'stick it to the hedge funds' is futile. In participating in the squeeze, they've covered their losses. The only way losses would be incurred for hedge funds is if the stock price were to go down and end up between the short price and the price at which they bought the 'hedging' shares. Then, both investments would be incurring a loss. However, it's fairly unlikely these stocks would sit in that range in the long term, given the fact that the underlying businesses are failing.

So for those of you who want to make money, I'm going to offer you a simple statement: buying shares in a business which isn't growing is equivalent to gambling. Buying shares in a business which is actually losing money is gambling but with bad odds. You may be willing to take them, but I promise you can get better odds in other stocks.

Finally, for those who'd like to have fun: just go to the casino. You'll get a free meal, some drinks, and the chance to watch a show, along with similar odds in terms of making a profit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (x-post) (Potentially) sick to my stomach, can someone clear this up for me? So I recently was able to sell some stocks that I held in my Fidelity account (all cash shares) and I've been feeling pretty good. I was checking my account info and I noticed an interesting line:

"Market value of securities" and it is in the negative. Does this go against me? I have no clue what it is or why it is there. My total account value still reflects what I think it should but am I going to wake up tomorrow or Monday with LESS the amount of that market value line? I don't see why, but I am sick to my stomach thinking about it.

\- Both BP and Shell companies invest heavily in clean energy. Clean Energy stocks have high P/S and P/E ratios due to hype. I don't expect anything to change in the hype, but I expect that market slowly starts to value European majors as clean energy. "Beyond Petroleum"

Just to quantify it: NextEra 25B in revenue, 160B valuation. BP 80B valuation, 250B in revenue -> 20x difference!

\- COVID recovery play, lots of investment in infrastructure, bridges and roads. This needs energy. This needs oil -> demand

\- Biden suspends oil and gas leasing -> lower supply

\- There are around 500 oil rigs operational right now. 1 year ago, there were 1000.

\- Massive cut of CAPEX in new production -> lower supply

\- Mega FED printer lowers the value of the dollar, all oil trades in U.S dollar

\- Negative market sentiment -> My best trades were when people were fearful

\- Boomers start to sell oil and get into clean energy. Here again, might by personal bias. Over the past, you could just do the opposite what boomers do, and you'll be fine.

This leads me to think that somewhere between 21 and 22, I expect a massive oil squeeze, with prices \~100 USD/barrel.

**ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER**:

In response to several private messages I've received, I'd like to make it clear that high short interest stocks do not require an explicit short squeeze event to occur in order to create substantial price action. For instance, GME has yet to experience a short squeeze, yet it's experienced incredible price action. This is the result of several other factors.

Throughout this week, I've spent considerable time reviewing several lists of heavily shorted companies. While I can understand why the majority of them have large short interest, I could not understand why Rackspace did, especially considering the current climate. This is a growing and successful cloud technology company, with positive quarterly revenue growth, that is on the verge of profitability. Oppenheimer, the famed investment bank and advisory service, recently initiated coverage on Rackspace, calling for it to outperform, and citing a 40% upside price target. For these reasons, and several more that I will list below, I've opened a long position. By my understanding, this is already a reasonable growth stock, and worth a speculative long position, regardless of the current mania in short selling. However, since industry investors have gone bananas, this stock is susceptible to short squeeze pressure. 

----------

**COMPANY OVERVIEW**:

Rackspace ($RXT) is global multicloud technology company headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, which went public in 2020. It has approximately 7,000 employees and annual revenue over $2 billion. Its quarterly revenue is currently growing at over 13%. Over the last decade, they have made eight major acquisitions, including email hosting providers, virtual servers, and other cloud services. In May of 2020, Rackspace announced the launch of "[strategic initiatives](https://www.rackspace.com/newsroom/rackspace-accelerates-global-expansion-meet-increasing-international-demand-cloud-adoption) to meet the increasing international demand for cloud technology services". On Jan 7th, the global technology research firm ISG released their [2020 ISG Provider Lens AWS Ecosystem Partners Report](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/06/2153923/0/en/Rackspace-Technology-positioned-as-a-Leader-in-three-categories-of-2020-ISG-Provider-Lens-AWS-Ecosystem-Partners-Report-for-Germany.html), in which Rackspace was named a leader in several multicloud technology categories. 

----------

**SHORT INTEREST OVERVIEW**:

Rackspace has a current float of 44.09M shares, with approximately 9.16M shares sold short, and 12 days to cover. The stock opened at $16.28 on November 2nd, and at $19.74 on January 1st. It currently trades at $24.86. Any firm who has been holding shorts over that time frame, or opened positions prior to it, is underwater. Considering the current market climate, and the activity that we've seen in other heavily shorted stocks, I would most firms to reduce their risk, and close their short positions, creating positive price action. 

----------

**A NOTE ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY**

We would all like to know the future, and open positions before the crowd arrives. Now, I understand this is a popular area of interest right now, and the crowd is here. However, of all the high short interest companies I profiled, Rackspace had the lowest IV, at 85.5%. This was a major reason I opened a position. I don't think the opportunity in Rackspace has been recognized by the market yet. Compare their IV with other popular short interest stocks.

* GME: IV 591%
* AMC: IV 493%
* BBBY: IV 210%
* SPCE: IV 183%
* FUBO: IV 205%
* INO: IV 197%

I have some questions -
i) at this price point (300), people can still short it right?  This will go down to two digits after all.
ii) companies like melvin capital can have the arrangement with the short owner. Like melvin sells them 100k share at 300, the short owner sells them back to melvin at 280 ( they dont mind because they made a huge profit, stock price 10 to 280) and melvin does this on repeat. Who is stopping them?
iii) this is about short return deadline. When the deadline crosses I understand you have to pay interest to the short owner. How much is the interest? If the interest is low, melvin capital can wait it out and buy the shares at reduced price when the hype is over. How much is the interest?

Completely clueless on stocks. Tried to buy GME at NYSE open as price was listed at 193$ per share.

Quickly realized that was not the opening price at all and I couldn't buy anything.

Kind of understand now after googling that the opening price is linked to the sell and buy orders in the market at open (+ some after hour trading or something like that).

What I'm wondering however is this scenario:

Say I own 1 share of GME and decide to put in a sell order **before** the market opens at $200 because I'm a retard and saw the value of the stock go down a lot before close the previous day. I have no understanding of how market open price works.

Now, clearly, since the market opens with a much higher price for the share I gather that EVERYONE will literally be screaming to get my one share at my sell order of $200.

Who gets to do the trade? Is there a que system, how does this all work?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone help me understand what this means?

I have never messed with stocks before because I'm scared to death I'll lose all the (very little) money I have. I still feel that way, but knowing there is a person who knows what they're doing buying/selling stocks for me would help me deal with the risk of losing money (I know it's possible).

I was thinking I wanted to start out with $1k, and go from there. But I really don't want to do it myself. I honestly wouldn't mind paying a small fee to someone who would buy/sell for me in my best interests.

From what I understand GME is in a unique position with the Melvin shorts and them being trapped, so it exploded and is immensely volatile.

Aren't the other stocks just in a regular position that only happen to be popular? How can the same explosion be expected of them?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why BDRBF could be ready to explode (DD on Bombardier)  This is going to be a bit long but I don’t think you want your DD’s to be short. TLDR at the bottom.

Just a little background. BDRBF, or Bombardier, is one of 4 major airlines manufacturers in the world. Boeing and Airbus make the big planes, Bombardier and Embraer make the smaller planes (think private planes). Okay so a lot of people have been looking at COVID recovery stokes and as a result hotel stocks like MGM are already trading at 90% of their precovid levels (having recovered from a \~75% fall) and I won’t even get started on things like AMC. Most of the potential COVID recoviery plays are priced as if covid is almost gone, when the reality is things won’t return to ‘normal’ for at least 6 months. But then we have BDRBF, it’s still sitting at less than half of it’s pre covid numbers, and here are 9 reasons it’s massively underpriced and the stock price is likely going to the stratosphere alongside the planes they make.

1. First and probably most important, it’s undervalued compared to its competitors. Boeing and Airbus both have EPS (earnings per share) of -8, and Embraer an EPS of -22. Obviously these numbers aren’t good but what can you expect from a plane manufacturer during a global pandemic/ Meanwhile Bombardier’s EPS is only -1, much cheaper than its competitors. EPS obviously isn’t the perfect number for comparisons with different share prices and different number of shares but the 3 competitors have all had 4 quarters in a row of negative earnings, BDRBF is the only to have one positive earning quarter, and it is the most recent quarter (signaling their return to profitability). And if you look up the earnings misses/beats and earnings/revenue for the 4 companies BDRBF is the strongest. Part of this is because the private jet sector has been less impacted than the public aviation sector as discussed below.
2. BDRBF has around 8-9 billions dollars in debt. Yea i know this is bad, but let me tell you why it’s actually not. The large amount of debt they have compared to their 1.5 bill market cap might seem bad, and it’s a big reason the stock has stayed depressed for years, but after this week their debt will be cut in half as they sell off their train division for \~4.5 billion, cutting their debt in half. On top of this they have $12 billion dollars of back orders. That means with the new capita they have coming in from the sale they can significantly reduce debt and have cash to expand their production capabilities to meet their backorder demand (which they are doing).
3. BDRBF is Canada’s version of too big too fail. Although they are not at risk of bankruptcy, if they ever get in trouble Canada will likely bail them out (as they have done in the past). BDRBF is a very large company in Canada and has international footing.
4. Short volume is at 39%. While this isn’t too important, it’s a possible benefit with all of the short busting that’s been going on, and a potential for an immediate boost as hedge funds have been trimming their shorts across the market.
5. They’ve been cutting their less profitable divisions for years and after the sale of their train division, will be left with their high end jet travel division. These are the $70-100 million dollar private jets that have good margin and are (and have been) less susceptible to market turndowns. For example, covid decreased high end private jet orders only half as much as they decreased plane orders overal. The rich really aren’t affected by this stock as much as normal aviation travel has been.
6. BDRBF has entered into partnerships with companies like MHI which have transferred the risk of maintenance of aircraft to them, while still allowing BDRBF to supply the parts for those repairs. This derisks the company so you won’t have to worry about 1 plane crash tanking the stock like what sometimes happens with airline stocks.
7. Revenue from the business aircraft activities (the division they are focusing on as they’ve sold off their other divisions) actually grew 10% last year.
8. The volume of shares traded is at an all time high. This is something we see a lot with turn around stocks as people flood to but the stock before a sudden and sharp rise in price.
9. After a rush to buy pre owned jets in Q4 of 2020, pre-owned jet inventory has dropped to just 8% this month, the lowest number in more than 2 decades. An unavailability of pre-owned jets does (and has in the past) pushed/forced people to buy new jets, which will lead to more business for BDRBF.

TLDR: Don’t let the low share price or recent struggles fool you, Bombardier is set for an amazing bounce back as they raise billions in capital to increase production capabilities to fulfill their BILLIONS in back orders

GM, Square & Uber rise while the stock market is still focused on the big short squeeze. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market having a bounce back day after the Wednesday sell-off, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/B6BpyXY) gaining 300 points, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/NpK8M1k) rising by almost 1% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QmbLhTF) adding 0.50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n05j6wj) plunged almost 20%, but remains at very high levels above 30… so, really anything can still happen right now with such high volatility in the markets

We saw almost 60% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/mCmXv61) on average volume, with the number of companies above the 50-day moving average remaining pretty much the same as all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/r0jQrf5) finished in the green with Financials, Materials & Industrials leading the way as Large-Cap Value plays [were](https://ibb.co/Zxc7tc4) mostly the flavor of the day, while small-caps lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PQZxbwB) from yesterday, where we can see a big wall of green with a few exception in the big names that reported earnings the night before, with Apple which reported all-time record revenues and crushed estimates, Facebook that also delivered a solid beat and announced future buybacks & Tesla which did miss on earnings but delivered another solid revenue growth for the quarter, losing more than 2.5% for the day, while Microsoft continued to march forward after a spectacular quarter alongside most of the other big companies.

We have seen a big shift in [stock](https://ibb.co/qRxktps) performance after earnings results, with most companies overdelivering in EPS & revenues, but underperforming significantly afterwards, with the avg 1-day performance being almost a negative 2%, as we haven’t seen a negative 1-day performance since the end of the dot com bubble. I think the one big difference now is that most stocks have actually delivered great earnings and are profitable, but they are suffering from big run-ups from pre-earnings trading in a buy the news & sell the event set-up. So, I believe now is not the time to chase earnings reports, stay invested for the long-term and you will benefit from great companies.

In terms of economic data, we saw the 4th quarter [GDP](https://ibb.co/86mVKsN) coming in at a 4% annualized growth, slightly lower than the 4.1% expected, as the economic recovery is still ongoing, but the rate of growth has significantly slowed down from the 33.40% we saw in the 3rd quarter.

We also saw jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/4Z8VBVj) yesterday coming in a little better than expected, dropping to 847K as the continuing jobless claims also dropped to 4.77M while the Kansas [FED](https://ibb.co/sQwLJNV) and the [retail](https://ibb.co/6JDDPw8) inventories came in better than the previous month.

On the other hand, we saw the new home [sales](https://ibb.co/0nMhSSz) rising by only 1.6%, less than expected but are still up over 15% year/year, while [wholesale](https://ibb.co/2kYz2WH) oinventories rose less than expected and the December leading [indicators](https://ibb.co/B2YRRZS) came in-line with the expectations.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Square](https://ibb.co/BtrN0QH) jumping more than 8% as Retail Investors turned to their Cash app to trade stocks that have been blocked by numerous trading platforms. I think Square has become a very good play on both the digital currencies & stock trading, though they still have a lot of work to do to grow into their valuation.

We also saw [UBER](https://ibb.co/vPHDw3p) jumping more than 7% after Morgan Stanley pitched the company based on better-than-expected EBITDA for 2021, future disclosures on Uber Eats and the company being a very good re-opening play as their customers seem to have a healthy balance sheet that will allow them to spend a lot of money once the world re-opens. I also like & own Uber as a good re-opening play, while Uber Eats also makes them a good stay-at-home stock, so a win-win.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://ibb.co/CMqQF70) announced they are planning to be carbon neutral by 2040 as they are planning to go all-electric by 2035 while planning to use 100% renewable energy to power their facilities by 2030 in the US. GM seems to be a very good play on the EV market, not only Tesla & NIO, as they are also planning to bring to the market their Ultium platform by 2025, and I believe with their Cruise venture, [GM](https://ibb.co/k3TpZ56) has a lot of room to run up in the next years.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US Futures are pointing to a red open with the Nasdaq futures down more than 1.6% and are set for the worst performance since late [October](https://ibb.co/L8hQHH0) as we [await](https://ibb.co/rMmF3RL) to get the Consumer Sentiment Index, a couple of other economic numbers & some FED speakers later in the day while the world is still on pause watching the short squeezed stocks developments with some of the trading [platforms](https://ibb.co/BT7V52k) planning to resume buying capacity on the stocks that have been the headlines of the year until now. One simple advice I’d give everyone, watch out and don’t be the last bag holder remaining, do take some profits by at least taking your cost basis out, because no one really knows when this will end or if and big players like the SEC will come down with restrictions or who knows what other measures.

Have a great day and see you next time❗**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on $VRM ? As most of you know, Vroom is a used-car online platform looking to disrupt the huge used car market with an e-commerce approach. Check out their super bowl ads.

**Context**: $VRM started trading with a banger IPO in June, doubling at opening from the original $22 and reaching an all time high of $76 a share September 1st. The last two earning calls have been brutal for the company as they made the mistake of lowering their inventory (to lower risk) letting them miss out on the huge used car market rebound (which $CVNA profited off of, as their share price is up 150% since the $VRM IPO). They are now trading at around $36 and have lost all their momentum, although they might be rebounding. It is currently valued at $4.6B, and undervalued vs. the rest of the industry when accounting for its higher expected growth. It is currently unprofitable and I don't think the market expects them to become so in the near term.

My investment thesis is that the firm has learned from its mistakes, and will hugely benefit from the following upcoming **catalysts**:

1. Boom in used car sales and prices as auto manufacturers need to deal with chip shortages. There is room for multiple players in the massive $800B+ used car market.
2. Boom in car sale e-commerce which currently has a penetration of only 1% in the US. E-commerce revenue up 25% YoY even with the inventory mess-up.
3. Shifting sentiment and regained momentum (projected revenue CAGR of 40+% through 2023) as the market realizes this.
4. IPO insider lockup expiration period was on December 7th so selling pressure is reducing.

> The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.

> # 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants

> J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses.

> U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket.

> # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading

> Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively.

> # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure

> Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, January 29th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Safety from possible Economic Crash? Hey All,

There's a few post floating around on how the clearing houses are not able to support the trading of the shorted stocks do to obvious reasons. Do you all think this signals to close out positions in our retirement accounts in SPY and other broad market ETFs and move to bonds until this all blows over?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can't "the rich" just buy GME or AMC? For disclaimer, I at the moment have no tangible ownership of any stocks and am just holding fake AMC stocks

I was wanting to ask, can't the rich simply stop shorting GME and invest in it? I understand Melvin capital lost billions but it's not like they are suddenly the only rich dude on Wall Street. Everyone is saying they are holding their GME to "stick it" to the hedge funds but now that Melvin capital is in extreme losses, can't wall street just invest in GME or AMC and get rich alongside Redditors?

Am I missing something in the mix?

Edit: just to expand and clarify, I'm not saying GME and AMC are suddenly guaranteed cash printers, I'm trying to understand how in wsb they are saying wall street is paying up for 2008 and AOC and others jumping in against the wall street "elites" when these wall street elites can just find a way to buy in and short on their way out and get money nonetheless.

While working on my university/college stuff and watching stock "porn" I came along some esports stocks. I can't really say a name here because pennystocks are not allowed what is totally fine for me. I'm just wondering if it's a good investment to go for especially with covid, people staying way more time at home, vr and AR increasing technology aspects etc etc. I was from the start of the hype back in the days there watching LOL streams for world. And with people getting more and more on board it could be a good investment. The stock I prefer especially has David Beckham as a marketing face while himself got some shares too for the long run. And now they said they got some solid sponsors for the upcoming year. What's your thinking?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Want to Change to ETrade - A Few Questions After everything that has gone down in the last 2 days, I feel it is time to move to a new broker. Without stating what app I was using as a beginner (hint hint), it was a great experience up until this point but I don't like things I've been seeing lately with GME and AMC. Doesn't smell right. A couple of my friends have moved to ETrade and I was just wondering what people's experience has been with them. Good? Bad? Awful? Also, is there a fee for transferring my account over to them?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinion: there is a good chance the GME stock will crash on Monday. Here’s why. Many analysts have said that most short sellers have already cut their losses and are out of the GME stock. At the very least the shady stuff which happened yesterday and lowered the price and halted buying on many platforms was the perfect opportunity for the remaining short sellers to close and cut their losses.

Unless you pay the premium fees for daily short volume data, and thus you have the exact picture of what’s going on, it would very unwise to buy GME stock in my opinion.

This is the publicly available info for the number of shorted shares https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/ but that data, which states the current short volume to be 61.7million is as of the 15th of January 2021. There is a good chance many, if not most short sellers have already closed. So at very least wait until the 1st of February when this info updates to have a TRUE picture of the situation at hand. There is a good chance that we could see a drastic reduction in the current short volume... which means that everyone will realise the ‘short squeeze’ has already happened and that we are in a bubble (which is quite possible because of the sheer amount of traded GME stock volume in the last few days)... and then there is only one way the GME stock goes and that is DOWN, very quickly.

I have no skin in the game here, but if you think my analysis is wrong, please let me know why._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In Defense of Stopping GME Buys Every gain is one persons loss. Investors pick the investments, brokers help facilitate trading, but don’t pick your investments. 

What if through no fault of the brokerage house, their cohort of investors collectively make a large bet that goes wrong? What if a lot of their account short GME? To reiterate, something the brokers have no control over. What if then the stock surges causing some of the investors to literally go bankrupt because the amount to buy back the stock exceeds the value of their account? Who is then on the hook? You guessed it, your broker. 

If the broker is at risk then they are risking the financial system overall for bets they don’t control. You can bet that they aren’t going to finance their investors bankruptcies for long. So they are forced to stop or limit trading in a security that they have risk or exposure to for the good of the collective system. 

Yes it hurts investors investors that just saw a 70x increase. Of course the longs want it to go up 100x or 1000x. Who wouldn’t? 

But at the end of the day if that causes insolvency for some of these brokers I can assure you the shorts will win.

Happy investing!

Novax reporter 90% effective against covid. This is just a side show that will blow over by next month not to mention all the short gains and new investors will drive these stocks up in the near term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The opportunity for a massive silver rally, one of the most shorted investment assets on the planet Recently I had uploaded a post regarding the investment opportunity for silver, where I go into the base investment case for this precious/industrial hybrid metal. It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvs2ow/silver_way_more_than_just_a_precious_metal_and_an/)

In short, there is a massive and growing amount of demand for silver. This is partly due to the fears of inflation and devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies around the world, but mostly (60% of it to be exact) comes from industrial usage. People mention, and rightly so, the growing emphasis on solar, electrical vehicles and the computerization of nearly everything. What do all these things have in common? They need silver and substantially more of it the more demand for these products grows.

With demand growing and no way to easily scale up supply (see previous post on why), we are looking at quite and attractive industrial supply/demand story backed up by the fact that it is a precious metal and often moves in tandem with gold.

Now, onto the title, the short interest. We have seen an incredible amount of media attention for what happened to GS and the hedge funds that tried to short the stock, but a somewhat similar case can be made for the silver sector. [This article puts it best.](https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand)

"The 8 big shorts have been “lucky” so far, that their predicament isn’t widely recognized. I’m sure that a small number of sophisticated investors are aware of the plight of the 8 big shorts. But the simple truth is that there has been no mention of the concentrated short position in COMEX gold and silver futures by any mainstream media source. Even on the Internet, the concentrated short position is hardly mentioned. There seems to be a growing groundswell of opinion that silver is the cheapest asset around (it is) and I’m even starting to hear some ask why silver is so cheap to begin with? Let me make it easy for you – the only reason silver is so cheap is because of the concentrated short position of the 4 biggest traders, who hold more than 312 million ounces short, as of the latest COT report. When combined with the next 4 largest traders, the concentrated short position grows to nearly 404 million ounces. The connection couldn’t be more direct. Silver is the cheapest because its short position is the largest."

In the debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this has always been biased statements by the bullion dealers. SLV is ran by BlackRock, who have many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk?

Some years ago (in the darkest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Buttler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding os one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Buttler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till "simbolic" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessed silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds Oz Moz over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise.

SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the one with the biggest and arguably most corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will not be threated and because of that will do nothing, as they only stand to benefit from it.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

- Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)

- Much more liquid

- And of course, it has options!!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I’ve already bought a few shares in UMC but im not sure if that was a good buy for the long term. Also I bought into the BB hype from wsb and bought a few - wondering if that was a mistake. Also have been contemplating buying TSM and AAPL shares. Anyways, I’d love any and all advice and recommendations._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which stock of Rolls Royce to buy RYCEY/RRU1 or RR? I see multiple ticker symbols for Rolls Royce Holding.

1. RYCEY (ADR)
2. RRU1(I think RYCEY listed in Frankfurt, because the price graph looks the same)
3. RR listed in LSE

As a European investor, I have the option to buy both RRU1 & RR.

But I am confused because the graph looks very different in the recent 6 months.

* RYCEY/RRU1 is almost at the 52 week low while RR is much higher than RRU1.
* RYCEY/RRU1 seems to have had a sudden crash on 1st December but it's not the case with RR.
* RYCEY/RRU1 seems to have higher headroom growth during the recovery, which makes it look more attractive.

Questions

1. Which class of shares does RYCEY & RR belong to? Both are not ordinary?
2. Based on research looks like some dividend was issued for RYCEY/RRU1 holders hence the crash on 1st Dec 2020. But why didn't RR in LSE crash? How can RR not receive that dividend?
3. Which one should a normal retail investor who doesn't care about voting rights buy? Is there an additional risk in buying RYCEY/RRU1? 
4. RYCEY seems to have a much higher multiple of return (based on price graph) post-pandemic recovery, why would an individual investor buy RR. Or is it case that return will be the same irrespective of which one out of RYCEY and RR is bought?
4. What are the chances of rolls Royce going bankrupt and wiping current stockholders?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about options vs shorting of GME Disclaimer: I am a student in 300k of debt with no money to invest. I am just curious because I would like to be informed and someday invest once I have a job.

According to [this page] (https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options), calls expiring today 1/29/2 for GME with a strike price in the low 20s to single digits are going for 180-200 dollars and rapidly increasing. Do they still have intrinsic value? I'm thinking yes because if we use a strike price of 3, then 193-3 = 190, X 100 for 19,000, - 200 for the call option for a total value of 18,800. Who would offer to write such calls in which they give someone the right to buy a stock from them at 3 dollars when the current price might be 10-20 dollars (I'm assuming that was the price back when these calls were written)?

In addition, puts with strike prices of 180 dollars and above appear to be going for around 30-40 dollars and rising. I am under the impression that when you buy a call or a put, your risk is limited to the premium. Would it be correct to say that options traders are anticipating a price decrease on today, and that their risk if they are wrong is only the premiums paid for the options?

I ask because I am curious about whether or not hedge funds that had a bearish view on this stock are able to weasel themselves out of a short squeeze if they had bought options rather than actually shorting the stock, or by buying a lot of call options that let them buy stocks at lower prices. I am also curious if continued buying and holding of GME stock by retail investors can continue to maintain a higher than normal price for this stock, and if they can still hurt hedge funds that hedge with options. I ask this because I guess my real question is whether millions of retail investors can choose to throw away 10-20 dollars in fractional shares to irrationally drive price up, never intending to recover that money, with the hopes of causing a hedge fund to go under.

P.S. I noticed that the reports for short interest are only every 15 days; is there a way to find out by the hour or day short interest information?

I posted this in wallstreetbets but it was removed by the moderator team. I tried contacting the moderator team, but then it said the user doesn't exist.

So posting it here, cause it's a question to which I'd like to know the answer to. It's fascinating learning about this stuff!

If a shorter is lent 1000 stocks,  which they sell immediately for $10 each, and let’s say the stock goes up to $20, now, is the shorter required to buy back a 1000 $20 stocks to give back to the  lender?

Or can the shorter just give the lender the cash worth of the stock at a cutoff time they both agree on without having the shorter purchase the stock?

If paying the lender back in cash is an option, it thereby avoids bumping the stock further up by the act of closing out short positions, while also accomplishing the goal of paying back the  lender. Or do rules require the short to be returned in stock form, no ifs or buts about it?

I'm here thinking, if the shorter is allowed to return to the lender an agreed upon cash value (and not a stock explicitly), I imagine the lender would prefer the cash option, especially if the lender knows people’re are waiting to sell off  in the squeeze._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Getting into stocks - Confused by differentiating bid/asks between apps Thinkorswim vs TD ameritrade

Like I am not sure exactly when those contracts need to be fulfilled tomorrow?

Now second question is gamma squeeze, people are saying It will be a gamma squeeze because of those contracts needing to be fulfilled forcing the shorters to buy, but this is only a gamma squeeze because apparently their is 5 days to cover or is it 1.5 days to cover now?

Lets say its 1.5 days to cover, during those 1.5 days, that's the real squeeze that's gona happen?

So let's assume its 1.5 days to cover, that means next Monday and maybe Tuesday we expect full squeeze and tmw is only a gamma squeeze because again they need 1.5 days to cover?

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

In need of someone to link me to the actual DD since I only just started to learn how all this works. But as I understand it....

Short interest data that was released Wednesday showed 61.8M short interest with 122.97% of float, and 2.1 days to cover. (FYI I believe this data is only released every couple weeks, so stop believing that people have up to date SI/%, we can only speculate)

The DTC was so low because the volume was so high (93M) that day right? With a (56M) vol does DTC just scale linearly into 3.5 days? Meaning, in one day, they’d only be able to cover 17.7M, or 30%? So worst case, short interest is at worst 90%+ still?

Real newbie, thanks for advice_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why isn't your broker letting you buy? It's probably not a conspiracy Hi guys. I am seeing a lot of information flying around accusing brokerages of blocking retail traders from buying with the express intent of screwing retail investors. Here's another, more rational take, coming from an associate of mine who works on Wall Street:

* In the US, there is one central securities depository called the Depository Trust Company (DTC).
* When you buy a stock on your broker, they take the order to DTC. DTC fills the order by finding a seller. The same thing happens when a hedge fund wants to buy securities, or a bank.
* However, there is risk associated with matching a buyer to a seller. To mitigate this risk, there is something called the "settlement cycle"
* The settlement cycle is a 2-day holding period where the buyer (in this case, your broker) puts down a clearing fund deposit to collateralize the transaction. After the two days, they get the deposit back.

So what's happening here?

The clearing fund deposit that buyers have to submit is adjusted based on market volatility. Because of the volatility surrounding $GME, $AMC, and these other stocks, the clearinghouses/DTC are requiring firms to front excessively high collateral in order to buy shares of these companies.

Many of these brokers simply just may not have the cash on hand to front the collateral to fulfill the massive influx of buy orders incoming for these stocks. So they suspended accepting buy orders for the stocks. They kept the option of selling open, because they have a fiduciary duty towards their customers. Their actions are a byproduct of not having enough money to fulfill the orders.

Why can hedge funds and big banks buy then? Because they have plenty of cash lying around! And if they don't, they can borrow it from each other. Because of this, they don't have to worry about being locked out of the markets due to volatility.

In summary: please don't jump to conclusions and assume bad faith before it is proven. There are lots of people here and on /r/wallstreetbets who have been "investors" for less than 2 weeks and don't understand how everything works. Let's keep a cool head and not make accusations which we can't prove. That goes for everyone, including those in the media. Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is AMD Down?

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/apt](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/apt)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ELI5: GameStop retail investor buy restriction [Educational] I wanted to create a post to document the market events/forces surrounding GME and why the buy restriction imposed by American Retail Brokers is disgusting market manipulation, not just affecting investors on their platforms but world wide. This is for educational purposes, so that we can have something to point to when explaining to others what transpired. Please add relevant information and post links to news articles as sources if you'd like to contribute.

GameStop is well known video game retailer that was suffering losses over the past several years, reducing its stock price as it was considered to have a failed business model. Several hedge funds want to profit on the company’s failure started shorting the stock.

Short Selling ELI5: You think to yourself hey this stock is overvalued, so you borrow it from someone who owns it and sell it getting money today in the hope of buying it back at a later date at a cheaper price pocketing the difference (minus borrowing fees). Hedge funds are greedy, they will hold out until it goes to zero because why leave money on table.

GME stock was heavily shorted, over 100% of the shares available. This means that the shares that were shorted, were shorted again. Everything is finite in this world, and hedge funds thought they had a sure thing that GameStop could not recover. The stock price stayed low and flat for a long time, but some investors saw value in the company, notably Ryan Cohen who started accumulating shares to develop a minority stake in the company. This also happened at the same time that GameStop signed a deal with Microsoft which included a cut of digital sales. When the media/analysts report that the price rise has nothing to do with fundamentals they are half right. First the media is looking at what the company is today not what it can be tomorrow. Secondly, they are ignoring other market forces that can drive stock prices.

Cohen and MSFT are not enough to drive the price up in the short term, what is driving the price up was an amplifying feedback loop of an over shorted stock and retail investors learning a new trick. The year 2020 saw many things, including a rise in option trading among retail investors.

Options ELI5: A Call option specifically is a contract that gives you the option to buy shares at a predetermined price (strike) at a future date (expiry). Options are not a new thing, been around for decades along with futures (do a quick read how many big investors hit home runs on futures back in the day). They serve a legit purpose in portfolio planning and risk management, but also have a way to supercharge returns because the initial investment can be small relative to large payoffs if the stock rises. However, options are risky as they will expire worthless if the stock is below the strike at expiry. Each option contract is for 100 shares. For example, if a stock is trading at $5 dollars, and you buy a call option with $10 strike prices which was trading at $0.50. Your investment will be $0.5 \* 100 \* 1 option = $50. Now if the stock goes up because of some market forces to $12, you basically made ($12-$10) \* 100 = $200 - $50 for the initial investment = $150 profit. There are some time value effects but not important for the ELI5.

Why do the options matter, and how does this create a feedback loop? The best way to protect yourself as the person who sold the option is to buy the stock. So, let's game play this out a bit, you don't think the stock is going to up so you sell an uncovered call (you don't already own the stock) laughing to yourself that the option is going to expire worthless and you just pocketed the premiums. However, the small up ticks from retail investors buying up stocks makes other retail investors think "Hey theses options are cheap, and I think the stock is going to go up" so they buy up options. Now enough of these "worthless" options are out in the market that just the sheer volume requires some stock purchases to hedge the risk. Which causes and uptick in the stock price. Which then drives up the hedging requirements. Rinse. Repeat. This is what was labelled on WSB as a Gamma Squeeze, as the stock price rose, more options became valuable, which increased stock buying, which increased the price making more options valuable. Limited Supply for increasing Demand.

The Gamma Squeeze was one market force that drove up the price, the other is the the hedge funds that shorted the stock. As the price goes up, they are losing money, remember they were hoping to buy the stock back at a lower price, but now it is higher. As the loses start to increase, they will be hit with a margin call, basically saying "you are in the red a bit too much ante up". Working through a simple example, you short $1m of stock. Now the value of the stock has gone up to $2m, so the people who you borrowed the stock from are going to say, "how about you put up 50% of that just incase you go bankrupt" (margin call) which now the hedge fund has to find that money by either selling other stocks or borrowing that money. The other option they have is to close out their short position by buying shares in the open market solidifying their losses. This large scale buying will further cause the stock price to rise, increasing the losses for other hedge funds. Limited Supply for increasing Demand.

The price rise was just beautiful efficient supply and demand of a finite commodity in a free market, retail investors were saying no to hedge funds "This company is not going zero, you were wrong, now you have to pay me for your mistake". This created fear of a "short squeeze" that hedge funds would have to franticly buy back shares (from retail investors) at high prices to close of their positions, losing billions in the process. This happened with VW stock in 2008.

Jan 28th 2021 the market wasn't free. By brokers restricting the buying ability of retail investors, the market was no longer operating efficiently. Market prices are determined by a bunch of random people saying, "Hey I'm willing to pay X for this because I think it's worth Y", and when two people agree on price X a transaction is made. Another transaction will be made when two people agree on Y. The buying restriction took out the ability for retail investors to have their say what the price should be, having the price now dictated by the funds who were still allowed to trade and had the most to lose. Any investor who had stop loss set would have been doubly screwed. The stop loss would have forced shares to be sold, while not having the ability to buy back as the prices was falling. When investors set stop losses, they expect the market to be operating efficiently, meaning the price reflects the true market sentiment of all participants.

Stop Loss ELI5: When you buy a stock, you can tell your broker that if the prices fall below a certain threshold sell, limiting your losses. Good practice so you do not get wiped out because you are not sitting at a trading desk all day. That is if the market price is efficient.

I do not want to put my tinfoil hat on, but the ones who had the most to gain from the restriction were the hedge funds. This has nothing to do with protecting the average retail investor from market volatility, if anything it did more harm than good. We make our own decision to risk our money.

Wall Street created this beast, trading apps made it easy to trade commission free but with some sketchy filling practices (not always at the best price for the investor). The rise of option trading by retail investors was due to people having more time on their hands due to the pandemic, and to be honest, people who are down and out looking at it as a lottery ticket.

I fear that these events today will dissuade working class from investing, they have been shown that the game is rigged.

Can you buy and sell a stock before the fund transfer into the brokerage account finalizes? Is that legal? (and not talking about on margin)

(like how some brokerage accounts allow you to have instant buying power)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All banks have to do to counter the retail frenzy is suspend the short borrowing rate The incentive for shorts to cover is the high interest rate - as time goes on, they have to pay interest on the shares they borrow. 


If banks perceive the retail hype as a threat to the hedge funds they back, it would be within their interest to protect said funds. The big threat to funds is obviously having to cover their short positions and cause the GME price to spike - so by removing the interest rate hedge funds are under no pressure to cover. No time pressure means they can cover as retail loses interest, whether it's in one week or one year. They might have lost billions on paper, but all they need to do is lie low and there will be little to worry about.


It was reported many hedge funds actually increased their short position, which makes sense and means they could actually end up on top after all of this ends. Retail interest is going to wane and having no incentive to cover means these hedge funds can just ride it out.

Has anyone done this? Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Getting Started Questions Hey all. I'm thinking of opening a TD Ameritrade account to do some stock purchases. My current stock experience is through Computershare for a ESPP account I have through work.


I'm not looking to get rich, just try my hand at making a little scratch. Initial investment is looking like $500 that I'd probably put into a stock valued less than $20/share. This is money I can afford to lose.


What should I expect? Using TD are there charges when buying (I know from my ESPP that there are fees when selling). Is playing with $500 even worth it when considering fees?

Tips? Suggestions?

Edit: words don't mean what I think they do_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the source data of short interest percentages? Question regarding short interest. I am interested in the actual source for short interest. On reddit, people seem to be giving updated numbers each day but how do we know it's correct? 

FINRA (https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) says reporting short interest by firms only occurs every two weeks with the report release delayed by another week. The latest info we have is from 1/15. So how are people reporting updated numbers? Is it just a calculation or guess? The meme stocks are bolstered by this massive short interest but are they working off old information?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do hedge funds really make 30-40% profit per year? https://hedgefollow.com/top-hedge-funds.php
I know nothing about stocks so please excuse me if I'm wrong but I'm looking at these top hedge funds who are making 30-40% per year, 300% in 3 year, unbelievable numbers compared to the average 7% stock return.
So if you give them 1 million a year later you have 1,4million, that's it?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pattern Day Trading I am newer to trading on the stock market and know that you are unable to be a day trader unless you have a minimum of $25,000 in the market. What will mark you as a day trader though? 

I’ve heard/read that buying/selling the same stock in the same day will count towards day trading, but I’ve also heard/read that making 4 or more trades per week will count towards day trading. Could someone please help clarify this for me?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a difference in buying ETFs like VOO or SPY on different platforms, specifically WeBull vs. native platform? I keep hearing the same information about buying index funds/ETFs but I've never actually jumped on it since I don't really know if there's a best way to purchase one... I know it might sound silly if you already know how it works but from what I know even minor differences in stuff like management fees can make a massive difference over time. Are there any differences to buying VOO on Vanguard vs. just buying it on WeBull? Most articles I read say that outside of Vanguard, you have to pay a buy fee, but WeBull waives all of those, and Vanguard has a $20 yearly fee. If there's no differences, might as well just buy on WeBull and save $20/year.  

I hope you can tell how lost I am. Probably any information helps. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Think or Swim - Options Trading I currently have an account with The Sheriff of Nottingham and an account with TD Ameritrade.   I want to transfer the remainder of my Nottingham account to TD Ameritrade.... Nottingham has been having issues on and off and today was the last straw.

I started playing around with Think or Swim and I must say -- it's not bad... it's not bad at all.  However, the one thing I can not figure out how to do efficiently on ToS is Option Trading.  


In Nottingham I just click on the date I want to go to and I get a nice quick list of options, strike price, break even, and change and price.  


In ToS I have to click a drop down, find the date, ponder the option, go to an Analyze tab and then do some moving around with my mouse to kind of figure out what the break even price will be.      


Is there an easier way to do this?  Someone mentioned something about ThinkScript might be able to do this?  Basically, I feel like this shouldn't be this hard -- simple list... Strike Price, Break Even, Price, and Day Change Amount._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why does no one use or not talk about Merrill Edge? r/MerrillEdge is empty, I just figured I'd use them to manage my IRA and CMA as my checking account was/is at BOA. Is it the interface? I found it hard to track the live price by spamming the refresh on that half-page ticker info. Thanks all_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on Wells Fargo (WFC) in the current market Wells Fargo is being traded right now and am wondering what you guys think considering all the new circumstances. Yes, I know, you hate WF, fake accounts fiasco, thing is I get a hunch that is has potential to go way up from here. I just don't know how fast, or if it'll beat the S&P 500. In 2020 most big stocks grew significantly but this stock has been lagging hard.  

Also not sure about anything regarding market crash speculation in relation to a buy-now and hold position on this stock..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
