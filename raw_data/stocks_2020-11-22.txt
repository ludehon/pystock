Edit: Already into: TDOC , PLTR , FSLY_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ calculation of Enterprise Value (EV) Enterprise Value (EV) is calculated as follows : EV = MC + Total Debt - Cash

>What Does Enterprise Value Tell You?

>Enterprise value (EV) could be thought of like the theoretical [takeover price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeoverbid.asp) if a company were to be bought.

(source Investopedia)

Why would you add the total debt and subtract cash and not the other way round.

Because if you were to buy the company would debt lower the real value and cash add to the value?

Because you have to pay debt so you lose money and have cash to pay off your debt?

so I would think it would have to be like this EV = MC - Total Debt + Cash

I would really much appreciate it if someone could explain this to me

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment help I just started looking into investing before the election and made a small profit and quickly realized I'm way over my head. 

I have \~60k in savings. 40K of which will be required for a house downpayment in April. I'm currently invested in DKNG, PLUG, SE, ENPH, and FSR with a total of \~6k invested. Through work, I have a 401k (Thrift Savings Plan) and a separate retirement plan from a previous job.

I'm curious how I can best manage my portfolio before I put that 40k down into a house. As of now, I plan on just leaving the required downpayment in savings and investing some of that extra cash. Is this wise? Would it be better to invest heavier but in something low-yield and relatively safe? I feel like a four-month investment plan is not nearly enough time to have decent returns but stay safe, no?

More words so post doesn't get pulled again. More words, more words._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Better ways to buy hot stocks in an overvalued market? I think most can agree that the best performing stocks YTD are also some of the most overvalued in history.  Given that the market has gone up in almost a straight line since 2009, and tech/cloud/EVs have gone up even faster since March, valuations on these industries are very stretched and the bears are starting to get louder and more insistent that a true 50%+ crash is coming.  

I think we can also agree that, even if we are in a massive bubble, a bubble can grow beyond anyone's expectations, especially with zero rates.  So even if the bears are eventually right, trying to short stocks can ruin you before you're eventually proved right.

So what's an investor to do if you want to make money, if you recognize that high growth stocks are overvalued and value stocks are unlikely to provide much return?

IMO, making predictions about the short term future of stocks is a fool's errand.  Instead of making predictions, it's better to be a bull with a plan so you don't react emotionally when things go south.  With that in mind, here are some strategies I've been thinking are appropriate for this type of market:

1)  **Simply B&H** - if it's a quality stock with great management, and a long runway for growth - just B&H and ride out the volatility.  Works for longer time periods, but you really need a 10+ year time period.

2)  **Buy with insurance** - buy the stock, but reserve 1-2% of capital for insurance, either in the form of buying puts, or selling calls or both.  Even if the puts create a 1-2% pa drag on your returns by expiring worthless most of the time, a high growth stock has the potential to return far more than that.  And if the market does crash, the options will pay off asymmetrically.  Alternatively, you could buy VIX ETPs which also have a decaying baseline.  

3) **Buy with insurance and trend following overlay** - academic studies have shown that momentum exists in multiple asset classes using lookback periods of 3-12 months which means that the best (worst) performing stocks continue to outperform (underperform) for some time going forward, usually 1-6 months.  Applying 3, 6, and 12 month momentum can help to get you out of stocks and into safety (cash or bonds) when the trend is negative, and back in when the trend is positive.  Note that this method doesn't get you out exactly at the top and back in exactly at the bottom.  Trend following always has a lag and will not help you much in sharp drops and reversals like we had in Feb-Mar this year.  But it will greatly reduce the drawdown in a grinding crash/revaluation like what we experienced in 2000 and 2008.  Also, using shorter lookbacks can help you respond faster, but may also generate more trading costs and taxes.  12 month momentum or a 10 month/200 day moving average are generally considered the best balance, with lots of out of sample confirmation.

Hey everyone and Welcome, my name is Cristian and today I will share with you 10 of the best tips that can start making you money right now

1. Start saving money and INVEST IT

The most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don’t spend it on useless things that don’t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people’s mistakes

2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES

You think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren’t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not… Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don’t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don’t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don’t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon.

3. The number 3 tip is Don’t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don’t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you’ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)

Moving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS

Here you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn’t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)

Don’t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF’s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they’re value.

Number 6. Don’t try and reinvent the wheel, it’s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn’t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don’t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers

Let’s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don’t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let’s face is… THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don’t lose that much money if you buy curs that don’t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn’t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they’re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets… This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.

[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) /

Number 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT

So, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys… that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn’t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)

Number 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven’t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn’t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don’t enjoy or don’t have the potential to add big to your net worth

And finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.

You should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don’t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don’t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)

Hey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you

As soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don’t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don’t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.

Exro Coil Driver Ready for Electric Cars with Engineering Validation  


Engineering validation of the 100 Volt Coil Driver marks key milestone toward delivering electric car products with improved performance  
Testing confirms operation of series to parallel algorithms driving dynamic switching under load  
Delivering prototype to Potencia to demonstrate maximum performance in operating application  
Calgary, Alberta (November 20, 2020) – Exro Technologies Inc. (TSXV: EXRO) (the “Company” or “Exro”), a leading clean technology company which has developed a new class of power electronics for electric motors and powertrains, is pleased to announce that it has completed the engineering validation on the 100 Volt Coil Driver for electric cars.  


Validation of the 100V Coil Driver engineering technology is a key milestone for Exro to delivering commercial products in the rapidly growing electric car markets. The 100V Coil Driver will deliver next generation performance in power and efficiency to mobility applications with electric powertrains.  


Testing has proven that the series to parallel algorithms driving the dynamic switching under load is operating as expected. Exro is on schedule to deliver a prototype to Potencia Industrial, S.A. DE C.V. (“Potencia”) and maximize performance in operating applications. Potencia is one of Mexico’s largest motor manufacturers with over fifty years of experience specializing in custom applications like the new Pronto Power electric powertrain. With over one million miles traveled, the Pronto Power is leading the transition of electric fleet vehicles in Latin America.  


“I am extremely pleased with the speed-torque results from our bench tests”, said Eric Hustedt, Chief Engineer of Exro. “I have no concerns over the operations of the drive moving forward. The hardware is more than able to support the dynamic switching under loads, and demonstration of these algorithms in the drive is a major breakthrough.”  


“We are excited about moving forward in delivering our technology into operating applications”, commented Sue Ozdemir, Chief Executive Officer of Exro. “This validation represents all the hard work our engineering team has put in to take our patented technology from simulations to dyno bay testing, taking us another step closer to positioning ourselves as technology leaders in the transition to electric vehicles.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So cyberpunk 2077 is coming...

Currently, we're aiming at an account that I am the owner of, and he is labeled as the account operator, however; he created this account so I feel like he has more control (TDAmeritrade) than just operations. 

Im doing my research, but its an area I'm newer in so cause for pause.

Have a day bulls. 🍻

“The FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.

The FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.

This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

The FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease
The treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.

Regeneron's REGEN-COV2 'antibody cocktail' - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus' spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells.

Regeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.

WHAT IS REGENERON'S ANTIBODY COCKTAIL?

Regeneron's drug 'cocktail,' REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company from mice and another isolated from a recovered COVID-19 patient, each of which may help to neutralize coronavirus. 

The firm's latest data from the ongoing trials, show the drug drove down the viral loads of patients who were not hospitalized and cut their recovery times by nearly half. 

But it's very much an experimental treatment, and the data announced earlier this week are the first published from the trial. 

Two patients treated with the antibody cocktail had 'adverse events' - undesirable side effects. One of those was a 'serious' adverse event, but Regeneron did not reveal details of what happened to the patient, who received a low dose of the drug. 

REGN-COV2 is comprised of a duo of therapeutics in a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies (hence REGN-COV2's distinction as a 'polyclonal antibody'), which are clones of antibody that attacks a specific antigen.

The company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.

The FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.

Trump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments, including an antibody therapy from Regeneron.

Monoclonal antibodies treatments are also being developed by Eli Lilly and other companies.

The drugs mimic antibodies that the immune system naturally produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens.

Trump later credited the experimental drug therapy with aiding his recovery.

Trump returned to the White House on Monday October 5 after spending three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Maryland for coronavirus.

The monoclonal antibody cocktail is considered experimental because clinical trials are ongoing and it hasn’t been approved for the market by the FDA.

Trump was able to receive it through the FDA’s 'compassionate use' provision, where unapproved drugs are administered to seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options.

While Regeneron has shared promising results of the treatment, which cut the viral load of COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, there is no evidence the drug cut the risk of death or 'cured' patients.

There also is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect.

Last month, Bill Gates said Trump was wrong to call monoclonal antibodies treatment a 'cure' for COVID-19, but says it’s the most promising therapeutic in research for now.

'The word "cure" is inappropriate because it won't work for everyone. But of all the therapeutics, this is the most promising,' the Microsoft founder said on the October 11 broadcast of NBC’s Meet The Press.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on SNAP?

I have sold a few stocks when I made good % I was happy with and worried about stock valuations going a bit crazy. 

This weekend I have changed my tactic and decided to add stop limits where I am happy to sell at for a couple of stocks. But going to adjust my stop limits if things carry on going up.

I'm  fairly new to stockies, so bare with my possibly stupid question but -  Is a company with more shares outstanding gonna be experiencing lesser  swings than a company with less shares outstanding?

Background  to that question - As I've been comparing 2 companies, respectively  Xpev and NIO to me it was clearly visible that Xpev with 1/2 of Nio's  total shares outstanding experienced larger swings in price. E.G. when  Nio went up 10% Xpev went up 20%, when Nio was down 2% Xpev was down 5%  and so on. \*they are both Chinese EV companies so they pretty much share  the market

I sunk a solid chunk of change into it, remembering how I gained 21% on my last run of good news about the vaccine. That day, she spiked, and I sold for a solid gain. Now, I’m trying to do that again. Pfizer officially filed for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as of Friday. Turn around time could be 2-3 weeks (but the holiday could affect that). Anyways, I’ve got a strong feeling that if they get the authorization, $DAL should hit at least $45+. My current average is $38.18/share, and if more money presents itself this week, I may try to get in more as she continues to decline before the news. If Pfizer loses (which I find unlikely, but it’s possible) she could slip a lot further... but if she wins, I feel like this is gonna shoot to the stars. Am I crazy hopeful?

I am talking about in the post-covid world. Disney seems to have that “invisible moat” because they own the trademarks and licensed of Marvel,StarWars etc yet it still has some drawbacks for growth...these are my questions:

1-Disney invested a lot in Marvel Star Wars etc...but with time, less people will go to cinemas and half of the cinema theaters might even be out of business in like 10 years—people watch stuff on netflix or disneyplus these days rather than paying that direct money disney would receive from ticket prices...how will this affect them?

2- they have all these trademarks but they dont make video games from them(where the real money is...)—they let others do it and get a cut—which might be a good strategy but if the cinema sector crashes then dont they have to move on to gaming to compensate loss profits? Gaming is gonna be bigger than cinema soon anyways

3-I think Marvel had an incredible run the last decade but let s face it, the next generations will find those movies over the top and pretentious,,already people started laughing at them and they are being stigmatized—how long can Marvel keep this popularity if this stigma goes bigger?
