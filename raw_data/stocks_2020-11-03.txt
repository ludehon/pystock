Stock Trades on Margin and Capital Gains hi there,

If I buy $1,000 worth of stock (10 shares at $100 each) on "margin" and lets say that the stock is valued at $1,200 a few days later, and I sell 8 shares at $125 ($1,000), this would close out my margin balance, but I would still have 2 shares of that stock held. 

In this scenario, is there any capital gains since the whole transaction was done on margin and the sale of the 8 shares paid off the margin balance?  

Also, I am assuming that if I sold the 2 shares of stock the following day, then that entire trade would be a short term capital gain, correct? Or would the sale of these 2 stocks have be higher than $100 purchase price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Green energy stock earnings? Thoughts on $RUN and $PLUG upcoming earning call? SEDG just had its earnings and went down by 50$ a share. I’m heavily invested in green energy stocks due to the election, but wondering if I should sell some shares with the upcoming earnings. Im sort of new to investing so I’m wondering if there’s any analysis or any way to predict the earnings?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Draft Kings Stock Price Draft Kings is projecting \~28m in profit in 2023.
