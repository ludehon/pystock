 Vanguard Volatility Calculation Hi all,

Hoping there are a few Vanguard investors who would be able to answer the following question. Vanguard’s Buying Power on a margin account, as far as I can tell, is (~50% of your holdings + cash on hand in your Money Market Fund) multiplied by 2. It stands to reason that if you had no holdings whatsoever and only cash in your MMF, your Buying Power would be double your cash position. If so, is that always the case?

I’m familiar with Robinhood’s volatility feature that limits a full 2x buying power on positions that meet certain conditions, such as small price shares or a small market cap. Does Vanguard apply the same buying power ceiling, such that you need to put up *more* than 50% cash in certain circumstances?

I use Vanguard for my Roth and some buy and hold positions in a margin account, so if Vanguard always allows 2x buying power on all positions (in cases where Robinhood might limit the amount I could invest), I would strongly consider shifting everything over to Vanguard instead of dividing my cash between the two.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is French Dividend Tax also for foreign shares on a French market? France residents pay a dividend tax of 30% when French shares pay dividend. 
Some countries have agreements with the French government for a reduction in these tax tariffs (for non-French people investing in French shares). 

I however don’t know if French tax of 30% is applicable for i.e. English shares on the Paris market for example. 
Those English shares are deposited in France of course, but the domicile of the issuer is a different country.

1: Born in darkness; When I first started off I didn’t really know much. I invested heavily into MSFT and less so into JPM because well, I knew them. Ngl I got pretty good returns. Until bitcoin started to gain in popularity and I made a lot of money with that thankfully. However the more money I had I the more stressed I got, that’s when I learned about diversification and index funds. Which is a segue into...

2: Finds Indexing enlightenment; After I learned about index funds, I invested heavily into them. They seemed so easy and great. 

3: Over-complicates everything; I found these index funds so nifty that I probably had upwards of 20 different index funds at one point, I was after the perfect portfolio of perfectly weighted small cap value, REITs, mid caps, and you name it. It then began to be very difficult to track and rebalance my allocations. This lead to....

4: Embraces simplicity; now I realize I was just shooting myself in the foot having so many indexes and ETFs. I’m slowly working on moving into just 7 funds (VOO, IJH, IJR, VNQ, VXUS, VNQI and AGG). I’m sure one day I’ll narrow it down even more, I’ll probably eliminate IJH and add it to VOO, or I’ll eliminate VNQI and add it to VXUS. 

I’m not gonna lie, it’s been hard simplifying down. It’s stressful selling things I’ve become accustomed to having while also managing tax implications.

Pretty much as the title says. With regular stocks, you can look at P/E ratio, there's plenty of technical charts etc, but a lot of this doesn't exist when a company is about to IPO.

What sort of metrics are best to consider in this case? At the moment, I check the CEO (do they have a history of successful companies), what companies are they currently working in, how "future proof" is their business and model (quite a subjective one), but not many hard metrics.

My question is whats beyond meats moat like? Do they have/need anything beyond their branding? I'm trying to see where they go in 5-10 years past just having okay tasting mushy meat and fast food chain deals. Are they innovating in plant based meat? I assume they have won once their fake meat is 1 to 1 with real meat but is that even a likely goal.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Berkshire is more than Buffett I swear to god if I read another article about Buffett buying Snowflake or another business that he obviously does not understand I am going to blow a gasket. There are at least 4 lieutenants that are buying positions other than Buffett and Charlie.

People writing these articles are either too lazy to do enough research to realize that Warren Buffett is not the only person that allocates capital in Berkshire Hathaway or they are purposefully misinforming the readers of their articles to increase readership. Both of these in my opinion should disqualify them from trying to inform the masses about investing.

The stake they bought in Snowflake was less than $1 billion. In relationship to the amount of cash on hand in berkshire that is the equivalent of the $50 bet you make on the Browns to go to the Super Bowl. It is a small drop in the bucket.

Technology/marketing/sales/etc… is being led by ABBV executives for eventual buyout and integration into their aesthetics business. New CEO is a Winklevoss 2.0 and the other brother is VP of marketing at AbbVie. Executives, management team, and medical advisory team all have strong ties to helping coolsculpting get bought out by Allergan for $2.48 billion.

Ok, it’s time I shared an actually good pic for you nards to make some money. Disclaimer here, there are no options presently available for the stock and you may need to hold for at least a year. So… now that 90% of you degenerates are no longer reading here is the DD.

Soliton is a company that develops, produces, markets, and sells a medical device that uses rapid acoustic pulse technology to provide minimally invasive (and non-invasive) treatment for several aesthetics treatments and enhancements. Pretty much they have invented a device that removes tattoos in 3 visits, reduces the appearance of cellulite, and can remove the appears of scars. Their business model is based on the “razor and blade” strategy where they sell the device then profit from each cartridge used in the treatments.

1. Invented by Christopher Capelli, an MIT engineer and medical doctor, who led the office of technology-based ventures at the university of Texas before leaving to co-found Soliton.

a. Significant because this man’s job was literally to review medical device technology. He must have seen hundreds or thousands of different devices in his time there and has seen which one’s workout and which don’t. Upon coming across this device (which maybe he made, maybe a student made, maybe it was a combination of both) he ups and quits his job because THIS IS IT! The one that will make him a billionaire

2) The Science Advisory Board for Soliton has 9 people who are members of the Zeltiq/Coolsculpting/Abbvie Medical Advisory team. Ironically enough, this device directly compliments the CoolSculpting treatments and the aesthetics portfolio that Abbvie is building out.

a. Significant because CoolSculpting has been growing and become more and more readily available and once Soliton’s RAP devices launches it will be directly integrated into each office.

3) The Winklevoss twins 2.0 are Brent and Brad Hauser. They both attended Standford where they were track stars they eventually made their way into medical device industry. Following a similar path they were both involved at the executive level in Zeltiq (ie. Coolsculpting) before the buyout and then were executives for Allergan (Allergan bought Zeltiq, then allergan was bought by Abbvie) and eventually Abbvie. Although working in different capacities they were closely tied in working on the projects/business.

a. Significant because what has happened is Abbvie seem to already be planting their people at Soliton to guide it in the right direction and ensure its success before they decide to add it to their portfolio. They told Brad, who was on the board of directors for Soliton while working at Abbvie, to take the CEO position so they have more control. Meanwhile ‘ol Brent is still at Abbvie, probably talking over thanksgiving dinner about all the money they will make when the buyout happens in a few years.

4) FDA approval has already been granted for the purpose of removing tattoos. Tattoos can now be removed in 3 visits vs what would normally take 8-10 visits. Soliton has hired our marketing team and distribution partners for their launch in Q2 2021. FDA approval for purposes of cellulite treatment should take place in the next 1-3 months.

a. Significant because they have a real product with real results that adds real value to the market and by this time next year they will be rolling in revenue. FDA approval for the device has already been granted so the approval for cellulite treatment is damn near guaranteed. Then… it is on to the FDA approval for keloid and hypertrophic scar reduction which is supposedly a bigger market than tattoo removal and cellulite reduction combined.

5) Lack of options and small number of shares outstanding has caused institutions to overlook the company for now. This will probably change once volume picks up, revenues start showing next year, and cellulite FDA approval is finalized.

Many of us gripe about someone posting DD *after* the stock had it big climb. I was going to wait to prove right, but I though this would be helpful for everyone to know of this lingering opportunity. I sincerely hope you make money. Once you start connecting the dots, you can see how this company is actually being groomed to be acquired by Abbvie and if they spend the same amount on SOLY as they did for Zeltiq (2.48 billion), you are looking at 13x return from today’s price.

Why wouldn't Abbive just buy them now? Well, it’s a pain the a$$ do buy a company, especially one that hasn’t sold anything yet. I think they want to just leave the heavy lifting and regulatory crap to Soliton but once the FDA approvals go through, sales start happening, and they get concrete proof of the market potential, then they will step in. And with so many board members and executives with ties to Abbvie, who do you think will get the first opportunity?!

Good luck to all

Hey guys, it is my first time posting here and I thought this could be interesting.

As of right now, the stock exchange continues its bullish run, reaching a point where it could definitely be considered overvalued as a whole.

According to Buffet's Indicator, which divides the total market cap by the total GDP, we find ourselves at a point where the stock market appears to be just as overvalued as it was during the 1999-2000 .com bubble.

Certain stocks such as the EV industry related keep growing at an alarming rate, with Tesla reaching a P/E ratio of +1000.

FED interest rates remain at an all time low after this COVID-19 crisis, keeping borrowing attractive, whereas in 1999, they had increased to over 5% before the bubble bursting.

My question here is the following, is this temporary lowering of interest rates hiding the real state of the stock market?

Will this bubble burst once borrowing is made less attractive to people/ institutions?

Is this bubble being held by current low interest rates and increased short term spending?

It is interesting to think about. I for one think once everything returns to "normal" we will see some of these prices fall back.

However, I’m not sure how to go about it, or can even certify if my interpretation of volume and market cap are fully accurate. As an example, if this specific XYZ symbol is trading at $50 with an average volume of 47M and mkt cap of 205M. How much of the underlying would need to be sold for the stock to go down 1%?


Ultimately, I’m curious in understanding how much option trading could be responsible for prices moving up or down. I’ve seen folks on Reddit trade option volumes that literally equate to 1 million shares of the underlying..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you guys use puts to hedge your long positions? My portfolio is all ETFs (VOO, QQQ, and ARKK) and blue chip stocks (AMZN, AAPL, and GOOG). Based on the Shiller P/E ratio and the Buffett indicator the market is overvalued, and I think the inevitable crash will be within the next year, so I bought LEAP puts on the ETFs. I'm pretty new to investing though, so I wanted to see what others think about this strategy. Any feedback is appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Making gold more liquid; overcoming diseconomies of small scale As we all know, gold has had a wild ride this year and 2021 could scale new heights.

It bothers me, though, that although I bought physical gold just before it soared in July 2020, this was compromised by the diseconomy of small scale (I could only afford to buy a very small quantity at the time) and seller's mark-ups (duh!) To break even or to make a minuscule profit would require the gold spot price to be at the sorts of heights we saw in August.

What I am wondering is if there is any mileage in exchanging the physical gold for ETFs or for digital gold (if that's possible) to get better liquidity and exposure to spot price increases._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are indexed funds not performing the same as their index? Hey peeps,

Im interested in purchasing a nasdaq indexed fund offered by CIBC. 

The further far i go back in the fund's history, the more the average underperforms from the nasdaq index. 

For example, in the past year the fund has had an average yearly return of 45%, same as the index. In the past 3 years, the fund's return is 23.9% while the index is 27.6%. Past 5 years, 21% for the fund and 30% for the index and since the inception of the fund (Oct 2002), it's up 14.4% annually while the index is up 40% annually. 

Any ideas?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about hedging my actively managed mid cap and up tech stock portfolio. My entry conditions

Exit conditions
Stock has dropped 40% from recent highs while sp500 is over 10 week sma.
Or
Stock has dropped 10% from recent highs while SP500 is under 10 week sma.

My goal is to explore ways I might reduce my long exposure while not negating my strategies edge.

Thank you in advance for helping an excited learner of the investment world._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Canada NDP Party calls for CPP to Dump Shares of Palantir Howdy yall. Found this article regarding Canada's NDP Party calling out the Canadian Pension Plan for supporting Palantir as the second largest institutional shareholder which you can find below. The party is apparently also pushing for "legislative changes to how the CPPIB looks at investing, calling for the board to further consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors." 

If passed it would prevent organizations like the CPP from holding shares with companies that are considered to have unethical business practices or to have violated human rights. Voting on the bill won't take place until March however just wanted to share on here to see if anyone thinks this might have a negative impact on Palantir. The NDP only have 24 seats within Canada's House of Commons, behind the Liberal, Conservative, and Bloc Quebecois so I don't see them having a lot of sway within Canadian Parliament unless they are able to sway the other parties over to their side. Just wondering how you think this news might affect Palantir's share price as I was thinking of selling tomorrow morning after today's amazing run.

I think we could expect a travel boom just in time for spring break/summer since people are already starting to get vaccinated and after a year stuck at home I feel like the demand for travel will be huge, I was thinking of investing in a cruise line given that their prices are still low and I think they will easily match their Pre covid prices soon.
I'm planning to go long but which cruise line should I pick, Carnival, Royal Caribbean or Norwegian?
My first thought was to go for carnival since they also own hotels and other travelling destinations.
Let me know your thoughts_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Have any SPACs actually redeemed warrants for partial shares? I hold quantumscape warrants. They have a redemption feature that turns them into partial shares if quantumscape decides to exercise this right (cashless). There's speculation that, because they need the cash, they will instead go for the cash option and let warrant holders exercise the warrants normally with a strike of $11.50. I'm wondering if any older SPACs with the option to convert warrants to PARTIAL shares have actually forced warrant holders to take the partial shares. There's a huge amount of money at stake between the two different outcomes for my warrants. Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
