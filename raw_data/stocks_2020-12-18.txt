 PLTR downgraded by Credit Suisse, what do you think? ## Sell Palantir Stock, Credit Suisse Says. The Valuation Isn't Sustainable. -- Barrons.com

1:21 pm ET December 18, 2020 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Eric J. Savitz 

[Palantir Technologies](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=618436812) shares have had a wild ride in the public market. 

The data-analytics software company (ticker: PLTR) direct listed on the New York Stock Exchange in mid-September, opening for trade at $10. The stock drifted at that level at first, only to began levitating in late October, soaring as high as $33.50. 

The stock closed Thursday at $27.23, up 170% from the IPO, giving the stock a valuation of about $50 billion that Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick considers untenable. Friday, he cut his rating on the stock to Underperform from Neutral, while listing his target for the price to $17, from $13. 

"We see valuation disconnected from fundamentals with the stock now trading over 50% above our previous blue sky scenario," he wrote in a research note. "To be clear, we continue to believe Palantir offers a unique data analytics platform, helping organizations solve some of the most complex challenges in the world -- including those related to the fight against Covid-19." 

Still, with the stock trading at 46 times estimated 2021 revenue, the risk is to the downside, he said. And Zelnick sees multiple risks. 

For starters, he noted, Palantir generally signs multimillion-dollar contracts, while businesses are giving more scrutiny to large deals. He pointed to a disappointing recent earnings report from the analytics company Splunk as a case in point. At the same time, Zelnick said, the business is highly concentrated, with 20 customers accounting for about 60% of revenue, making Palantir reliant on "large, lumpy deals." 

Zelnick also reminded investors that 80% of the shares outstanding will be unlocked and free to trade on the third trading day after the company reports its fourth-quarter earnings. "We expect significant supply to come to market," he writes. 

The analyst also has governance and reputation worries about Palantir. 

"Palantir is unapologetic in its support of its clients, which has, at times -- rightly or wrongly -- led to unfavorable press/protests," he wrote, alluding to the company's frequent work with intelligence agencies. 

"Further, its unique capital structure effectively creates a controlled company with three of the company's founders indefinitely controlling just under 50% of voting rights," he said. "As supply of the stock comes to market, we see these concerns potentially limiting the addressable institutional shareholder base." 

Palantir on Friday is down 3.2%, to $26.37.

This is a god damn joke lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DIS Valuation Analysis for Next 3-4 Years In my previous post post investor day, I estimated DIS to reach 200 in early 2021, and 250-300 by 2022. Now I will go one step further: **if the streaming growth sustains at 10-20M per quarter, by 2022-2024 (when they hit their 300M streaming subcriber with a profit), DIS will become the next trillion company, or >420.**

&#x200B;

Why: at 300M streaming subscriber (Disney plus, Hulu, and ESPN), suppose 100 dollar per year (consider inflation and price increase by 2023), that is 30B revenue. DIS guided about 15B cost by 2024 => 15B profit. Multiply that by 30 PE ratio gives about 500B market cap for streaming alone, which translates to $300 dollar per share conservatively.

However, investors are always forward looking. Once DIS reaches 300M streaming subscriber by or before 2024, they will be on the way to 500M subscriber. And with potential China market opening up (Bob Iger likely will be the next China ambassador, and I think DIS will benefit greatly from it, such as DIS + entering China), the subscriber potential may be as high as 1B. Even only at 500M subscriber, that is 50B revenue & >30B profit.

That will position DIS as one of the most profitable companies. Adding in its other businesses, DIS will easily worth 1 trillion or more (and whenever DIS + enters China market, it may shoot up stock by 50% in a month). **From 2021--2024, DIS may replicate its historical triple growth from 2011-2014.**

Still, it takes at least 1-2 more quarters to convince investors of the growth; and only when 300M subscriber looks pretty certain with healthy profit and future growth (1-2 years at least), then the company will worth 1 trillion sooner or later. Once the growth begin to be priced in, streaming to DIS will be valued like cloud to AMZN and MSFT.

&#x200B;

Strategy:

Stock or two-year leaps. Buy them before Q1 ER.

Why Q1ER (2021 early Feb) is important: it will be another milestone, as they have a good chance to announce another good streamimg number. Also DIS likely will beat their earning and profit estimate again (based on current Yahoo finance estimate).

In fact every ER onwards they announce good subscriber growth, stock will keep on rising. In the investor day (12.10) DIS announced 86M subscriber on 12.2. IMO they low-balled the number on-purpose ---- because Mulan is free from 12.3 onwards, and Mando just had its last episode out last week --- so 12.10 number got to be far better than 12.2. Adding in the holiday season, DIS + may announce higher number at Q1 ER (90--100M for end of 2020). Imagine what investors will be like when DIS appears to add 10M subscriber per month...also 100M subscriber will be a key level emotionally as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Oil tanker stocks for 2021 big news?

I bought Upwork only a few months ago, thinking it had great potential as a "nearing the end of the pandemic" play, where companies would begin outsourcing tasks before making the commitment to bring back full-time staff.

I've made quite a bit more money investing in Upwork that I've ever made actually using the platform, but I only have used it to pick up the odd small job.

No job, took $6,000 of my college loan refund, made $35,000 profit and possibly more. Not sure what to do with the tax situation. Help? Hi everyone,

Not a troll. I started trading this year just to see if I could make a little bit of money instead of letting it sit in my savings account and managed to make $35k+ so far in profits off of about $6k of my student loan refund. I'm confused if this fucks me over since I'm in college and have no job. Not sure if I'm getting paranoid for no reason.

Theoretically if I made $100,000+ in profits would I fuck myself over tax wise or with any penalties? Or should I just report what I can on my tax return and move on?

The stock that I made the most money off is currently projected to do really well and I'm thinking I will make substantially more. I don't want to sell yet but I do want to make sure I don't get in trouble or screw it up. After the success with mine, I later had my boyfriend do the same thing with his stocks and he made $8,000. He's not in college and is employed so we've been paying some attention to his tax bracket and capital gains tax but aren't sure what to do for my situation.

TLDR; In college with no job. Used college loans in stock market and made $35,000 profit. Is there anything special I should do for my tax return? And theoretically if I made $200,000 in profit or $1 million in profit...what would be the next steps?

Please advise_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Novice question about IPO listing day pops Hi, 
Thanks for reading my thread. I am new to this and this is probably a stupid question but, I am confused as to whether the classic “IPO listing day pop” of 10-15% or more (or a LOT more in the case of Airbnb recently) occurs: 

A) instantaneously at market opening, meaning you can only take advantage of the listing day pop if you bought shares pre-IPO through a brokerage or something because the pop happens within seconds of the market opening

or: 

B) something that happens during the actual IPO trading session, so for example within the first few minutes of the market opening, or throughout the day, so in this scenario a trader would not need pre-IPO share access in order to take advantage of the listing day pop, they could simply buy shares right at market opening like everyone else and then take advantage of the pop if one does in fact occur

If the answer is neither A nor B and is more like “it depends on the IPO/stock because they are all different” then I suppose my next question would be: 

Roughly what percentage of IPO’s have listing day pops that occur within a timeframe that is accessible to traders without pre-IPO shares? 

Do you have to lock down pre-IPO shares in order to take advantage of a listing day pop? Is it only within reach of insiders/accredited investors? Or am I overthinking this?

Thanks!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $30,000 to invest in stocks I have been reading as much as I can and listening to various podcasts for the last month and even opened up a tiny $800 wealthsimple account just to get familiar with stocks (I did zero research and just asked some people which stocks I should invest and blindly distributed the 800).

I want to educate myself more but am lost at which workshops are the most valuable. I'm pretty young and only need probably around $5000 for the next 6  months in savings so am willing to invest over $20,000 which is not much money to many but is huge for me.

1. What workshops/courses should I take? I prefer free (duh) but can put some dollars if some things are very valuable. I searched rule 1 investing on this thread and am ambivalent about it. Podcasts/Youtube information is valuable I'm sure but I definitely learn better in "course" format. This is why I'm not just googling to absorb information but I would like a more structured approach.
2. TFSA: Should you MAX your TFSA account before looking into investing in stocks outside of your TFSA limit? Are all stocks available on the TFSA market? I'm curious to why people would invest not in a TFSA if their capital gains aren't taxed in the TFSA? **For all your seasoned investors: have you max'ed out your TFSA first before you invested in stocks outside of your TFSA?**

Since the Fukushima disaster, the uranium has been bottoming non stop. So did the stocks. From over 500 miners and suppliers, only around 50 are still in business. 

The price is so low now that It became attrative again. In addition, there is no way we can achieve 100% renewable energy in the following decades without it. This is proven by research made by Bill Gates' favorite author, an energy expert named Vaclav Smil. And with around 40 new nuclear reactors being built worldwide and expansions to current ones, the demand is and will grow.

My play would be in Centrus Energy, ticker LEU. This was once a great company, with shares at ATH at around $6000. Fell pretty quickly at a few bucks and it even reached ATL at 1. Now it's rallying, being at 23. It's 200% up this year and it seems it still has space to grow. The technicals and fundamentals look promising and it's for sure undervalued.

What's your take on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBOTV Stock - signs of an irrational bull market #FUBOTV #FUBO Ok everyone. Challenge me here. FUBO goes public at $10, now trades near $40 after another analyst comes out with a bullish report and a $50 px target. What gives? Is this another sign of an irrational buyers market? Like Nikola going up because people love anything to do with EV. Seems everyone loves that FUBO is streaming and see it akin to Netflix. Let me set some facts here:

1. People keep talking about their revenue and not profit because its a tech company. Doesn't mean ignore profit! They burned well over $100m last year and there is no end in sight to the bleeding. What then after they burn all their IPO money? Another dilutive offering?

2.They are not Netflix. They are a vMVPD. That is a CABLE TV company that provides their service via streaming ala AT&T TV, Philo, Sling, Hulu Live, and the now defunct PS Vue. They are not Roku, they are not Netflix. And where has this industry gone? NOWHERE. The sub counts for these services still meander in low single digit millions. They keep raising prices bc they have the same issues as traditional cable. It's expensive to bundle traditional TV content, and traditional content is declining in viewership.

3. Fundamentals are a wreck. Burn $100m plus a year. Only had $9m in cash pre-IPO (that's insane for a company to have only $9m in the bank...seriously talk about liquidity risk). They've raised a ton of VC rounds, but frankly they seem to just be spent on keeping afloat with a measley 500k subs. They took out a PPP loan (red flag). And the most troubling is their margins are challenged. Why? Bc they're cable TV! Their gross margin  is flat (look at their S-1) because TV content is expensive. For every customer that pays say $50 in subscription Fubo pays about $50 to the programmers. It's not a fixed cost. And they spend probably $50 in marketing to acquire that sub. Now bake in all the fixed overhead of keeping the lights on and the tech platform....explain to me how they turn a profit? Advertising? Not enough. Sports gambling? You're still a cable TV company. Show me. The only way is to continue price increases just as they have been and every cable TV company has, and you know where that is headed...

4. And in closing. Let's see, Sling's sub numbers have been flattish now. AT&T TV NOW is declining. YouTube TV is the only one meaningfully growing but they also are owned by a company with deep pockets (hello Google) and losing money on a live TV experiment with the end goal of empowering their overall ad business is a drop in the bucket for them. Remember PS Vue? They had a decent number of subs. They shut down because...well cable TV is not profitable and they threw in the towel. You have to compare FuboTV to these guys. That's their comp base. Don't compare them to Roku and Netflix. I don't understand where people come off thinking they will skyrocket. Why because like Disney+ and NFLX they're going to get millions and millions of subscribers? People are canceling cable, not adding cable....FuboTV is...cable...

FedEx crushed earnings but still dropped as investors looked for guidance. What to expect from Nike after the close? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw another great day for the stock market with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vQZKh9Y) leading the way up 0.84%, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r2K5TXj) also up 0.58% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/j5MYhLG) up almost half a percent, as all 3 big indexes closed at new a record high. We also saw de [VIX](https://ibb.co/P6dnhX7) dropping below 22, as it dropped 2.5%.

Almost 2/3 of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SsV2KG6) were advancing yesterday with over 200 new highs on average volume, as 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yhc1562) in the SP500 were in the green with only energy and communications losing ground for the day, as small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g7zCvs9) while large-caps were flat for the day.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/bdFGb96) that yesterday was a good day for most of the stock market, while only a couple of companies lost significant ground like Boeing, AT&T and Google, while Tesla rose again ahead of the SP500 inclusion.

Important economic data also came in, as initial jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/dJQv6d0) rose even more from the previous week by more than 20k, while the continuing jobless claims fell to 5.5M, lower than expected and the last week number. I think it is possible we can see the initial claims jump to over 900K in the next weeks as the economy feels more pressure from the rising cases numbers and more restrictions.

Meanwhile, we also got the December Kansas City FED [INDEX](https://ibb.co/L6zW9Zp) reading, that came in at +14, above the estimates and the numbers from November. But this is still more than 10 points down from last year’s reading, while the Philly Fed [outlook](https://ibb.co/LJwCCpT) came in worse than expected and last month’s reading.

We also got numbers from November housing [starts](https://ibb.co/jvcyWyV), as this came in with a more than 1% increase month over month, bigger than expected, as building permits also jumped more than 6% to over 1.6M.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2hMmxy3) there is not a lot of important economic data that will come in, as the outlook for the economy remains very uncertain at the moment, as the economy needs to survive until enough people get the shot so we can reach herd immunity, which will allow business to come back again, as restrictions will go away.

We also saw Moderna receive the [FDA](https://ibb.co/fqC4Qys) Ad Com endorse the vaccine with a 20 to 0 vote and 1 abstention.

So, today is a big day, today is quadruple witching day and also the last day that Tesla is not included in the SP500. It’s [expected](https://ibb.co/ZVQ9MRR) that there will be over $80B worth of shares trading hands today, as they will become the most valuable company ever to enter the main index on Wall Street. This will also force index-tracking funds and money managers to buy Tesla shares to correctly reflect the index, while also selling positions in other companies that are part of the SP, as Tesla will account for over 1% of the index starting Monday.

Meanwhile, the company also just received an [upgrade](https://ibb.co/mHnpZHb) on its crediting rating from S&P Global ratings as they noted that Tesla’s net debt is essentially zero based on key metric, DEBT to EBITDA.

So, expect some massive volume to be traded in Tesla in the final minutes before the close today, Tesla is already the most traded [stock](https://ibb.co/1XZ58xj) on Wall Street and has surged more than 50% since the SP news came out. I think either outcome is possible as we can see either the stock heading to new highs or see a decent correction if bears prevail. Just watch out for the closing of the session today.

This is will be key moment for the stock market, with the FED also coming out today with the latest round of stress [tests](https://ibb.co/26CZDCh) for the banks. I don’t expect any surprises coming from here, as they were found to be able to weather big capital losses last time around in the summer.

In some other stock market news, [FedEx](https://ibb.co/ZVmggDG) delivered great earnings results, delivering a beat of more than 80 cents on EPS, while it also saw a bigger increase in revenue than expected, with a more than $1B beat and the operating margin coming in pretty much as expected.

The net income and earnings per share more than [doubled](https://ibb.co/vV7FTbv) since last year after rate hikes and spiking volume from e-commerce shipments, as the company has seen a boom alongside the e-commerce growth. But this was not enough to help the stock, as it dropped 3% in after-hours, as the lack of a formal guidance kind of disappointed investors, as they did not offer an improved [outlook](https://ibb.co/C1LFVDf) for FY2021 and the capital spending is still expected to surpass $5B.

While today we also get [Nike](https://ibb.co/s15BfJH) earnings after the close, as the company is expected to have a lower EPS than last year, but to increase the revenues by more than 1%. Nike is a great company and the world largest sportswear company, and I expect them to deliver on these expectations as its digital strategy is offsetting much of the lost retail sales after massive investments in technology that are transforming its business.

Some expected [news](https://ibb.co/qMs6xv5) also came in from Coca-Cola as they will cut more than 1K jobs in the US and more than 2K worldwide. This is another move that is looking to improve the efficiency of the company, as they have been hit alongside the restaurant business.

While Doordash fell [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LCdsSN1), after the short sellers from citron research called it the most ridiculous IPO of the year, giving the company a Price Target of $40. I usually don’t agree with such drops after short sellers make some statements or publish something, this is a common-used tactic by them, they get into a stock and publish a report that sees the stock plunge as the make money. But I kind of have to agree with them on this one, the valuation for Doordash is just ridiculous, but I don’t see it going down that much…

In comparison, investors seem to like [ABNB](https://ibb.co/F47f56X) somewhat more than DASH, as AirBNB traded higher, but still has a ridiculous valuation, bigger the BP, FedEx or even Deere, despite negative margins with more competition and new lawsuits from different cities in the world.

[https://ocs.ca/pages/data-insights](https://ocs.ca/pages/data-insights)

Weed is back in favor folks and should be in strong play next year both in Canada (where it's been legal since 2018) and definitely in the States where it's state by state (there's about 40 states where it's legal in one form or another) but the Dems have a good shot at capturing the Senate with the GA run offs in January so accelerated Federal Legalization if that happens.

My favorite Canadian LP (License Provider) is VFF (they sell under PSF and are currently the #1 brand for dried flower in OCS per above link). They also have presence in the states and are ready to go once it's federally legal to do so.

For the States right now, you need to go with an MSO (multi state operator) which are all trading OTC right now b/c of the federally illegal thing.  They're going gang busters as of late and you really can't go wrong with any of them right now.  If you're unsure, look at the MSOS etf.

Good luck. I think weed is one of those generational opportunities.  Obviously, picking the right horse is key but I think we're still early in a multi-hundred-billion dollar global industry so definitely lots of money to be made here.  I think you definitely want to have your ticket before the US legalizes at the Federal level.

About hold overnight. I understand that If I hold stock overnight, and I sell it today. I shouldn't day trade today, isn't it?  
And then I can day trade tomorrow.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

For example, This is RIGHT  
Day 1 BUY 100 shares of abc stocks (equal most balance)  
Then hold overnight  
Day 2 SELL 100 shares of abc stocks  
Day 3 BUY and SELL several times of ABC stock

This is WRONG  
Day 1 BUY 100 shares of abc stocks (equal most balance)  
Then hold overnight  
Day 2 SELL 100 shares of abc stocks, then BUY and SELL several times of abc stock in that day

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Please help answer some questions 😖 So I owned 7000 shares of this stock and decided to sell it at a good price and did made make a profit. But I didn't realise I sold it twice which turned out that I short-sold the stock (-7000 shares). I didn't realise until later that day after the stock soared by 60+% which cost me to lose quite a sum of money. I was planning to wait a few days until it drops back down so I can already break even but the very next day they forced me to buy 7000 shares back to balance the portfolio which is not fair. I own a TFSA registered account which does not allow short selling to happen in the first place. I later read the direct investment agreement and I found out that you can't even short sell a stock that is below $3 CAD or USD. That's two factors that will backup my argument. 

I then call them and they too said that it's not supposed to happen, probably some technical issues and they tried to offer me a few free future transaction fees..I was like hell no. If it's the banks technical problems I shouldn't have to suffer the blow. They then escalated the complaint to a more superior level.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/exclusive-us-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic--sources-say-13798692_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I've been swing/day trading for years and didn't do wash sales/Form 8949 this whole time. Instead I simply entered my yearly gain/loss as short-term gains. What am I in for? For the past few years I've been swing/day trading ETFs such as XIV, SVXY, and now TQQQ with Interactive Brokers. Sometimes I'll enter/exit/re-enter within a day and sometimes I'll hold for weeks. I've always had >$25k in my account so PDT rules never applied so I figured I was free to trade at will.

As for taxes, I've always just entered my yearly Profit/Loss after fees as a single summarized entry in short-term capital gains tax through HR Block's automated system, and I've never failed to have federal or state accept my tax return. The wash sales report confused me on year one and I never really looked back.

The thing is now I'm looking through my wash sales on form 8949's and am a little concerned. The numbers are all over the place and have little correlation with how much I made or lost that year.

[See chart.](https://i.imgur.com/4TRMpnZ.png)

In green is what I based my short-term capital gains entry on. I just put the P/L entry in there and that's it. Last year I entered a gain of $2332. Over the last 5 years I've made $20,806 (2020 is looking to be a profit of $12k as of today).

In red is what is listed in Form 8949 items (g) and (h) for Box A and Box B. You can see they're all over the place with wash sales (g). Also for some reason in 2015-2017, my broker reported all the trades (all box A, no box B), but in 2018-2019 they only reported part of the trades (most are in box B).

Either way, what does this mean? Should I input my stuff differently for 2020? Do I owe short-term capital gains tax (harhar, that's several times my net worth) on $1.5M of gains? Is the (h) column my actual gain/loss and I overreported my profits by $14.1k ($20.8-$6.7k), thus I should send in revisions for a refund?

***Overview:***

Well for those of you living under a rock, MMEDF aka Mind Medicine is a company that makes, discovers, and develops medical psychedelics. These have become much more popular over the last year as countries and states like Oregon have legalized them. Let's jump right into my analysis.

***The fall:***

Back before the Great Depression, the government had very loose regulation on drugs and a child even 11 years old could buy cigars if they wanted to. But then everything came crashing down, these did too as concerns grew but some people speculate the economy was only kept afloat by drug money.

***The rise:***

The economy has been bleeding an insane amount of money in the last 12+ years. The way the states get more funding for their programs is by taxes and other fines. By legalizing drugs it gives the states a crazy amount more in taxes and saves money by taking it away from prisons, etc. Also with more people getting these products from illegal areas, it gives the user more protection. In addition, with rising medical problems that can be treated with drugs like this, it's no wonder why they have legalized it.

***The company:***

This company is very small compared to other biotech companies and has pretty bad financials. They do have an LSD trial going in which can make them bucket loads of money but that is far far away. Getting a phase 3 trial is very hard. Then they need funding, resources, and support from medical professions. They are lacking in those three areas. But on the bright said they have an excellent executive team and a great shareholder base which I'm sure is 90 aut ists. Even if it gets passed the FDA there is a long way to go before the product gets into the user's hand and cash into theirs. With all this, there is a lot of the market up for grabs as there aren't many competitors.

***Summary:***

The company has a great team, shareholders, and a market up for grabs. Although their chances are against them. It is very likely they will have a merger with a bigger corp that can take this to the user.

So basically for options, long pays premium to short.

I have the following problem:

ARKK is now around $126. Being an ETF implies this option will probably expire without meeting strike price. (very not likely to spike 11% a day)

Why would anyone buy ARKK201218P140000 at $13.5 and why aren't more people shorting this option to earn the premium, even if shorting at buy price at $13.5 it would also mean $1350 very-low-risk money return.

(risky opinion don't try at home)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pure speculation about market crash + cruise stocks As Matthew McConaughey said in Wolf of Wall St, you absolutely cannot predict the stock market or time it. However, I do think it's possible to make somewhat educated guesses based on being informed about news, politics, and economy.

That said, I'm curious about whether you think a crash might be coming, and if cruise stocks might be worth buying with the vaccine rolling out, balanced by the fact that it'll still be a LONG while before things get back to "normal."

This is just an invite to speculate :) I also posted this in r/investing just b/c I want to see what people think. I've read the rules and hopefully this post doesn't violate any..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock pitch: Service Corporation International (SCI) Leading provider of deathcare services, funerals, cremations, etc.

They sell pre-need funerals (work life insurance for the business) and at need funerals.

They consolidated many funeral homes and now have about 20% market share with the next largest player at 5%. The secret sauce is they are able to leverage back office costs across many funeral homes to improve profitability and have more stable financials from the law of large numbers.

I can’t imagine Amazon or Tesla replacing their business. Additionally America is likely to get older over time meaning the demographics are moving in their favor. Additionally I imagine getting permits for competing funeral homes would be challenging when the local market is saturated.

They are not tied to the economy, consistently have an ROE of 25-26% and are selling below their historical multiples.

Thoughts? 💭_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla Stock Jumps On Credit Rating Bump Ahead Of S&P 500 Inclusion S&P Global Ratings bumped up its credit rating for **Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) closer to investment grade ahead of the automaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index on Monday. Tesla stock rose to a record high.

S&P Global raised the [**Tesla**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-is-it-a-buy-now/) rating to BB from BB- with a positive outlook. The ratings agency notes that equity share sales in 2020 — totaling $12.3 billion — have boosted liquidity and reduced the company's financial risk.

"As a result, Tesla's net debt is essentially zero," the ratings agency. "Based on a key credit metric, debt to EBITDA, our assessment of financial risk has reduced substantially. With more cash on its balance sheet than debt, the company appears easily able to fund its global expansion in China and Europe, and broaden its U.S. manufacturing base by opening a facility in Austin, Texas. Moreover, this cushion of cash will help the company navigate through the ongoing economic impact from the resurgence of COVID-19."

But the agency also said risk-adjusting its assessment to include significant future uncertainties, such as slower-than-expected rate of electric vehicle adoption and fierce competition. 

"Tesla will need to address intensifying competition as global automakers are expected to launch roughly 20-25 new EV models by the end of 2021," the report said. Larger automakers like **Volkswagen** ([**VWAGY**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) and **Toyota** ([**TM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), and luxury carmaker **BMW** ([**BMWYY**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMWYY)) and **Daimler** ([**DMLRY**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DMLRY)), could be formidable competitors, the agency said.

S&P Global Ratings expects Tesla deliveries of more than 470,000 in 2020.

I literally have never been able to save up any cash. For some reason, if it is in my account I just kind of use it. I've tried so many times. When I found stocks this changed completely, because now I spend the cash buying stocks and building wealth. Honestly, I get so much enjoyment from this, and it is the first time I've actually build any kind of wealth with my money.  


Has anyone else noticed this "side" effect? Or is it just me that is a degenerate? :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRM a buy or past it’s peak? Been looking into diversifying the portfolio recently and wanted to go into some information stocks. Was looking at CRM but with their soon to be acquisition with SLACK and returning to a pre-COVID environment in the near future (near as a loose term), I’m trying to decide if it’s worth an investment_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gilead...should I buy more? I had planned to buy more of a few stocks. Well, money is tighter than I’d like. I can get 2 shares of Pfizer or 1 of Gilead. Both are lower than their potential. Recent setbacks. 

I can’t help but think Gilead might be going into a death spiral...even remdesivir is going to get me-too’d soon. With the vaccines, I feel like that’s a more guaranteed revenue....

Pfizer: vaccines =$. Storage needs and the extra doses = less $. But net $$$. Stock took a dip today but I like this company still. And didn’t they make Viagra? That’s innovation man, convincing guys it’s not them, it’s a medical issue! Lol. Side effect turned into $$$$. 

Gilead: treatment for the really sick =$. But bad study results and WHO not recommending = less $. The vaccines = less $ than might have been. I mean, more people are sick than we would ever hope, but pretty soon the $ will dry up. Some other company had a me-too drug in the pipelines, I forgot which one. Also, the recent bad news for the arthritis drug = no $ in US markets. Something just got approved, but I didn’t read the article._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Websites that let us track q reports and investor days for stocks? Hi all just wondering if there are any helpful websites that allow us to see and keep track of upcoming events for individual stocks eg. there quarterly reports or investor days?

For example how Blackberrys Q3 reports were recently released if there is a website that provides us with that date as soon as it’s made public in one easy to track place?
Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Breakthrough in EV Battery Technology. Early last week [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/quantumscape-solid-state-battery/) was published about QuantumScape's, a Volkswagen ~~and Toyota~~ backed startup, announcement of a breakthrough in their solid-state battery development. Some of the biggest difficulties facing EV car and battery producers are supposedly going to be solved by this breakthrough including slow charging, capacity loss, short battery range, and flammability. More details are in the article, so I won't post them here.

Since Tesla's all the rage (sorry to bring it up again, but everyone's doing it!) how does everyone see them being impacted by this? It's often said by Tesla supporters that its advanced battery technology is one of its moats that is keeping it ahead of the competition, but with this and the range of new EVs, like the [Lucid Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Air) topping hitting 517 miles per charge, is that gap narrowing?

Would love to see both sides of the Tesla debate weigh in. I'll grab popcorn in the meantime._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where to move oil gains? I, like so many others, started investing when the market tanked at the beginning of COVID. I haven’t done amazingly well, but managed to be up about 35% total over that time. Part of that success has been through HAL (up 85% ish) but I’m curious if the appointment of a new Biden EPA head and a new regime in general signal time to move that oil money elsewhere, like renewables or tech. 

It isn’t much money in HAL, about $800 at time of posting, but it could do a lot of of good elsewhere. Happy to entertain suggestions and do my DD on anything posted._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GUSH a good buy? Would you say Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp & Prod Bl 2X Shs (GUSH) is a good buy right now? It’s been sitting at about $40 a share but historically was up to $1,602 with the low about $12.

In fact, MRNA took a dip at today's announcement that the FDA is recommending emergency approval.

Everyone is saying tesla is a bubble, but it's P/S ratio is less than 25. There are plenty of stocks out there like snowflake with P/S ratios in the multiple 100s.

I think 25 is a little high premium to pay, but tesla has so much future value, cult gathering, and media coverage to not be as overvalued as everyone thinks. What are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
