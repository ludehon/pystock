First off I need to start by saying that I hate investing in a firm that is in a duopoly. I say that because in my experience firms will try again and again to beat out their competition. A great example of this is fedex vs ups. While both companies have performed well this year (as a direct result of covid) long term trends are not in their favor. these companies will both go back to fighting for market share and pricing one another out. Another one is Visa and Mastercard (in this case the winner is Amex). At the end of the day in most duopolies the winner is the consumer.

With that being said with the initial ipo of both uber and lyft I planned on staying far away from the two. However, recently I have come to realize that uber is a much different business than lyft. Lyft is entirely focused on giving rides while uber is simply focused on transportation. Think for a second about Uber you have Uber eats, raid hailing, and uber freight. I think the most slept on aspect of their business is uber freight it’s a revolutionary platform for drivers to find new freight deliveries. 

I almost never hear anyone even bring this aspect of their business up when talking about uber. In addition to freight we still have uber eats and regular uber. I don’t like uber eats at all. This will continue to be a losing sector until it becomes automated (which they are investing heavily in). That is simply because it costs uber more to send an order than they are being paid for that order. I will say the same for doordash. When they have an ipo I promise you it will bust. No food delivery company will ever be profitable until the drivers are completely cut out of the equation. Finally we have regular old uber the bread and butter of the business. The initial problem with this was regulations. However, in a town that recently allows ubers we almost always see DUI related accidents go down so there is a really good argument to allow uber into any town. I believe there is really not a good reason to deny uber entrance into a new jurisdiction. The main factor that causes a city to deny uber to operate is because of bad behavior from drivers. This is a simple fix with more intensive background checks and well eventually autonomous vehicles (which again they are putting a lot of money into). 

Let's talk about financials. 

Bad news first. **Uber is not profitable** and I can’t entirely explain to you as to why that is. Other than the fact that startup costs are very high I can not give you a finite reason as to why they are losing so much money. For a software company they have a very high percentage of expenses being debited to administrative and general I think this could easily be reduced but I was unable to figure out why exactly this number is so high for a firm that is basically an app.

P/E ratio: 27.03--- really fucking bad

Price/Sales ratio: 26.85 --- terrible

Unfortunately those ratios have gotten worse over the last 12 months and I respect anyone who avoids Uber solely based off of those numbers because that’s not a good sign. 

Now for the good news.

Uber has seen an increase in users, an increase in revenue, and an increase in market share over every period to date. This is a really good sign and very few companies can say the same. Basically Uber is taking heavy losses at the moment to expand the market as well as their market share. In addition to that i'm sure you already have heard about California legislation that passed in favor of uber/lyft. This was huge for the company and really will shape the future of how they will operate.

Now let’s talk about COVID

As you could imagine corona has had a big impact on uber stock. However, don’t forget about the eats sector. This part has seen triple digit growth and is more than enough to keep uber afloat. Once we have this virus behind us Uber will be in high demand and we could see some really great numbers coming next year. 

TL;DR: Uber has a debt problem, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If Uber can reduce administrative expenses while keeping a large budget for R&D the road to profitability would be much shorter than Wall Street might imagine.

Youc can look these things up very easily, but decided to put some of them here.

- It’s real estate portfolio is well exposed to many industries. Mostly in convenience stores and drug stores. They have about 600 tenants
 
- They are also exposed to the UK, which is nice. It indicates that they are activeky trying to grow their area of influence outside the US.

- Their net debt is about 27% of their enterprise value, which I think is fine. They aren’t too badly on debt.

- They have a VERY solid dividend. They are one of the S&P 500’s dividend aristocrats. They were able to keep a steady dividend and annual growth during 2007-2009, which were of course very hard years in the stock market. They pay a MONTHLY dividend, which I think many of us know already.

- Their theaters are doing a bit badly, since all of their tenants aren’t paying their rent. I think this happened a few months ago. 51% of their theaters are closed. If AMC goes bankrupt, this will take a hit under their belt.

- They have a strategy, which works in the long-term. I think yous should be in it for the long term.

In short, this is a long-term, conservative and well diversed REIT company with good dividends.

Hi All,

I have started some researches about stocks and would like to buy few.

My objective is clear, to buy stocks with a fixed capital to start my investments. Then, every month, a small portion of my salary will be dedicated to buy stocks of the companies that I've targeted. I will not monitor the prices or anything, I'll simply buy stocks, get dividends, and reinvest. 

The only issue is I don't know which platform or institution to trust for having and keeping stocks over the long term (20/30 years). In addition, I'd like to not pay expensive fees to simply buying or keeping stocks (quick researches about traditional banks show they are more expensive than online brokers on average). I know this might sounds pretty naive but, if it exists a broker which meets all my requirements it would be brilliant. 
Do you know or recommend a broker that can survive 20 years, possesses low fees and is reliable? 

I'm currently living in Poland, and would like to use either an international broker/institution or English speaking services (I'm not Polish).

Last but not least, I'm experienced with the financial markets (few years of small Forex trading), but I want to buy stocks moving forward.

Thanks for any advice,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ US tells GM to recall nearly 6 million trucks with Takata air bag inflators https://abc7chicago.com/automotive/us-tells-gm-to-recall-nearly-6m-trucks-with-takata-air-bag-inflators/8199036/

DETROIT, Michigan -- The U.S. is making General Motors recall and repair nearly 6 million big pickup trucks and SUVs equipped with potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators.

The decision announced Monday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will cost the automaker an estimated $1.2 billion, about one third of its net income this year.

GM had petitioned the agency four times starting in 2016 to avoid a recall, contending the air bag inflator canisters have been safe on the road and in testing. But owners say the company has placed a priority on profits, not safety.

Exploding Takata inflators caused the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 63 million inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that as of September, more than 11.1 million had not been fixed. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide.

The recall covers GM full-size pickup trucks and SUVs from the 2007 through 2014 model years, including the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickups. The Silverado is GM's top-selling vehicle and the second-best selling vehicle in the U.S. Also covered are the Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe and Avalanche, the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Sierra 1500, 2500 and 3500, and the GMC Yukon.

Takata used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to fill air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to heat and humidity and explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel.

Twenty-seven people have been killed worldwide by the exploding inflators including 18 in the U.S._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long term investors.

DEA scheduling: Schedule 2 (Oct. 30)

Currently holding virtual press conferences in lieu of sales reps due to Covid. Rumors are good.

Early reports that Olinvyk could partially replace Morphine were skeptical. Now new studies show significant advantages over morphine. 

CHESTERBROOK, Pa., Nov. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trevena, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRVN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines for patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced a publication, titled “Oliceridine is Associated with Reduced Risk of Vomiting and Need for Rescue Antiemetics Compared to Morphine: Exploratory Analysis from Two Phase 3 Randomized Placebo and Active Controlled Trials,” with lead author Tim Beard, M.D., Chair of the Department of Surgery at Summit Medical Group (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00216-x).
The results of this analysis highlight an improved gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability profile, with OLINVYK demonstrating a ~2-3x likelihood of achieving a “complete GI response” compared to IV morphine under equianalgesic conditions. A complete GI response is defined as the proportion of patients who complete the study without vomiting and without using any antiemetics.
“There are multiple types of procedures where post-operative nausea or vomiting can disrupt the integrity of a surgery, posing a significant challenge to a patient’s recovery,” said Tim Beard, M.D. “Based on the results of this analysis, OLINVYK has the potential to greatly reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting following surgery, compared to IV morphine. These are compelling findings that suggest the clinical advantages OLINVYK may offer in the post-operative acute care setting.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you think of my portfolio strategy? Need answers on some ”stupid questions”...

Is it worth buying just a few stocks, which are relatively expensive? I’d be looking to get more consistantly, but I’m able to get a little at a time.

So I’m 16 and going to start investing in December. I’m going to put around 1000-1500 euros at the start, but not dumping everything at once. The account would be in my parents’ name or one of my parent’s name, but I’d be getting the account once I’m 18. So nothing illegal. 

So the main point: Is it bad if I have just a few stocks from some companies? I know the fractions would be very small, but I think I’ll be able to get 1500-2000 euros + dividends (which are small) a year to slap in to the account. Or my parents would put that money in there. I’d have pretty decent portfolio in 5 years or so. Nothing huge, but I think decent.

Here’s what my portfolio would be looking at the moment. I’m probably going to get one or two companies more which would mean about 500 euros more to invest. Pretty much all of these will be long term investments except for the growth stocks, which will come and go a little bit more. Anyway, this is my portfolio plan atm.

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as "the internet of cars".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks.

Here is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it’s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)

Next week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick’s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)

Also, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI’s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).

The worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)

Some great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%.

Moving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)

Just take care and don’t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years. With Boeing being another company that might struggle in the short-term but for the long-term I believe is still a great company to own as they are expected to also have the 737 max banning lifted in Europe in the next couple of months.

Also, car makers are getting more and more stamps of approval as they transition into the EV world, as 2 big Detroit giants GM and Ford are making a huge push to compete in the EV market with Tesla. The most recent was a buy rating from UPS on GM as they set the price at 50$ which implies a 16% upside.[NEWS](https://ibb.co/R3Y0WBP)

Just a quick mention as Netflix saw its stock up more than 1,5% on Friday as the company has struggled to regain momentum after weaker than expected growth in the last earnings report and has been dragged down by people selling the company after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine news. I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers.

So guys stay safe for the holidays as danger is still around, with the CDC urging people to not travel at home and also be safe while investing as the rift between the Treasury and the Fed may bring some volatility to the market unless a stimulus is passed by the time Biden taxes over even if the programs that will not be extended are not critical for the economy as they acted more like a backup in case of emergency. I believe the US should take the same approach as the UK which plans to present its biggest borrowing plan since World War Two.

Don’t rush into the market if you missed the rally until now as I believe there are a lot of people who kept cash on the sidelines and missed the best moments to invest this year as the human mind plays tricks on us, just try to stay sharp and not put all your eggs in one basket. Be diversified and choose great companies as I believe we might see the market going up until the end of the year  as December has been one of the best performing months for the stock market over the time, with stocks seeing the Santa Claus effect almost every year while we also have to wait and see if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th of December which I believe will be a good catalyst for the market as it has traded sideways. Today we also got news that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail has just received emergency use authorization from the FDA, this is the drug that was administered to Trump and made him have a quick recovery from the illness.

The analyst also raised his Bull Case to $1000 from $800 to reflect this steeper demand EV adoption curve over the next 18 to 24 months for Tesla with China and Europe the linchpins of growth.

>	"With the sustained path to profitability and S&P 500 index inclusion achieved, the Tesla bull story is now all about a stepped up EV demand trajectory into 2021," Ives commented. "Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with Giga 3."

Why wouldnt I set the strike price lower lets say at 18 so I coule exercise the contract at a lower price meaning I could make more profit?

Why wouldnt I set the expiring date later giving me more chance of the stock getting higher(ignoring the lock up period in this example)? Is the profit calculated off the time left?

How is the profit calculated if I exercise the contract or if I do not exercise it?

Hi all, I am new to stock investing and am interested in the company Chargepoint which will be going public through SBE. SBE at $26.16 a share, its market cap is at $1.03 billion. Given that the current shareholder of SBE will be control 10.3% of Chargepoint after the merge, does this mean the current evaluation of Chargepoint to be over $10 billion? 

Or should the calculation be $26.16 (current SBE stock price) multiply by 304.9 million (number of share Chargepoint will issue after the merger)? This will total around $7.97 billion. 

from research, it seems like Chargepoint is making $150 in revenue in 2019 and expected to grow at 60% per year to $2 billion a year (base case scenario). Is this overvalued?

Thx_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up 1.9% for the week. Here are my plays this week: FB, KR, MSFT, NVDA, SHOP. r/Stocks, I've been tracking my performance the last several weeks by selling theta and occasionally entering share positions. I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.

**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**

&#x200B;

|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|
|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|
|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

&#x200B;

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.

This is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta & delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**FB - Facebook**

Facebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks.

Break-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).

OR

100x shares

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KR - Kroger**

Kroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.

**Plays on the watch:**

Dec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.

OR

IV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.

&#x200B;

**MSFT - Microsoft**

Classic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.

OR

Buying shares and selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

**NVDA - Nvidia**

I am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.

&#x200B;

**SHOP - Shopify**

Shopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.

&#x200B;

I'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.

Time to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.

&#x200B;

**MONDAY 11AM - UPDATE**

I normally post screenshots, but it's not allowed in this sub-reddit. Here are the positions I've enter.

FB - December 18 $260 put. $600 premium collected.

KR - purchased 500 shares and sold 5 covered calls for Dec 11, $34 strike for $300 premium collected.

MSFT - purchased 100 shares

NVDA - purchased 30 shares

SHOP - purchased 15 shares.

The market took a little dip and my positions are down $400 for the day. No need to stress, I'm a HODLer anyways.

I've been spending my night looking at these sites, and know there's something here I can use with my limited mental abilities to be smarter about trading, but need the help of some folks smarter than I, such as you fine folks, to point me in the right direction.

For example, when I look at the tends of users purchasing stocks, I see that the price of a stock tends to dip when the trend line of ownership exceeds the price of a stock... so if that was to start happen, one might assume a dip is coming. Maybe?

Some of the criteria I look at includes: 

1. Revenues/Earnings: I am usually more interested in if a company is growing revenues year-over-year versus earnings. The newer the company, the less I am worried about its EPS and P/E ratio. 
2. Market Cap: Do I see potential for the stock's value to continue raising or does it feel like the company is grossly overvalued relative to its revenues/earnings? 
3. Industry: I like to buy companies where I can see a growing/expanding industry or if there is a specific catalyst that will propel the stock forward over a certain time period (ex: oil stocks when Covid goes away).
4. Analyst Ratings: In general I trust the consensus on the analyst's buy/hold/sell ratings and their price targets. My opinion is they probably know more about the stock as it is their job to evaluate companies. 
5. Volume: I usually don't like stocks with a super high volume because I feel like they are very volatile and a lot of the trading is from pump-and-dumpers or day traders. Exception is if it's a huge, well-established company that has had high volume for awhile. 

Overall I've earned more relative to the overall market since March and my current holdings include AMZN, BABA, SHOP, AVGO, DKNG, CRM, PTON, FANG, APHA. Does anyone see any flaws in my thinking or what are some main criteria that you look for? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Capital Gains Tax Question Hi, all! I'd like to check my understanding of how the U.S. Long Term Capital Gains Tax applies to stocks. Here's my scenario.

I purchased a certain amount of stock two years ago. I want to begin using it to pad my income via a yearly withdrawal based on a percentage of the stock's value increase in each given year. My plan is to continue siphoning off the top while leaving enough to account for inflation each year so that the principal is maintained. If a year goes negative, no withdrawal.

So, to use a fake example, imagine I bought $1000 worth of stock. It goes up 5% this year, giving me a total of $1050. I withdraw 2.5% ($26.25) to my bank account. I leave the other 2.5% of the profit to account for inflation and then some. I keep doing this each year.

My question is this: would each of these yearly withdrawals be taxed at the Long Term Capital Gains rate? Would I only pay 20% + state tax each time in perpetuity?

I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything because I'm fairly new to stocks as a form of investment. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taxes! Ok I have 15k in wash sale(did the math) I have done about 950 trades this year and will keep it under 1,000(did the math) i have 6700 in realized gains and 8300 in unrealized. I will sell a zm call and pton because both contracts expire before dec 31 2020.. so in reality I have 8k in realized gains as of now when I sell those. My question is, the rest of my holdings, if I sell those jan 1 2021. I pay taxes on April 2022 and 8k will be for April 2021... stuck between using my accountant or turbo tax. Anyone else ever expirance this same situation? Rest of my holdings are various shares but most im ENPH, may 95 calls 2021 and jan 125 2022 call.... any advice is welcomed... I hope I am fucked for taxes_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Breaking News: Cyberpunk 2077 footage was Leaked online &#x200B;

It's no secret that Cyberpunk 2077 release is a very material event for CD Projekt ($OTGLY). I have about $125,000 worth of shares and following anything that happens with that company online. Cyberpunk 2077 will be released on Dec 10th.

Gaming footage was release from people working in retail who stole the game for their own pleasure. There is also reports that Amazon has received physical copies.

So the big news from the leak is:

1. No further delays. Physical copies are out there. This was a big worry since the game was delayed 4 times. So I expect the price to jump since that risk is no longer there.
2. Game looks crisp!!
3. These leaks do not include the 0-day patches.
4. People have spend 180 hours playing the game and there is plenty of material to play.
5. There is a Mike Tyson cameo
6. System requirements are decent

Checking out the number of active users of [r/cyberpunkgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/) for hype and they have 439k members and 8.1k are online. Comparing that to [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) there are 1600k members and 12k are online.

Just the fact that we know the game is not going to be further delay should give us an edge compared to slow Wallstreet analysts who will take a whole week to update their pricing models.

I found an amazing write up about the company here by these guys:
