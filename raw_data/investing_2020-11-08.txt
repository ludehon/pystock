Leverage on BND. Is it too good to be true? The prerequisite is that LIBOR is below 0.5 so that I can margin with sub 2 percent interest rate according to Interactive Broker, which makes bond profitable. Actually, BND's CAGR is 4% but I will be more conservative.

Portfolio is 100% on stock + 50~100% on BND (low volatility, high sharpe, high sortino, minimum max drawdown, which turns out to be bond etf). Yes, this is leveraged from 1.5x to 2x. As everyone knows, the real risk of leverage is margin call, which forces you to liquidate at the bottom. 

But with this kind of portfolio, if my stock crash like shit so that there is a margin call, I could just liquidate BND with almost no loss(the MAX DRAWDOWN is 4% from 2008/01!), therefore I can solve the risk of margin call. Plus, the stock and bond is already hedged by nature. If the stock crash, the bond is likely at ATH. I wouldn't be mad if I had to liquidate it. It's like an arbitrage that I can cancel anytime. I know LTCM did this kind of arbitrage and eventually collapsed. But they were leveraging like crazy (20x~100x) and their tricks were more complicated. I wouldn't call this method risk-free, the risk is both stock and bond crash but is that really possible in real world?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can we be so confident of long-term ETF investment performance? Browsing Reddit and the internet in general, I understand that the most common (and safest) investing advice is to put most of one's capital into low costs index funds/ETFs tracking mainly the US stock market (SPY, QQQ etc...). The reasoning behind it is that the US stock market has historically always gone up in the long term. (ps. I think Warren Buffet even said in an interview)

The average Costco warehouse in western countries average around 60k subscriptions. In other Asian countries a warehouse might get around 100k subscriptions after 2 years of being open. 

After the Warehouse in Shanghai opened in late 2019, its subscription count grew to 250k in under 3 months. With the warehouse shutting down local traffic and being forced to close early due to the chaos that ensued on opening day. 

Costco plans on opening a second warehouse in Suzhou. And may grow more rapidly after  they gain more experience with operating in China. 

"We typically open 2-3 locations in a country, and see how they operate over the first couple of years, ... We are off to a good start with our first opening last year." - Richard Galanti, CFO, 

"It may take a couple of years to improve efficiencies. That’s one of the reasons why we generally go slow in new countries because we want to get it right from customer experience and also from the operational side," he added.

With China’s growing middle class and Costco’s brand being extremely popular among the Chinese... It could be plausible that China will end up becoming the majority of Costco’s revenue one day?

I’ve spent a fair sum of time during my investment career researching the phenomenon of post-victory market declines. Such bear markets have occurred after many large victories, to the scale of WW2, where stocks climbed to ATHs during the war itself, yet declined sharply when the dust settled, even with no change in fundamental economic outlooks.

Given the arguably even larger impact Covid has and will continue to have on the globe, and the markets gleeful reaction to the progress in fighting the virus, I can help but feel the atmosphere is of such that the decline may begin when the battle is won, as precedent has alluded.

The electric-vehicle market has plenty of room for growth in China, and Nio seems to be a key player in that market. 

China definitely is pushing for EV to become the norm, and so Nio seems is good stead to keep on with their growth being as though the market and government backing are proving favourable. 

NIO announced early in October that it had delivered 4,708 vehicles in September, an increase of 133.2% year over year. 

NIO has a market capitalization of $26.6 billion and is valued at roughly 12 times this year's expected sales. 

There’s also rumours they’re moving into Europe, planning to sell 7,000 of its ES8 and ES6 SUVs on the Continent within two years.

However unlike Tesla, NIO doesn't yet have a factory of its own; its vehicles are built under contract by Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group.

Although, as part of its "Battery as a Service" strategy, Nio also runs battery-leasing and battery-swapping services. Essentially, the car and the battery are sold separately. Subscribers to the program can rent the battery for a monthly fee.

Having said all that, Ford and voltwagen are also moving towards EVs and have much more capital and factories of their own, so could easily outpace Nio, as could Tesla.

They’ve managed to do well in the current climate with their virtual health care offering. 

It’s has seen its shares skyrocket 146% this year, soundly beating the S&P 500 and its 8.5% returns.

Virtual visits for the three-month period reached 2.8 million, a 206% increase from the prior-year period.

For perspective, Teladoc's virtual visits totaled 4.1 million for all of 2019. It's on track to smash that number this year, already reporting 7.6 million visits through the first nine months of 2020. 

As a result of the strong increase in virtual visits, Teladoc's top line also got a big boost in Q3, climbing 109% to $288.8 million

I wanted to get your opinion on investing in structured notes.  I have came across a structured note paying 16.50% P.A and it is invested in Amazon, Netflix and Facebook. It looks like a steady return with good loss protection barriers.

I understand that if the stocks go up more than the structured notes amount of given interest rate I wont profit as much as investing directly however by investing in the note you also have loss prevention barriers which you don't get directly in the stock.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have AMZN, FB, and MSFT - I want to drop one and consolidate my positions into two. Which would you choose? The case for AMZN - it can grow in so many directions and has surprised us time and time again.

The case for FB - leader in social networking. sure, they've maxed out on users, but they are opening other revenue streams with instagram.

The case for MSFT - just a steady beast. growth is not that sexy and has been a lame duck in my portfolio. Sure, Azure is hot, but it's competing with AWS, so I feel there's some duplication here. 

Honestly, I'm leaning towards dropping MSFT - getting greedy. The other side of me wants to keep MSFT because it's the "safest" out of the three.

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling "Buy me". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

$ZM 2020_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Foreign investments seem counter intuitive? I live in the UK, and facing a small conundrum.. but this can apply to anyone investing in foreign markets with another currency.

Lets say you I am investing in stocks listed on the LSE in GBP but I also want to buy stocks on the NYSE in USD.

At the moment I make a trade for US stocks, I am doing so with a certain exchange rate.

Assuming this exchange rate never changes, your profit after selling (lets say after 1 year) will only be the rise in stock price. Great, but this is unlikely. The exchange rate will go up or down.

But lets say this exchange rate rises (either as a result of a stronger GBP or a weaker USD). When I want to sell my stocks that I initially bought at the lower exchange rate, the profits are suppressed by this rise in exchange rate.

This incentivises me to want the exchange rate to get lower in order to get a higher return on my investment in US stocks.

But the paradox is that any native UK stocks I bought and sold during this time are now giving me profit (okay) but it is not worth as much because the exchange rate is lower (i.e the GBP is weaker). 

Am I missing something here? Its almost like you should just do one or the other. Doing both is like betting for 2 different and opposite outcomes, you are going nowhere.
