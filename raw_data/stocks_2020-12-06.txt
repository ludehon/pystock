Let’s talk about this and the latest stock market news**

Hey everyone! So let’s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.

We saw more than ¾ of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.

[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.

The VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.

For the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.

The big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.

Here are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.

So, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies … aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.

So, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.

This may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don’t agree on.

This is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.

Yes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don’t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.

Yes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.

Other numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.

The other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.

So next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.

I own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don’t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.

We will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.

So, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.

Also:

> Stem Inc has largely played in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment of the energy storage market, creating connected virtual power plants (VPPs) through batteries at office buildings and industrial sites, although it has also diversified into areas including utility solar-plus-storage.

> From using stored renewable energy to reduce peak demand and lower energy costs for C&I customers and using their systems to provide grid services, Stem Inc has been one of the primary movers in the energy storage-as-a-service market.

And:

Athena runs or operates around 1GWh of storage across more than 900 systems. According to Carrington, the merger and funds the transaction gives the company access to will be used to “enable expansion into several additional global markets”.

Any others I should consider ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My 2 cents around an "inevitable" crash. Just spit balling here, but is a crash really inevitable?

Traditional trading is no more. Currencies all over the world are deflating due to insane debt levels. 

Your equity is better off being tied up with something that actually adds value, like businesses. 

It doesn't really make sense to liquidate and move into a cash position that'll only deflate and lose value. 

I get that a crash is usually induced by a major sell off. But the scale of the crash back in March wasn't even that big. It crashed but relatively, it wasn't that big. And that was a freaking global pandemic, with so much uncertainty and everything shut. What would we need to top that? Nuclear war or something along those lines?

The ball game has changed and I don't think we can rely on historical trading as an accurate reference point. 

In addition to this, the wealth gap we're seeing is unprecedented. Those who are most likely to be affected by a global catastrophe and need cash, probably don't have much tied up in the stock market. 

The massive bull run we're seeing, to me sounds like simple supply and demand. Nobody wants to hold a deflating currency, so the demand for stocks naturally rises and is treated as a commodity like gold.

I'm a long term Investor and here to share thoughts on BAND. The below write-up barely covers a bit of my research on the company but I thought it should be enough for people on the lookout.

**BAND**: It's is a communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) company providing cloud-based software to integrate voice and text into online applications.To simplify, when you're voice calling or conferencing on **Zoom**, you're calling over Bandwidth's network. . **Microsoft** is also one of Bandwidth's client.

| 152M | 162M | 204M | 232M |

Average Analyst Price Target: 198Current Price: 158With most of the analysts recommending a Buy or Strong buy

**Main Competitors**: Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG), Agora (API), etc

**Advantage**: All these competitors are basically a middleman using someone else's infrastructure for example RingCentral is a Bandwidth customer so that's where Bandwidth has an advantage i.e. only Bandwidth actually owns the network infrastructure on which it's communications are run.So in short, Bandwidth can and already is pricing out the competitors but this is not even their biggest advantage but I would rather let you research that out :)

&#x200B;

**Risk**: There is a lot of catching up to do with companies like Twilio which offer an excellent service and ease of implementation. Though last mover advantage is a thing, things can still go wrong.

&#x200B;

**Future Expectations**: This is one of the stock which can take a big hit if the market tumbles so it's not for faint-hearted but the potential long term return could be sweet like catching the Moster stocks in their early days. Start with a small amount in the portfolio and load up on dips to be on the safer side but do your research first.

Does anyone know if it's possible to place an order at your broker say at 9am before it opens? Or only at 9.30? 

And for a new IPO like this would it make sense to use a Stop Limit order? E.g. at 50 with limit at 55. Using a market order seems risky.

I live in Europe so I opened Revolut account since I can't open US  accounts and I wanna invest money in stocks and crypto. I watched few videos, red few tips on internet. I am more like "try to learn" person so I have to try it to learn something.

I chose to invest small money just to see if this whole thing is something for me.

I chose to invest $10 to - Apple, Amazon and AMD.

I payed $10 for every single of those. So $30 for everything.

I payed $10 for Bitcoin and $10 for Ether. So $20 for everything.

I wanna invest each month about $30-$50. I would like to invest in - Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix, Coca-Cola, Paypal, Pepsi, AMD. I wanna keep it more Tech.  I would choose best 3 stocks to buy each month and buy them.

Do you think I chose good starting investments ? Are these too risky ? 

Let me know more tips into comments !

... ideas for the best **collaboration software** to use for **active trading** (signals, chart discussion) and **target selection** for day-trading, (mostly) swing-trading, and long-term investment.

***For...***

A **private group**, in this case - at least for now - a group of two. (Though there might be more eventually).

It's OK if the solution involves more than one tool or service. (I assume that the solution will be one or more SASS offerings.)

Neither of us trade full-time. But at times, one or both of us do focused trading. We both have other work, and so there are disconnected moments or hours, and so there is a need for both more static research-oriented writing, as well as chat which might or might not be acted upon immediately, but should be easy to navigate.

***A constraint...***

The other person (I will refer to as G) is a bit **tech-phobic** even while having once been an early-adopter. (He blames Bill Windows for losing all of the contacts on his Palm Pilot, and can never forgive him for that. If I hear the Bill Windows rant one more time...) I sometimes use this person as a guinea-pig - **if G can use it ... anybody can!**

I have yet to get G to use Zoom. Now he has, but only when it was the only way to do something. (A town meeting.) (So much easier if I can see what's on his screen as I try to explain how to do something in TWS, for example.)

I'm thinking I can get G to use some kind of screen sharing, if it is built-in to something else.

***Oh, BTW, if I can't find it...***

I am a software developer, who has now been writing code for 50 years. (first machine was an IBM 1620 in high school). Lately, mostly mobile Enterprise apps in a hybrid native environment, with some database and back-end service development thrown in.

I MIGHT be interested in writing some software for this. If so, most likely along the lines of of one or more integrations with some existing collaboration platform(s). Think: dropping in a live chart, incorporating a watch-list from some software or brokerage API. (We both use Interactive Brokers).

***What hasn't worked...***

(Well, it has, actually, monetarily. But has been tremendously frustrating.)

**Signal**. Both text and voice, on our phones and (got G to do this kicking and screaming) desktop.

The problem is, it's single-channel, important trad-able information gets buried in the endless Covid debate, and the rants about his housemates who "MUST be TALKING ALL the TIME, and MUST be on SPEAKERPHONE, and MUST come in the room when I am trading and think I am playing a VIDEO GAME, I MUST be FED constantly it is an INSULT if I do not EAT it" and *my* rants about the constant floods and package thefts in my condo building, so ya, the communication channel is noisy.

***What I was thinking...***

**Trello** for brainstorming ideas, and **Slack** for real-time communication. We've both used Trello before - it's my favorite tool for software project brainstorming, and G has used it for construction projects. I've used Slack when I've had to.

***But WHAT was I thinking?! Slack? Hell to the no!...***

But... OMG I knew there was a good reason **I hate Slack**! But I was "everyone uses Slack, I must be missing something, OK, I will give it a try.

I've only used it before because I had to because projects I've worked on used it, and have never had to actually set it up, or explain to somebody how to use it. There is the stupid thing of having a separate account or login or something for each workspace or team or whatever (EVERYONE I've ever talked to about this when they are forcing me to use Slack is like "yes, it's stupid, it's the way the stupid thing works, get over it.)

So, that's the other rule here (besides that G has to be able to figure it out). **If** ***I*** **can't figure it out, nobody can**. (Don't get me started on my city's 211 system, that no person in need could possibly ever navigate...)

***Instead of Slack...***

As an alternative, then, I'm considering **Twist** instead of Slack. Maybe it will also be suitable for the more static "research" part (as opposed to day to day chatter).

In any case, I do want some kind of channelized real-time communication. So, at least I there can be a channel e.g. for SPACs, for Catherine Wood components that haven't moved yet (G's sister sends him a constant stream of hot **BUY NOW** picks that she gets from some Russian guy who gets them from Catherine Wood's blog where she congratulates herself on the big run-up on one of her picks, which means that G's sister reliably picks near-term tops which at least are good short candidates.)

And maybe channels for individual names, for focus. A hierarchy here would be nice. So, maybe you could look at the text stream for all SPACs, or just for, say, HCAC.

Problem is  I am not a mind-reader and so can't guess what G is focusing on right now. So it's impossible for me to reduce the noise and insure that the bottom of the scroll

I should note that G legitimately has a vision disability that does make scrolling through a lot of stuff difficult.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AT&T (NYSE: T) - A stock Guide/Review # Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. AT&T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll (on r/dividends). There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed. 

# AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph:

**Sector: Communication Services** 

AT&T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments: 

* AT&T Communications: 

>AT&T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.

* AT&T International:

>AT&T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

* AT&T ad and analytics:

>Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.

* Warner Media’s HBO & Turner and Warner Bros divisions:

>Warner Media’s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world’s largest TV and film studio.

**Strengths:**

>\- Acquisitions have added to AT&T’s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).   
>  
>\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).   
>  
>\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)

**Risks:**

>\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   
>  
>\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   
>  
>\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. 

# Financial History:

Before diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. 

This first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. 

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|
|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|
|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|
|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|
|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|

Revenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. 

Debt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. 

Let's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\+362 Million|
|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\+9,138 Billion|
|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\+23,927 Billion|
|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\+35,882 Billion|
|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\-11,328 Billion|
|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\-13,603 Billion|

Net cash flow is very strong and growing \~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.

Now, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. 

Lastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.

So, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)

Anyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. 

# Direct TV:

AT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. 

Selling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. 

# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: 

These acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. 

In addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. 

There is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. 

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

The AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$29.54|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|19.44|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|
|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|

The payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  

However, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. 

Note though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. 

# Closing Thoughts:

This stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. 

If you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. 

A quick disclosure, I do own AT&T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

I see the slack acquisition as a positive for the long term since their current communication means is pretty shite. And I, like most people who use it, personally like the slack platform as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are the best ETFs to buy and holds for ~2 years? Hi,

I am a newbie in stocks, and I've only learned most of the basics so far. I want to invest my money in some ETFs, as I've learned that they are good for long term investment, but I am still not sure which ones to buy, and if it's better to put all my money into one ETF or share it across several ones. 

I learned that S$P 500 ones are trustworthy and usually have good returns and etc, but wanted to ask you guys if you suggest any other ETF. 

Besides, I want to invest something like $20K, and I don't know if I should put all of that into stocks at first, or if I should invest some of that money first and see how it goes and then add more money.

I would appreciate any helps from you guys, as this post might be the question of many other stock newbies like me.

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Compound interest...over a hundred years?! I know anti-aging research is still a nascent industry, but with how technology is accelerating, I can't help my fantasize living for hundreds of years!


SO I was playing with a compound interest calculator...and if you invest 1 dollar with the average S&P rate of return (10%)...after 100 years, that dollar would be worth $13780!


Anyone else play with this type of math? We would each be able to own our own planet!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla's competitors in the EV industry (Non-Chinese) There is a very nice saying that I read some time ago: "if you can't ride two horses at once you shouldn't be in the circus". 

Hence, I am looking to invest in companies (non-Chinese) on long-haul on some names which could possibly in the near future become Tesla's nightmares. 

Any suggestions? :)
