 Advice on gaming stock picks? Do you guys think it's a good time to buy in on TTWO and ATVI? I recently bought in with Nintendo and Capcom for the long term on Friday (only 5 shares each cuz I'm poor but had extra funds from my transfer from M1 to Fidelity lol). 

I wanted to monitor my watch list in order to wait and see if there will be any dips before buying in within the next couple of weeks or so, but do you think I'll be short changing myself if I continue to wait?

I'm also waiting with Microsoft, Sony, Tencent and Sea, but what do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What news sources have been the most honest, insightful, and helpful sources for stocks?

&nbsp;

I spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding GME and its future. I am by no means a financial expert and I guess I am obligated to say this isn’t financial advice. I am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and I hate to see people get taken advantage of. I don’t know that I am 100% right, but hopefully my post helps at least one person. 
&nbsp;

**1. Was there already a squeeze?**

By definition, yes, there was a squeeze. According to the S3 Partners estimates (graph linked below), the short interest on GME fell from approximately 69 million shares on 1/13/21 to 26.39 million shares on 2/3/21. This means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions. 
&nbsp;

**2. What if the short interest data is wrong/intentionally falsified?**

More short interest data will come out on 2/9/21, but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of January. If you think S3 Partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isn’t anything that I am going to say that will change your mind.
&nbsp;

**3. Could there be another squeeze?**

There is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero.
&nbsp;

**4. What would it take to cause another squeeze?**

Since the short interest is significantly lower, it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions. Based on the short interest chart below, it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2/1/21. In order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy, GME bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares. (This was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 1/25/21 through 1/29/21 by an average daily price and adding them together. I chose 1/25/21 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now). Since the current short interest is significantly lower, it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions. 
&nbsp;

**Common Misconceptions:**
&nbsp;

**1. I lost 70+% on my GME shares. I might as well hold since it’s basically worthless.**

This is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources. There are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have. There is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments.
&nbsp;

**2. I should hold for the long play since I am down.**

Unless you purchased GME for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals, this is probably not a great idea. GME is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started (~$5 per share) and even with the new executive leadership, it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term.
&nbsp;

**3. Everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and I don’t want to disappoint them.**

People who are still holding GME and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions, there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money. People telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling. It is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up. It is important to think for yourself and not just hold/buy/sell because someone tells you to. Do your own research and make your own decision. This is not a family or a team, this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves.
&nbsp;

**4. I only lose if I sell.**

You lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell. The idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true.
&nbsp;

**5. I should average down by buying more shares at a lower price.**

Buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares, but it increases your exposure. If the stock continues to fall, you will lose more money.
&nbsp;

**6. We did it before; we can do it again.**

The short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying. We saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze. I agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early, however, that does not mean that it can be done again. There is no longer much media attention on GME and the attention that it is getting is not always positive.
&nbsp;

**7. What about stimulus checks, won’t that cause another squeeze?**

I would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into GME stock. The media attention isn’t there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over.
&nbsp;

**8. All the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up.**

Everyone has a price that they will paper hands at. Some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still. Some people just bought in for the first time. The paper hands traders are definitely not gone.
&nbsp;

**9. By holding, I am sticking it to the man.**

While it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you, it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares. You are not causing them extreme pain by holding. There are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to.
&nbsp;

**10. We are at (insert place) in the VW short squeeze graph.**

This information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come. The VW squeeze was very different to the GME squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading.
&nbsp;

**11. Anyone posting negatively about GME is a bot from the government or the suits.**

I’m not saying there are no bots, but this is not a real argument. A lot of people who haven’t posted on WSB before were just lurkers. The amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out.

For transparency, I believe that we have already seen the top of the GME squeeze and it will return to its old price so I have multiple GME put options.

This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

I\`m genuinely interested in learning about the topic and trying to understand a little bit more about the stock market.*

Hi,

With everything going on around the GME / RH and retail investors it seems that almost all brokerage firms have an agreement with Citadel Clearing (RH, fidelity, tdameritrade and C. Swab etc...) for order placing. Report that shows that below for each firm.

[https://content.schwab.com/drupal\_dependencies/psr/606/2020-Q4-Schwab-Quarterly-Report.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/drupal_dependencies/psr/606/2020-Q4-Schwab-Quarterly-Report.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)

*I could be interpreting these reports incorrectly to formulate my question below.*

If Citadel pays brokerages for the order processing flow rights and these (Fidelity, TD etc...) companies also have their own Clearing according to this article, is Citadel executing only a few orders or specific transactions?

[https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/)

When I place a stock / options order, how do I know whose processing that, is the brokerage or the affiliate Citadel?

If Citadel Securities receives all **or** partial orders, is it fair assuming they know which ones are institutions and which ones are retail investors? and by knowing all of that and the fact that Ken Griffin CEO of Citadel Hedge based in Chicago, would it be possible that this company could have leaked information from brokerages so that they can "predict" the market?

It is overwhelming reading all of these articles online and I was hopping to get some additional ideas from fellow reddit stock users. Let me know if there is anything I misunderstood on the reports or anything on this post.

So I want to ask if I am missing something here:

When scrolling through some pages I saw this "investment pyramid" they recommend which basically says : 

ETFs : 25% (Vanguard All World)

Solid Stocks: 40% (sth. like Unilever, Pepsi, etc)

Diversification to the portfolio: 18% (sth. like Berkshire, Tencent)

Market leaders: 12% (Amazon for example)

"Rockets"/Growers: 5% (Nvidia, Samsung SDI)

&#x200B;

While I understand you want to diversify in terms of locations, markets, etc. when you build your own portfolio, I do not understand why you would put ETFs in there. I mean an ETF like above is always diversified. What is the reasoning behind so many individual stocks in addition that are anyhow represented in the ETF?

My portfolio is mostly 2 ETFs (World and EM) with some selected stocks I do research on and in which I believe (I expect them to grow). So I would say I only invest in indivdual stocks for the "fun" and hoping to get one or two 10/50/100 baggers.

My point in posting this is that I have seen a lot of people over the last month or so mentioning how ARK is the future and how they are placing their "low risk" money in these funds to safely grow.  

While I am still very bullish for now, I also think it's important to point out that these are definitely not low risk investments (insofar as overall market volatility).  When we do see a market correction, whether that be in 1 week or 10 years, your ark investments are almost certainly going to get hit a lot harder than money in lower risk ETFs or funds (i.e. spy, qqq, etc).

**Overview**

10 year old biotech company working on mRNA (messenger RNA) gene therapeutics.

Main product is an inhaled mRNA treatment for cystic fibrosis which is currently in Phase 1 / 2 trials. Basically, medicine that helps cells with defective genes make proteins that restore normal function.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal hereditary disease in the US and caused by a defective gene. mRNA therapeutics have the potential to be more effective than other gene therapy methods.

Also partnering with Sanofi Pasteur on a novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

mRNA therapeutics have an advantage over gene editing therapies like CRISPR because they don’t need to edit the genome to restore normal function.

**Company Capitalization**

2B market cap, upcoming earnings on 3/11

NASDAQ

**Revenue, Profit, and Margin Trends**

Q3 2020 was first profitable quarter.

P/S: 171

P/E: - no reported earnings

Assets at 900M

Q3 2020 

Revenue: 66.45M up over 5000%

Income: 17.34M up 180%+

Lots of cash on hand

**Competitors and Industries**

While there are plenty of gene therapy operations, there is little to no competition in gene therapies using mRNA. Plenty of competition if you consider other gene therapy companies. Closest competitor found was Editas Medical which has similar financials but closer to a Crispr Therapeutics AG competitor.

Biotech is a notoriously volatile industry which prices based on clinical drug trials being passed before real earnings.

**Valuation Multiples**

Definitely a growth stock

P/E: low at 0.23 but up 150%+ which would make it undervalued.

**Management and Ownership**

Leadership and Board of Directors all have lots of industry experience.

CFO departed in Dec 2020.

**Balance Sheet Exam**

Lots of cash, negative debit (how does that work?), but Q3 2020 was their first profitable quarter.

**Stock Price History**

Stock price has been spiky with mid-long periods of flatness but the last year has seen a pretty smooth upward trend.

**Stock Options and Dilutions**

Just issued a total of 57,550 shares at $24.43 to 4 new employees on Feb 3rd.

**Expectations**

Strong short, medium, and long-term growth. Stock price has been going steadily upward since early Dec 2020 and they are announcing interim results of their clinical trial for cystic fibrosis in Q2 of 2021.

Excellent Glassdoor reviews.

**Risks**

It’s biotech and dependent on the fruition of drug trials which can be lengthy and either boom or bust for a lot of companies although they seem to have the necessary experience and plenty of cash on hand.

\- Lets say my total savings including investments + emergency fund are 30k right now. How much money I should have aside before buying a house with a 50k deposit? Not sure if people have a rule about this, but utilising all my savings for a deposit doesn't sound like a good idea.

\- Should I completely change the way I research assuming that in the next 2 years I might have to withdraw a big part and start over? 

Thank you for your time_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good Time to Invest Into Unity? Looking into companies to invest, I noticed that Unity took a big drop on Friday? Do you guys think it’s a good time to invest into the company? Do you think this would be a short term or long term investment?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC Buying and Selling Strategy: Always Plan Out Your Trades To Minimize Risk Not a financial advisor. I'm just sharing a fun idea.

On Monday, my funds will have settled for me to work on a dollar cost averaging strategy as described below:

* 25 shares - buy limit 1% below market
* 25 shares - 2% below market
* 50 shares - 3% below market
* 100 shares - 5% below market
* 200 shares - 8% below market
* 400 shares - 13% below market

(\~$5,500)

I will hedge The above plays with put contracts with a March 19th expiration:

5 x $6 put (\~$1,100 or 20% of my long position) 

The idea is that IF AMC continues to move downwards, I will have some downside protection and profit off the puts. Based on option greek values and price spreads, if AMC moves 13%, the puts should be ITM at \~$70 profit per contract (or $350 unrealized profit). At 13% down, the 800 filled shares will have a cost basis would be down \~$194  (Math below). The net profit: +350 - 194 = $156

* 25 shares - sell limit 1% below market (-12%) = -20
* 25 shares - 2% below market (-11%)  = -18
* 50 shares - 3% below market (-10%) = -34
* 100 shares - 5% below market (-8%) = -54
* 200 shares - 8% below market (-5%) = -68
* 400 shares - 13% below market (-0%) = -0
* Net Share Loss = -$194

Should AMC continue to dive below the -13% mark, I will continue the next share layer at 800 shares at 21% down and open 5 x $5 puts. The cycle continues. 

This play is betting on an inflection point to show up. I set an arbitrary percentage gain as an indicator of an inflection point (+3-4%), at which point, I will sell the put contracts, and begin unwinding the share positions by setting sell limits at 1,2,3,5,8,13% above market value, only this time, the share volume that I will sell will be 50% of everything above. This leaves me with 50% of my position if AMC recovers and I can ride out the rest to Valhalla with much less capital. I would not add call options following an inflection point to reduce capital risk. 800 shares to ride out is plenty enough!

In the worst light, this may better explain to a mildly satisfying degree why $AMC and $GME have shown similar trends (and for me personally explains the final behavior of $GME at the end of Friday)

CN has seen slow, steady growth for years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.575 CAD per common share. Speaking of CAD, CN might look like a good option for American investors given the $CAD/$USD disparity.

*****
> Stocks head into the week ahead with a tailwind, as investors focus on a hefty fiscal stimulus package and the solid earnings season against a backdrop of rising interest rates.
*****
> There are several dozen S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Cisco and The Walt Disney Co. On the data front, there are just a few reports in the coming week, but the consumer price index inflation report is the important one to watch when it is released Wednesday.
*****
> Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell speaks mid-week at a webinar hosted by the Economics Club of New York.
*****
> Stocks surged in the past week, with the S&P 500 jumping 4.65% to a new record high, in its best week since November. The S&P 500 closed Friday at 3,886.
*****
> The hyper-activity around short-squeeze names, like GameStop, receded in the past week. Market chatter turned to rising interest rates, the steepening yield curve and market expectations for inflation.
*****
> “Rates are actually going up as really an expression of the potential that economic activity is likely to start accelerating, and we’ll likely see some inflation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> Hogan said investors will stay most focused on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which Democrats are pushing forward. If it is signed into law at its current size, the total federal spending due to the pandemic would be $5.3 trillion, according to Cowen, an investment bank.
*****
> “I think the path of least resistance has resumed to a higher level. I think we had a mini correction a week ago and I think it happened pretty quickly,” said Hogan of National Securities.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher and the only bumps in the road that I can see are a delay in fiscal stimulus or some exogenous factor come in and changes the dynamics,” he added.
*****
> The market is also depending on continued improvement in new virus cases, said Hogan.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The prospect of more spending and an improving economy drove Treasury yields higher in the past week.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% late Friday, after edging to 1.18% earlier in the day, near its recent high of 1.19%.
*****
> The 10-year is the most closely watched, as it influences the rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans. Yields rise as the price of bonds decline.
*****
> Market pros have also been watching another bond market metric: the yield curve.
*****
> It is the spread between the yield on a short-term Treasury, like the 2-year note, and a longer duration Treasury, like the 10-year. In that case, the spread widened to reach 1.06% over the course of the week.
*****
> That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2017. A steeper curve — which is what we’re seeing today — is viewed as a sign of an improving economy.
*****
> Strategists say the move higher in Treasury yields so far is not detrimental to stocks, but instead is a reflection of the economic bounce that could come from the stimulus package.
*****
> Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the steepening curve is good for the stock market, creating a tailwind for his “epicenter” trade in stocks that will benefit from an improving post-Covid economy.
*****
> His preferred sectors are the cyclicals — including industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, energy and financials.
*****
> Lee said the selling by hedge funds after short squeezes in a number of stocks and the record decline in the VIX, the volatility index, has led him to change his view on the stock market. He previously expected a sell-off in the first half of the year.
*****
> Now, Lee sees a “high probability that the first half 2021 correction is over.” The VIX, which is based on puts and calls in the S&P 500, started the week over 33 and fell to 20.87 when the market closed on Friday. A low VIX signals lowered expectations for market volatility.
*****
> The sectors that did well in the past week were mostly the ones that will do better in a financial rebound, or in a higher rate environment. Financials were 6.6% higher in the past week as big banks rose along with the yield curve. Higher long-term interest rates are a positive for bank profits.
*****
> The industrial group rose 4.9%, and materials were up 3.9%. Energy, lifted by a jump in oil prices, gained 8.3%. Tech recovered some ground, gaining 4.9%.
*****
> Sectors that do not do particularly well with rising rates, were up less, including utilities, up 2.3%, and real estate investment trusts, up 3%.
*****
> “It’s really about having an economic boom, allowing policy to support that boom,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “That’s the key driver of why the curve is steepening.”
*****
> Some strategists say the curve is also steepening because of the U.S. will be issuing a lot of debt to pay for the trillions in fiscal stimulus, and that would cause interest rates to rise.
*****
> That has also triggered concerns about increasing inflation. While economists do not expect inflation to spike, they do see the potential, for the first time in years, for inflation to move meaningfully above 2%.
*****
> Markets will also be monitoring the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which begins Feb. 9.
*****
> “It will get a lot of attention. Do the markets care? Maybe not, but everyone will be paying attention,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

> # Super Bowl LV: Time to Break the Tie - Go Bucs!

> This year's Super Bowl will be a first for many different reasons. It will be the first-ever game played in the home stadium of one of the teams playing. It will be the first-ever game with a 43 year old starting QB. The age difference between the starting QBs will be the widest ever (18+ years). The game will not be played to a full stadium (atendance capped at 25K). We could go on. Another interesting aspect of this year's game is that it will break the tie between the AFC and NFC for number of championships won (27). The last time the two conferences had an equal number of Super Bowl titles was back in 1990 after Super Bowl XXIV when each conference had 12. The New York Giants broke that tie in 1991 when Scott Norwood went 'wide ride' to give the NFC its 7th straight and 13th total Super Bowl victory. From there, the NFC continued its domination of the AFC (and the Bills) winning the next six championship games, including three against the Bills.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/020521-Super-Bowl.png))**

> We've all heard of the Super Bowl market indicator which says that a win for the NFC bodes well for the equity market while an AFC victory is a bearish signal. For years, there actually was a wide gap in performance for the market following wins by either conference in the past, but in recent years the disparity has narrowed. In the 27 years where the AFC has won the Super Bowl, the S&P 500 averaged a rest of year gain of 6.9% with positive returns 70% of the time. When the NFC wins, though, the S&P 500's average rest of year performance has been a gain of 10.5% with positive returns more than 77% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/020521-Super-Bowl-Wins-NFC-AFC.png))**

> When it comes to individual teams, 13 have won the Super Bowl more than once. The two teams with the most victories are the Steelers and Patriots each of which has won the game six times. The Dallas Cowboys otfen refer to themselves as 'America's Team' but Pittsburgh is the "Stock Market's Team". In the six years where the Steelers won the Super Bowl, the S&P 500 experienced positive returns for the remainder of the year every time for an average gain of 18.8%! Market returns for the Patriots following their six victories has been a much more muted 4.6%, including a decline more than 21% from the end of the team's first victory in 2002. The 49ers and the Broncos have 'only' won five and three Super Bowls, respectively, but following their victories, the S&P 500 has been up for the remainder of the year every time for an average gain of more then 20%!

> So, what about this year's teams? The Chiefs have won the Super Bowl twice in their history, and the S&P 500 has averaged a rest of year gain of 8.1% following their victories. While the S&P 500 was down for the remainder of the year after they won in 1970, the decline was less than 1%. The one year the Chiefs made it to the championship but lost, the S&P 500 was up over 14% for the remainder of the year.

> For the NFC, Tampa Bay's one and only appearance in the Super Bowl was in 2003 (XXXVII). They won that game, and the S&P 500's rest of year gain was over 29%. Additionally, while they're on a new team now, in the three Patriots vicotries where Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski were both on the team, the S&P 500 was higher for the remainder of the year all three times for an average gain of 12.7%. Go Bucs!

> # Should Investors Root For Tom Brady Or Patrick Mahomes?

> The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 54 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn’t always work, as stocks did quite well the past two years even though AFC teams won.

> It was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

> A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl Indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 7.1% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&P 500 has been up only 65% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s the catch. Stocks have actually done just fine lately when the AFC has won. In fact, the S&P 500 Index gained 10 of the past 11 years after an AFC Super Bowl champ.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “There have been 54 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And wouldn’t you know it, the best stock market performance happens after the Bucs win the big game? But I don’t care, I’m still not rooting for Tom Brady.”

> Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&P 500 has done following their victories. For some reason, the author’s favorite team, The Cincinnati Bengals, isn’t on this list. We double checked the data, but they still aren’t on there.

> Lastly, this is Tom Brady’s record 10th Super Bowl. It turns out; stocks don’t do well when he is in the game, up only 0.5% for the year. Meanwhile, should he lose (again, what the author is hoping for here), stocks actually do quite poorly, down 10.4% on average.

> # Post-Election Februarys Have Been Even More Troublesome

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a3e19a00cddddb7704cdd8a753391f6e/21a0af750a31c87e-f0/s500x750/12edd49a31c1cf7460cb21815b25d793853b7db8.jpg))**

> From yesterday’s post, we knew February has a tepid recent record. In post-election years, February’s historically record has been even worse as historical average losses swell. In order to include as much data as we have available, we are using DJIA data since 1901, S&P 500 since 1930, NASDAQ from 1971 and Russell 1000& 2000 data beginning in 1979. When comparing post-election year February to the recent 21-year February seasonal pattern, the overall shape and trend does not change greatly however, weakness becomes more prevalent as the mid-month surge is less pronounced and second half declines expand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3c9c5cb8cb9d933fd2d96b686791066c/21a0af750a31c87e-1e/s500x750/26d3402fd26a76aa62cc8617497bd3095256cb33.jpg))**

> Breaking down historical performance by year confirms frequent post-election-year February losses, most notably by NASDAQ and DJIA. Generally speaking, when February is positive it is an “ok” month, but when the month has been down, it has frequently been down by sizable amounts. There are seven double-digit losses in the table and not a single double-digit gain.

*****

> # Typical February Trading: Lackluster Over Last 21 Years

> February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly –0.04%. Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.6% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like yesterday, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities over the last 21 years. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been somewhat disappointing for bulls.

> # As Goes January, So Goes The Year

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?

> There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.7% on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.1.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “A weak January could foretell of rough times ahead in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is lately the trend has been broken, as stocks have done quite well after a weak January.” In fact, 8 of the past 9 times January saw stocks lower the final 11 months finished higher.

> # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?

> Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to “lose less” rather than “earn slightly more” than the value of the loan extended.

> The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the U.S.

> However, negative yielding debt does affect U.S. investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn 0.37% after hedging costs, compared with the -0.45% current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for U.S. debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and dampen the outlook for fixed income investors.

> What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of 1.25–1.75%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ r/Stocks Discuss Overlooked Stocks Saturday - Feb 06, 2021 Wall Street is going for lunch right now, so now's the time to discuss overlooked stocks that no one is talking about:  Overlooked & possibly undervalued stocks.

Here are 5 tickers to take advantage of this SKLZ. Not so much sports betting, but arguably E-Sports. SKLZ is a platform where developers make games, and gamers can compete against each other and win money. ARKK has been adding it to its ETFs like crazy. And for good reason

PENN. PENN has been absolutely flying, due to the fact that it has a 36% stake in barstool sports. PENN is uniquely positioned thanks to its enormous audience to take advantage of this emerging market, and is definitely worth some consideration

DKNG. The poster child of sports betting. DKNG has exclusive deals with ESPN, making it uniquely positioned to capitalize strongly in this market. That combined with their amazing marketing make DKNG a definite buy

FUBO. FUBO is a content streaming platform trying to expand its bases into sports betting. They’re uniquely positioned, because they want to make their sports betting platform interactive with their steaming platform. That being said, you don’t need to own a FUBO to use their app, giving them another revenue stream. That combined with their insanely low market cap compared their competitors makes this stock the best individual (in our opinion) for sports betting

BETZ. FUBO might be (debatably) the best individual stock for sports betting, but BETZ is the best asset if you want to take advantage of this emerging market without too much effort. It’s an ETF, so you just buy and forget. Its top holdings including PENN and DKNG, so it’s a definite buy if you don’t want to have to worry about the performance of a specific stock

So my birthday this year was an interesting one.  I managed to get an RTX 3070 for 10% off with my birthday offer at Best Buy, and I also had (about a week prior) bought $800 worth of shares in a company called Gores Holdings because I’d heard about a merger taking place with [UWM] and read nothing but good things about them.  Apparently they’re one of the best, most responsive mortgage lenders out there, and better than Rocket Mortgage by a long-shot.  Well, I bought in at $12.50 per share, and have seen nothing but a drop in value since merging with a company which was trading at $100 per share at the time, while the parent company continues to climb in value.

&nbsp;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What’s all the fuss about BEAM? Some of you may have noticed that there’s a new player in the CRISPR gene editing field, Beam Therapeutics, which IPOed last year and has rocketed from ~$20 a share to currently about ~$120 a share. Suddenly Cathie Wood of ARK is adding it to her ARKK and ARKG funds

Meanwhile they make no money and have no real “product”. So is this a big bubble? What’s going on?

My belief is that BEAM has the longest runway for the development of new therapeutics based on CRISPR technology because they have the BEST technology.

The CRISPR technology that EDIT, CRSP, and NTLA use is essentially first generation CRISPR which cannot be targeted everywhere in the genome and has off-target effects.

BEAM is the brainchild of David Liu, a Harvard scientist who utilizes forward evolution to engineer next-generation CRISPR. BEAM is specifically licensed to use Dr. Liu’s CRISPR technology, specifically his “base editors” and “prime editors.” Making a long story short, BEAM has the technology to edit anywhere in the genome with less off-target effects than the tech of NTLA, EDIT, and CRSP. Also, as you may know, EDIT, NTLA, and CRSP have had longstanding patent battles over their technology. BEAM has no such issue.

So what’s BEAM’s plan?

 1. They can correct the ACTUAL sickle cell mutation that is present in patients. CRSP and the others are using their technology to turn on fetal hemoglobin production to bypass the mutation.

 2. In a collaboration with Verve, they showed they could correct the PCSK9 mutation in primates and PERMANENTLY lower blood cholesterol for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

 3. They also show data correcting the actual patient mutations in several liver diseases.

4. David Liu just had a paper in Nature showing they could correct the mutation that causes progeria, which is the disease where you rapidly age. 

Is the stock a bubble that may collapse? I hope so. I’ll buy the dip.

David Liu also has an agriculture company called Pairwise Plants in which they want to use the technology to gene edit crops, etc. If it goes public, I’ll be all over it.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biggest U.S. Pension Bought More NIO and Activision Stock, and 2 Retailers America’s largest public pension by assets under management recently made major changes to its investment portfolio.

The California Public Employees Retirement System bought more NIO ￼ (ticker: NIO) and Activision ￼ Blizzard (ATVI) shares, and raised its investments in retailers Walmart ￼ (WMT) and Target ￼ (TGT) in the fourth quarter. Calpers, as the pension fund is known, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Calpers, which has total assets of $445.6 billion, declined to comment on the stock trades.

The pension bought 284,842 more American depositary receipts of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, ending 2020 with 2.6 million ADRs. Calpers had been buying up NIO in the third quarter, as well.

NIO ADRs rocketed more than 12 times in value last year, and so far in 2021 through Friday’s close, they were up 16.3%. In comparison, the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market, rose 16.3% in 2020, and has gained 3.5% so far this year.

NIO’s deliveries were strong in January, a bullish sign for investors, who seem to have an insatiable appetite for EV stocks. Nonetheless, NIO moved in January to raise capital through bonds.

Calpers bought 1.8 million Activision shares in the fourth quarter, lifting its investment to 6.2 million shares of the videogame maker.

Activision stock surged 56.3% in 2020 as the homebound stepped up their indoor gaming. So far this year, shares have gained 9.4%.

Earnings last week topped expectations, sending Activision stock zooming. Activision said in December that its latest version of World of Warcraft is the fastest-selling PC game of all time. That announcement was on the heels of another upbeat assessment of the sales of another game.

Walmart stock surged 21.3% in 2020, but so far this year it is nearly flat with a gain of 0.1%.

At least one analyst thinks Walmart stock is due for another double-digit rise in 2021. The retail giant is continuing a digital push, even as its e-commerce chief retired at the end of January.

Calpers bought 824,835 more Walmart shares in the fourth quarter, raising its holdings to 7.3 million shares.

The pension bought 436,897 additional Target shares to raise its investment to 1.9 million shares.

Target stock outdid Walmart’s in 2020, soaring 37.7%, and it has gained 7.0% so far this year.

Target stock slipped in January after investors were disappointed that holiday sales weren’t stronger. The shares still have fans on Wall Street A Barron’s stock pick in the late summer, Target did quite well through the end of 2020.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Ammo Munitions Inc (POWW) POWW is set to report earnings on February 16, before market open. I believe that POWW could easily surpass $10 (current price of $7.19), any disagreements are welcome.

On February 4th, POWW announced a "256% year-over-year increase in orders shipped" in fiscal Q3 2021." Management added that "booked orders ... have now increased to a record setting $180 million as of February 1, 2021." And CEO Fred Wagenhals said Ammo is continuing to "strategically and effectively increase our order intake, manufacturing and shipping capacity in an effort to address the continuing escalating demand being received across all channels, as our record backlog continues to grow."

It's well known that guns and ammunition have been in high demand since the beginning of the pandemic, a cursory search will show that gun stores have been consistently running out of ammo for almost a year.  On Jan. 6, the company predicted fiscal Q3 2021 sales will grow nearly 500% to $16.5 million. Six days later, on Jan. 12, the company issued a forecast for fiscal *Q4* of 317% year-over-year sales growth. I believe this demand has only increased, without getting into politics, due to the political instability in the US.

On January 5th, POWW announced that it is constructing a new plant to triple their manufacturing capability. On Feb 2nd, POWW announced that it restarted its improved .50 caliber manufacturing line to address increased market demand and fulfill current orders. I believe this to be exceptional news, given the political instability world wide, that military orders could be forthcoming.

While POWW has almost doubled this year based on the above mentioned news, I believe that it still has legs and earnings could be a catalyst for another 50% growth in stock price. I also don't believe the recent increase in price is detrimental, given how the marked has reacted to momentum as of late.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Edit:

10 x $7.50c Feb 19, considering buying 100 shares before earnings depending on profit taking Monday morning._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which semi company? I’m triming my positions. I have three chip companies and I’m trying to get down to two maybe even one. So which one? I have TSM, QCOM, and NVDA. 

I think the keeper is TSM being that they have had better leadership/past success, they are currently focusing on the auto shortage, they are essentially a manufacturer for others designs and are the go to for big players when they need chips made. So whatever the future holds for chips this is who you go to to have them made. Financials are good with growth across all stages in double digits. 

QCOM is different and tries to make their own designs and sell that. They benefit from the 5G rollout and thats main reason I have them but is that done? Their past isn’t amazing but they jumped a ton in revenue the past two qrt which is expected based on 5G sales. So holding them is really based on the 5G future and I’m not aware of their involvement in the auto, ai, and gaming spaces.

NVDA is just a behemoth of growth outperforming the other two on their financials. They had a bad 2020 but thats one year and debts getting up there but still ok. They have their hands in many areas mostly ai and gaming. Not a question of their future success but rather their valuation. Its gotten about twice as expensive as its historical values so maybe time to dump until later. But this also is valued high because of stock price rising and them having a bad year which is not a big problem for me. 

So maybe someone on reddit can set me straight. Do I dump QCOM and NVDA? Keep one or the other for some reason? Dump TSM and NVDA because I completely missed something about QCOM?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short Interest Stocks What happened these past couple weeks is due to short squeezes. This peaked my interest.

With that being said, this is from Jan 15 (if only I’d been paying attention). Does anyone know of this info is updated Biweekly, monthly, or only when people care?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aren't you tired of people saying "just invest in the S&P 500"? I often hear people saying stuff like "just invest in the S&P 500 and forget about it. you're never going to beat it anyway" (especially in r/investing), and I find it quite sad sometimes. I know that most people are probably just saying it because they don't want anyone to lose money, and it's true that most people will be better off just by investing in the S&P 500. If my mother wanted to invest, I'd probably tell her the same thing, so I get it. But not anyone is like that, and I'd like to see more encouragement in trying stuff, instead of just saying "just put your money in the S&P 500 and don't even try".

I'm fairly new to investing, but I get great joy from investing and researching companies. Investing in the S&P 500 would be very boring for me. And I'm also doing very well so far. I don't have a long track record at the moment obviously, since I've been investing for only 2 years. So far, I've always beat the S&P 500 by a long margin . I know 2 years is not much, but hopefully I can continue doing great in the long run.

I also want to be clear about the fact that I don't do day trading or any of this stuff. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to beat the S&P 500 if I did that.

My tactic is very simple: I buy great stocks and I hold. I never panic sell. And when things go badly and maybe some stocks go down 20%, that's when I buy more, because I still believe in my companies. I've managed to cut out all of the emotions and it served me very well so far.

I know that many people don't beat the S&P 500 in the long run, but it's also true that the statistic is also full of people that do day trading or that simply panic sell every 6 months, right?

So I'm also curious to hear from people that have invested far longer than me; how's it going for you?

Also, one more thing: funnily enough, 99% of the people that say to simply invest in the S&P 500, are not even doing it themselves, and they're actually buying lots of individual stocks... and making lots of money. Isn't that ironic?

**EDIT:**

Many people brought up Warren and the fact that he said he has troubles outperforming the S&P 500.

I love Warren, but maybe we should stop thinking that if there's something he can't do, then he can't be done.

Also, there's one very important thing to consider: his situation is very different than the average person. Warren is not investing $500k per year, he's investing hundreds of billions. He has lots of responsibilities, and the psychological factors of having that much capital makes it a very different situation. I'm sure I'd do way worse than how I'm doing now if I was in his position.

You can hear himself saying it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDiMv3ZXbXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDiMv3ZXbXU)

In regards of people not beating the S&P 500 in the long term: we need to keep in mind that the statistic takes into consideration all the results of the past, but the world was completely different 20 years ago. Let alone 50 years ago or even more than that.

I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to beat the S&P 500 if I was a person investing in the stock market in 1960. Way too difficult back then, maybe I would've even lost all of my money very easily. Back then you had to buy a newspaper every day to read about the stocks available, and then go out and buy a physical stock. No easily accessible communities that you could join to learn and pick good stocks. Nothing like that.

But things are way different now, technology changed it all and now you can have the same insights of a person that does this as his/her main job. Plus, we now have entire communities of people sharing their knowledge and giving advice (like this one).

Chamath himself (and a few other people), lately said that the retail investor now has the same insights as a professional. And not only that, he also said that retail investors are now making better decisions than the average professional.

Which is why myself (and lots of other people) did very well in the last years. I know I can't definitely take all the credit for my results in the stock market, because I didn't do it all by myself. Yes, I enjoy investing and I spend lots of time researching the stock market, but my biggest asset is actually the community of people on the Internet. People way more knowledgeable in this that I ever will. And I took all of their advices, watched their analysis, and then made my decisions. And this is the only reason why I'm doing well.

What Warren did during his life is really, really impressive. Not only because of what he did, but because he did it without all the things we've now (even reading reports and scanning information can now be done with way more efficiency).

But I'm also sure that lots of people will outperform Warren in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can anybody help me out with Barkbox's merger? I've seen some posts here about the upcoming BARK merger in April and i'd like your opinions on this.

Burry about how maybe we live in a time where the iron coffin lid could finally come off. He recommended the stock Murakami Corp which is a company that produces rear-view mirrors and automobile cameras and stuff like that. Now the Thing is that this Company has more cash on hand (37bn¥) than their market cap (33,4bn¥) is. So as far as I can tell basically all net income is free for stock holders? And as the interest for the Japanese economy is gonna rise (coffinlid comming off) the potential gains must be huge. Can anybody tell me if im correct or just being stupid and missing something?

The technology is an under display camera which shoots through a transparent OLED. This eliminates any bezel/notches which is currently the only viable option for a true full screen display.

A company called visionox was first to produce the technology and was rumoured to be featured in the S21. The leaks eventually showed that Samsung sacked their technology off but now in 2021 they are producing it themselves. First released in their laptops and rumoured the Fold 3/Note series.

It's looking very promising at this point where visionox continously looked dead in the water. Is there anybody who is following this news/technology? My question is a noob investor is would this technology even make a dent on their current stock price? I know Samsung are producing the iPhone 12 display so it is very likely once is rolled out the iPhone 14 will purchase the tech from Samsung.

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What data do you use in your valuation models? Hey guys, first post here!

So, I've finally started building a very simplistic valuation model which looks at EPS, growth of earnings, rate of return, etc.

However, the issue that I am having is that EPS for specific companies seems to differ across every single data provider!

For example, I was looking at Baidu (I'm using BIDU as an example, but I've seen several other companies in the same situation). Yahoo gives it a TTM EPS of $**12.83** ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BIDU?p=BIDU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BIDU?p=BIDU)). NASDAQ has a TTM EPS of **$7.76** ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bidu/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bidu/earnings)). Google Finance gives me an EPS of **$10.08** ([https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BIDU:NASDAQ](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BIDU:NASDAQ) \- dividing the price by the PE ratio to get the EPS). Now, using the Google Sheets' GOOGLEFINANCE function gives me an EPS of **$10.54**. MSN Money gives me an EPS of **$10.54**, too ([https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/nas-bidu/fi-a1ohm7](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/nas-bidu/fi-a1ohm7)). Bloomberg gives me the EPS value of 52.94 (I assume it's in RMB), but if I convert it to USD using today's rate (flawed, I know), I get $8.19 ([https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BIDU:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BIDU:US)). Finally, according to BIDU itself, the EPS data is, according to their financial statements:

* Q3'20: $5.86 (GAAP), $3.00 (non-GAAP)
* Q2'20: $1.46 (GAAP), $2.08 (non-GAAP)
* Q1'20: $0.00 (GAAP), $1.25 (non-GAAP)
* Q4'20: $2.62 (GAAP), $3.81 (non-GAAP)

When you sum it up, the GAAP TTM EPS is **$9.94**, whereas the non-GAAP is **$10.84**. So far, I've got 7 different figures for the EPS and they differ by a lot! My question is - why the hell do all these providers give me different data? My only explanation is that some are using GAAP earnings whereas the others are using non-GAAP earnings, but even then... we're all looking at the same reports, right? I assume we cannot consider audited vs unaudited financial statements as we're talking about the TTM EPS - as far as I'm aware, the only audited statements are the 10K yearly reports, right? I know currency may play a role in BIDU's case as they report it in RMB (though they also report it in USD), but I've seen this happen with American businesses, too. Can someone shed light on this for me, as I find it super confusing?

Also, does anyone know what data do institutional traders use? My assumption is that they use Bloomberg Terminal so Bloomberg will have the most "accurate" data in that case (in terms of being relevant to the prevailing market evaluation).

The other question I have: are GAAP earnings data more relevant than non-GAAP earnings? I know that GAAP is meant to provide a standardised way of reporting accounting data, but some businesses simply work differently. I've already seen plenty, where according to GAAP, they're losing money, but according to non-GAAP, they are making. I've also seen the reverse multiple times. Is it a rule of thumb to use GAAP earnings data or does it vary on a case-by-case basis?

Right now I have 320k.

I saw some people talking about SPY and QQQ on this sub yesterday and I looked them up. 

So if I had put 150k into SPY and another 150K into QQQ I would have made over 15k in gains from the previous month. That's more than what I make at my day job. 

With the remaining 20k I wanna put 10k into my savings and use 10k to learn how to trade stocks like you guys do. I don't know anything about investing lol. 

So my question is, is it really that simple? I feel like I'm missing something and it can't be that simple. So set aside say 50% of the gains for taxes? 

Look I make 60k a year at my current job that I absolutely hate and it's killing my body. Can this be my chance to go back to school and live off of the monthly gains? I have very minimal bills. My house and car are paid off. 80% of my check post taxes goes into savings. I live a very boring life.

i have a very basic understand of the stock market. and only play around with stocks and options. nothing of the fancier derivatives. he first calls credit suisse, "wanting to unload my credit default swaps" what he holds are 20 EE tranches of ABS CDOs.

the banker and he both agree they are "bad" and "complete shit"

but the face value is 205MM. the first negotiations is the bank offers 40MM, ben says minimum is 100MM.

so i guess my questions are

1. what exactly are these securities? they are not options right?

2. if they are complete shit, why do they have such a high value in price? or were they simply jesting?

3. if the face value is 205MM, why would ben be fine to let it go for half that value?

4. WHY do the banks have to buy it? (or interested in buying it in the first place?). obviously these have demand, hence they have face value. but why do anyone have to buy them anyways?

I’m having trouble finding any info on google._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Give me your opinions on this strategy I've been thinking about 
So my strategy is based on the rocket stocks book written by Matthew kratter. You start by looking for stocks that are hitting New 52 week highs I usually do this on barchart because it will also tell you the volume for that day. After you've found a stock that's had a new 52 week high.  Check to make sure it's gapping up in volume. After both those two are checked look to make sure that the current price is above the 50-day moving average and the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average. It's not required but it is helpful if the cap is under five billion. It also helps if the float is low. 

Risk management: I would only put 10% of my portfolio into one stock. I would also have a stop loss at 10% of that stock so in total I would only be risking 1% of my portfolio. I would sell if I made 100% or higher profits, or if the price crossed below the 50-day moving average

As such, I am aware of the advantages of investing in ETFs and Index's and the lower risk which they inhabit, however, I am aware of the long term nature of these forms of investment and since the income which I plan on investing is disposable to me, in that it wont affect my living standards, I was wondering if it would be wiser to invest in these safer long term investments, or to take the risk and try to beat the market in stocks due to the fact that the cash is disposable to me. Would it even be worth trying to beat the stock market in that sense, or would just investing in Index's be a smarter idea?

Their take on the Pro, albeit very niche is an interesting direction for their top line and the Xperia 5 ii is in a nice direction for a consumer phone.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unique *I THINK* PDT Question (I did my diligence and searched online resources and was unable to find an answer) **TLDR:** PDT Rule from the SEC seems to say if your DT total is less that 6% of your total trades in a week you are not a day trader. Could you buy a ton of cheap shares, unload them the next day, then day trade to avoid PDT?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hey guys I have a quick question in reference to the PDT rule. Maybe it is the law student in me, maybe I am just being an idiot, but it struck me as interesting and after searching the internet, I couldn't find anything that spoke to it so I figured I would see if anyone had experience with this.

So, [FINRA defines the Pattern Day Trader Rule](https://www.sec.gov/files/daytrading.pdf) as:

>"Any customer who executes four or more 'day trades' within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer’s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period."

What that looks like to me when you break it down is...

1. Customer will be deemed a Pattern Day Trader if:
2. Customer executes four or more day trades
3. Within 5 business days
4. Using a margin account

**UNLESS**

5.  The number of trades represents less than 6% of the customer's total trades in the same period.

(The hyperlink is to the rule source)

If my interpretation is correct, would it not be possible to essentially game the system and buy, say 100 SUPER cheap stocks on Monday AH right before close, then wake up on Tuesday PM, sell them off and you would now have 5 day trades? Then you could theoretically rinse and repeat as needed.

I acknowledge that the very next sentence permits brokers the enact more narrow definitions, but I am strictly speaking from the standpoint of the SEC.

I am over the PDT threshold, so it is inapplicable to me, but I came across the rule while looking up something for a friend and it just kind of threw me. I do recognize the risk and I am certainly not advocating that anyone do this, but does anyone know if this technically could work?

To be ABUNDANTLY clear, I am *not asking for legal advice* and though I am approaching this from a letter of the law perspective, this post is *not intended to be taken as legal advice*. I am seeking an explanation from someone who is more familiar with these regulations strictly for educational purposes.

Their revenue is growing exponentially, but I do not think it is sustainable. Their financial projections (in the investor’s presentation linked below) are INSANE!  They have some great ideas, but are they executing on them well? They are beginning to do many things, but are they doing all of them well? IMO the valuation is insanely speculative and this is a gamble.

Like everything else that is ‘new’ and shiny, IPOE and Sofi have been gaining incredible traction on Reddit and beyond. I don’t think the company is as disruptive as they think they are, and I don’t think bring much to the table right now. I have seen some crazy numbers being thrown around – such as share price having a huge upside and being $200 within a year or two. Their core business model could face big challenges with debt cancellation, and their goal of being a one stop shop could be harder to realize than they think. 

**Student Loans:** Their original business model and still approx.. 50% of their revenue. Student loans were paused thanks to the CARES act and now with the potential for cancellation / forgiveness looming overhead, how many people will be refinancing any time soon? Anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 of debt could be erased. Not to mention, if debt is cancelled and those who refi'd with Sofi are stuck - they will not be happy campers.

**Personal Loans and Mortgages:** Mortgage rates are only going to go up from here and I’ll be honest, as a 29 year old I know very few people buying a home any time soon. Younger people are facing significant financial hardships. Personal loans have a minimum of $5000 and I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing tbh. There are many reports of people being denied loans despite having excellent credit. Customers have also posted tons of negative experiences they had during the loan process (link below).

**Banking:** Very standard and non-competitive rates. I do have an Ally savings account as they are tried and true – but definitely prefer brick and mortar for banking needs. 

**Investing:** They are fairly new to this part of their business and I don’t see how they stand out from competitors. There are several things they don’t offer atm that everyone else does (but probably will soon): options, after hours trading, stop losses, margin, etc. For many these things are critical to trading. I think people overestimate how many users are actually willing to jump ship from their current broker, and even if they do, why would they go to Sofi? During recent events many who left RH fled to traditional brokers  (Fidelity, Vanguard). 

**Customer Service:** Doesn’t look great so far. This is big for me and many people when a company is handling your money – will this company help you when you need it? What happened to companies wanting to provide the best service in the world? There are quite a few anecdotal reports on the Sofi subreddit of people having fraudulent charges on cards that were never even activated. The company’s community account denied there was any data breach (their account is since deleted). 

**PIPE shares:** This concept is new to me, but I came across it when researching for this post. What happens when lockup ends and the dilution comes? Short term players who do not get out in time may get hosed. 

**The good:** I do like their leadership. Their acquisition of Galileo is bullish and they have stated they want to seek out more mergers / acquisitions post IPO. Like I said earlier, they know what they need to do to be incredibly successful, but can they execute on it? Are they doing these things better than competitors, or are they just doing them?

Hi fellow traders! I’m new to options trading and I’m trying out the concepts on cheap stocks. I’m having trouble understanding why I need a certain amount of buying power (which RH doesn’t tell you) when you’re selling a call. Can someone explain it to me? TIA.

EDIT: I think I figured it out, folks. They were holding my shares for a stop loss order and therefore couldn’t place them as collateral. Problem solved! Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FVRR: A Diamond in the Rough in plain sight  Fiverr is a site for **freelancers to offer their work online**. That's a very simple statement, it's doesn't seem to offer groundbreaking value like a tech plays and at first glance, it doesn't seem to offer any reasoning why you should invest, bear with me and listen. I'll just outline a few reasons why Fiverr has been an extremely undervalued case an worthy of your investment:

(1) Fiverr has been extremely undervalued and **mispriced by at least half the Wall-street Analysts**, save for a few top ones, and its seems to be glossed over by many investors out there due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the business. Even the top Wall Street analysts on buy ratings seem to have glossed over the most important reasoning to buy the stock.

It is fundamentally, a **groundbreaking new Human Resources solution for SMEs**. It allows a marketplace for SMEs to find value talent, that would be impossible for them to source, both due to geographical and limited budgets. Say, if I run my business in a small town, how can I find talent to do my artwork for my advertisement? Fiverr provides me with the solution by offering ,say, extremely talented individuals half way across the world in less developed countries for one-tenth of the price. To be blunt, it allows SMEs to source talented individuals in less developed countries for a value play.

(2) **Fiver has close to 0 true competitors in this space**. Their so-called closest competitor 'Upwork' are targeted towards different markets. Upwork is geared towards at the higher end of the market at large corporates while Fiverr is geared towards SMEs. If you look at the way the platform is set up, they charge a much higher rate and the focus is on more complex projects. I believe there is much more talent on Fiverr that is drawn across countries and geographies which would otherwise be very very difficult to access for SMEs.

To summarize, the Fiverr platform seems to shift **whole industries** online to provide value talent which would otherwise be extreme pain points for SMEs. **In short, this is the Alibaba of HR solutions for talent sourcing.**

(3) Now, lets talk about the valuation. Fiverr is currently valued at approximately, 9 billion market cap, with 35 million shares and 20 million on float. It's at the time of writing, at $270. If you look at similar comparable, such as Etsy, both sites that offer work online, it is worth 27 billion. That's three times the market cap of Fiverr. In fact, I argue that Fiverr has a potentially larger market size than Etsy, the website offers work across a range of industries, from computing, all the way to advertising.

(4) Why its good to get in now. If you look at the amount of Fiverr stock Hedge funds have in their portfolio, a lot of them have none. There are a just a few hedge-funds with Fiverr in their portfolio (last time I check there were around \~10) and this has given them outsized gains. It doesn't help the fact that half the Wall Street analyst think that Fiverr is "just" a platform offering remote work opportunities and its only gaining steam now because of the coronavirus. That's fundamentally a mis-analysis in the true value of Fiverr.

(5) As a user of avid user of Fiverr myself, some people ask if you want to de-platform and deal with the sellers off platform. That's a big risk. Many times you are dealing with people half way across the world in places, and Fiverr gives great protection for the buyer if they don't meet quality standards, deadlines you've set etc. I've had a few cases where the seller wasn't producing the quality as expected and I got my money back 100%. I've used many platforms that don't hold your money in escrow and ask you to transfer money to the buyer in places like India. Got scammed before and not worth the hassle

\*\*Point (4) sourced from hedgefollow.com_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sportman's Warehouse (SPWH) acquired by The Great American Outdoors - did I mess up? I think I messed up.

I saw SPWH Jan'23 leaps were insanely cheap and impulsively bought 10 of them. The stock is $17.65 now, and I see that Jan 23 calls with 17.5 strike price is only about 1.00!!

I should have done my homework, it turns out they recently struck a deal to be acquired by The Great American Outdoors, for $18 a share - meaning that my calls can never reach the required 18.5 strike price. If I understand correctly, I am out $50 dollars per bought call, my $1000 investment is only worth $500. Ugh.

Is that assessment correct? There is no way that the options be converted to another type of option upon acquisition, and will simply be terminated at that point right? If so, why do brokers even allow 2023 leaps to be sold when acquisition is imminent?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Zynga and Tencent Aside from the seeking alpha article, I haven’t been able to find any other information about the possible merger between tencent and zynga.

Korea, Denmark, Norway, even the US under current administration. They have all committed to reducing their carbon emissions by 30% by the year 2030 with more countries joining in. Hundreds of millions of dollars pledged to this cause. Well that got me peaked, who us going to be performing these jobs? I have no idea, but I have found an awesome company that is global, best part, they have head quarters in each of the countries committing to building these windmill islands. American superconductors (AMSC).

Looking over their Financials, they were profitable this year except they purchased with cash another company in new York who will offer more value to their product and services.. they are becoming more and more profitable each financial report released and that tells me they have a lot of room to grow. Specific because of where they make most their money. They don't just do windmills, their main source of income is in grid efficiency, this is one of the most important factors when considering windmills in general, but more specifically windmills that are going to be harnessing ocean winds. 

Looking at current guidance, south Korea is already putting in orders and it appears (no knowing for certain) that their product is being put into bid for that contract. And regardless if those big contracts they are constantly making new smaller government contracts and will be a good long term hold.

The other half involves batteries. Energy needs a place to be stored before use, I have been searching for some battery manufacturers who may be involved with this and the best match I have found for AMSC is alussa energy. That is because both companies are built on green, efficiency, and improvement. I have no other reason to believe they will do business together except that the companies would make a good team and I believe both are great companies alone, but would dominate working together. 

Feel free to criticize, this is my first real DD post and I want to start improving my own research and collaborating with others to better hone in my research.

Hello GM,

Nice new logo BTW. Curious what is the consumer strategy here. I realize your stock does have upward momentum. 

I watched your GM electric car commercial(s) that will be played during the Super Bowl (available on YouTube).

To summarize: Will Ferrel educates America that Norway buys more electric cars than any other country and we need to “crush them” (wow! sounds like WSB’s wanting to crush the shorts).

So let’s break this down:

1. You insulted Norway (the largest consumer of your new product). Nice job👌

2. You told me nothing about why I should choose your car over others. Nice job👌

3. Curious... when someone is looking to buy a new electric car.... when the fuck do they ever think hmmm, wonder what those Norwegians are doing. Nice job👌

4. Now I’m looking at what Norwegians buy (the people who buy the most electric cards). It’s Audi and Tesla if your curious. Nice job 👌.

I get it’s comedy and comes across on TV... but this was the message? This is your entry point? If your confident... why not face Tesla? You have the hummer (American).

What was this commercial intended to instill on retailers and shareholders?

Why distract us with Norway? They have no skin in the game (other than they would buy your cars). You isolated the largest market. Crush them?!?!? THEY ARE THE LARGEST CONSUMER! 

I’m mad. I’m exiting my positions. What’s the movement here? What’s the message? What am I missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fulgent Genetics (FLGT) What do people think about this stock?

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TLRY and APHA: Potential arbitrage opportunity? Hi all, I have a question.

Cannabis companies Tilray and Aphria are slated to merge, [forming the largest global cannabis company by revenue by the end of Q2.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-stock-rockets-after-reverse-merger-deal-with-aphria-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608128018) The acquisition will happen as a reverse merger, with Aphria shares converting to approximately .83 Tilray shares post-merger. The current price of APHA is lower than .83 of a TLRY share. Perhaps I'm not understanding, but does this not mean that there's an obvious deal on APHA currently assuming the merger goes through? If the prices converge later, someone still would have been able to secure Tilray shares at a lower cost if they purchase now than simply buying Tilray shares. I'm long on Tilray, and there of course risks (merger not going through, share price dropping significantly, etc.), but assuming these two stay the course and TLRY continues to rise isn't this a simple arbitrage opportunity? What am I missing?

I additionally found an article which explains a way to limit downside (admittedly capping upside). Essentially the author suggests selling covered calls on APHA to maximize the arbitrage explained above. Would someone who is even more bullish be able to maximize returns even further by simply buying calls on APHA currently for pre-merger?

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Just some exerpts from the wiki alone https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation


1) Total assets US$46,971,101,000 (2018)


2) Several companies sued DTCC, **without success**, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for naked short selling.


3) Critics blamed DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where the naked short selling happens, alleging that DTCC **turned a blind eye** to the problem, and complaining that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.


3) DTCC responded that it had no authority over trading activities, and **could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered**, and suggested that naked shorting was simply **not widespread enough to be a major concern.**


4) In July 2007, Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah, suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling were "serious enough" to warrant a hearing. The Senate Banking Committee's Chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing. **No such hearing was ever held, however.**


5) Representing state stock regulators, the NASAA filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that "if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of **fraud and manipulation** at the hands of the very entities that **should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market**". **The suit was dismissed.** Critics also contended that **DTCC and the SEC were too secretive** with information about where naked shorting was taking place.

I tend to hold positions in stock and sell them to immediately buy a position in another stock that is hot at the time.

I don't doubt the number will still be pretty high. But in my opinion, many of the past short positions have been closed and many new ones have been opened at high values like 300$. I do believe though that they will just see a high number and rush to buy as many stocks as they possibly can.

I was thinking of buying one day prior to the release (haven't check if the data will be released pre-, during- or post open market), hoping for a surge after the report release and then soon selling everything in any scenario.

I know that's purely speculative and risky, so of course I wouldn't risk large amounts. Also, if the price doesn't fall a bit more in the next 2 days, it's also going to be a no-go for me. Is this a very stupid idea? Are many people expecting that and keeping the stock pretty stable at this price? I could also use call options (Edit: or straddle), but would have to create an account on some broker that allows them (and premiums are probably too high ATM anyways).

Also, I have two main concerns. One being the question whether they have enough money available to affect the price for a decent %.

“
On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.
 
The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.
 
The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:
 
Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.
 
Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  
 
Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.”

Main Takeaway:

Eli Lilly and Company and Precision BioSciences today announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement to utilize Precision's proprietary ARCUS® genome editing platform for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders, with an initial focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and two other undisclosed gene targets. 

ARCUS is a unique, proprietary, and versatile genome editing platform with attributes including specificity, ability to make a variety of efficient edits (knock-in, knock-out, and repair), and small size, thereby enabling a range of therapeutic editing. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Precision will receive an upfront cash payment of $100 million, as well as an equity investment by Lilly of $35 million in Precision's common stock. Precision is also eligible to receive up to $420 million in potential development and commercialization milestones per product, as well as tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to low-teens on product sales should Lilly successfully commercialize a therapy from the collaboration.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy [(DMD)](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/duchenne-dmd-gene-therapy-sarepta-pfizer/588272/):

https://imgur.com/AfynsaJ

Duchenne is a potentially deadly genetic disease that affects some 300,000 people, mostly boys, worldwide. An inherited DNA defect leaves Duchenne patients lacking dystrophin, a critical muscle-protecting protein. Without it, they progressively lose the ability to walk or function independently, often dying at a young age from lung or heart problems.

Currently treated with steroids that, at best, may slow the progression of Duchenne, however pharms have not even proven it has that correlation/causation yet. It produces very minimal dystrophin, sufficient enough for FDA for approval in order for some advancement.
___
Gene therapy and Duchenne MD:

Duchenne has been a target for gene therapy but the dystrophin gene is too large to fit into the adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, commonly used to deliver gene therapies. Current gene therapies now aim to dose patients with micro/mini dystrophin over many years at high doses.  Not yet considered a significant advance. Pfizer, Roche, other companies are aiming at gene therapy treatment.

I would be naïve to think I can sit here and explain biopharm shit to you guys because that's way out of my league, but there are key points in the presentation above that I think are huge positives that anyone can understand. Still recommend anyone to look through the entire presentation.

Basically, DMD is most frequently caused by the spontaneous loss of exons from the rod domain of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin. ARCUS' Goal?: Restore dystrophin expression by deleting exons 45-55 using a pair of ARCUS nucleases. Results?

https://imgur.com/mlTP2H0

Cells were successfully edited in a dose-dependent manner with restoration of dystrophin gene expression.

https://imgur.com/lVSgPY4

One key here is that DTIL states that technical success "unlocks" additional programs. ARCUS is an entire genome-editing platform, meaning to my understanding it is supposed knock out, replace, and edit genes, and DMD is just the first of many projects (first of 3 that Eli Lilly will collaborate with) that DTIL will develop with the use of ARCUS.

Precision BioSciences Opens First In-House cGMP Manufacturing Facility Dedicated to Genome-Edited Allogeneic CAR T Cell Therapy in the United States (July 18, 2019)

https://imgur.com/qUTJUE4

"As part of [our](https://precisionbiosciences.com/precision-biosciences-opens-first-in-house-cgmp-manufacturing-facility-dedicated-to-genome-edited-allogeneic-car-t-cell-therapy-in-the-united-states/) mission to overcome cancer and provide valuable new treatment options for patients, we are rapidly advancing a pipeline of next-generation, off-the-shelf CAR T product candidates and we anticipate, once optimized, this platform will be able to support two new clinical programs per year.”

“Given the potential output of our platform, we’ve known from the beginning that it was critical for us to address the need for scalable manufacturing of cell-therapy products in order to be able to effectively deliver them to patients. In addition to our clinical work, it also has the potential to be a commercial launch facility with the capacity to generate up to 10,000 doses of CAR T cell therapies and 4,000 doses of gene therapies per year.”

This is rather old news, but I still look at it as positive as they are showing that ARCUS is scalable in its manufacturing and DTIL is prioritizing cell-therapy/ARCUS.

Current goals for 2021. 
___
TL;DR DTIL is, from my limited understanding of bioengineering, very interesting. Their in-vivo gene editing platform is proprietary, the efficiency and accuracy could rival CRSPR systems, and they have good strategic partnerships. However, it seems to me that this company is riding on "if's", because their ARCUS programs are not even pre-clinical we have yet to see whether it will actually work. Their partnerships with Eli Lilly can only indicate that they are on the right path. If it does work, I predict that DTIL will be up there with the big boys on the genome editing industry.

In a sense, the bear case could be made based off of how far DTIL is away from showing true results. This would not be a short-term play, their catalysts solely depend on clinical results and any strategic partnerships, and their product is hard to understand to the average person which is always a big negative to me. But they have enough cash-runaway to last till 2023 and they seem to be doing well now. 

Positions: holding a few shares @ 11.20_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking into stocks for the first time. I’m a bit nervous Hello. So recently; I’ve [26M] hit rock bottom (lol). I found myself in a big loop of depression and homelessness and whatnot. But I got myself out of it recently, and now I’m looking to build wealth for myself going forward. I’ve always been interested in stocks, even in college, but I never took that first big step. Tbh I’m kinda nervous. 

What would be some good starter advice for someone like me to make smart investments and hopefully see my first big cash out.

EDIT: Guys I am stable it’s cool lol. I wouldn’t say cash out; sorry about that. I’d say more so smart investments to build myself with. Maybe I’m looking at it wrong but it still seems all very interesting to me_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NeoVolta (NEOV) a little info I’ve been watching this company for a while so I figured I’d write a little about it to see if anyone else has heard of them. I haven’t bought shares yet, but I’m thinking about taking a flyer. They are still in the early stages so this would be quite speculative, but so was Enphase at $5.00.

IPO in May, 2019. at $1.00
Currently trading around $5.50
Current market cap $101 million 

Neovolta manufactures and sells a residential energy storage systems that can be utilized during blackouts and periods when utilities hike rates. Their product is assembled in the US, which could be very beneficial under the Biden Administration. The company was started by former Marine Colonel Brent Willson who currently serves as CEO.  

They obviously have big competition from companies like Tesla, Generac and LG. One major thing that sets them apart is that they utilize a lithium iron phosphate battery which is much safer and lasts much longer. Neovolta batteries have better thermal and chemical stability than lithium ion batteries.  While lithium ion batteries are much lighter in weight they present a much bigger risk of fire. Weight is much less of an issue with a stationary product like a home energy storage system. The risk of fire presented by lithium ion batteries is eliminated with the lithium iron battery chemistry. The main disadvantage is that lithium iron phosphate costs more than lithium ion, but Neovolta is meeting or beating competitors when it comes to cost. This could also be a huge advantage in areas of the country where the utility is cutting power due to the risk of wild fires. 

Other advantages:

- Neovolta systems are much easier to install.  In an interview one installer said that they are installing the system in about six hours, while it usually takes them about a day and a half to install the Tesla product. He also said that as they perfect the installation they could probably do two a day. 
- The enclosure contains the inverter and the transfer switch. This means that the only equipment that the customer has mounted on or near their house is the enclosure and the critical load panel. A lot of competitors require a lot of unsightly equipment to be mounted on the residence. 
- The system is compatible with literally any solar array, new or legacy, micro inverter or string inverter. It is directly compatible with DC arrays. This means retrofitting with older legacy arrays is simple, seamless and much less expensive. 
- Since Neovolta can accept DC or AC power, there is no need to purchase an additional inverter. This is also more efficient since every time power is inverted from DC to AC and back again, you lose about 6% efficiency. Most competitors will invert DC from the array to AC (for use in the home) and then back to DC to store in the battery. 
- They have recently added generator compatibility.   The system can be integrated with a generator which reduces battery usage. This is ideal for people who experience extended power outages.  Customers can also charge the battery via the generator. 

Neovolta started by offering the NV14, a 14.4 KWh system which is capable of powering a typical home for up to 18 hours. It has been named a “Solar Power World Top Solar Storage Product” in 2019 and again in 2020. This system can now be expanded to 24 KWh without having to buy an additional inverter.  The 24 KWh add on can be retrofitted to the existing NV14 in about 90 minutes. For comparison a single Tesla power wall offers 13.5 KWh, Generac Power Cell 20.2 KWh. 

The company also just came to an exclusive distribution agreement with Nevada based PMP Energy. PMP has the opportunity to secure exclusive geographic rights in exchange for making minimum purchases of $15 Million. PMP is currently distributing the product  in, Nevada,  Arizona, Utah, Oklahoma, Georgia, North Carolina and Puerto Rico. PMP is currently rolling out distribution in Florida.  As of December, 2020 PMP’s purchase orders totaled $902,00 with the most recent reorder totaling $425,000. Neovolta manages its own distribution network in California with 37 dealers state wide. They are expecting big growth in 2021 and recently acquired additional manufacturing space near their original facility. 

It may be too early to tell because financial info is sparse, but it could be a good one to keep an eye on if they can execute.

A market where the size of each publicly traded company in terms of capital is used to calculate a total share volume for the overall market. These shares, having no affiliation to a particular company, are then distributed amongst society such that each person has an equal number of shares to invest and trade within a given time window.

In this hypothetical scenario, shares are more like "free agents" and are affiliated as time passes and society invests/trades. At the end of this investing/trading window, the share's affiliations are converted to the company's capital, at which point the cycle is repeated as capital is once again summed and shares re-distributed.

Do you think a market using this system could sustain itself and show growth? If so, what are some issues that a society could encounter from using a market system that operates like this?

The question that is really baking my noodle in this thought experiment: What would be the optimal window of time to operate a market system like this before applying the rolling share reset?

I'm not an economist and haven't studied markets in depth, this is just a thought I had when trying to picture an alternative system of running a hypothetical free market that could sustain itself and show growth.

The question I want to ask you guys would be are existing big names like Apple, Wal-mart  and etc are still worth it to invest in?

\*Not asking for finical advice just your thoughts\*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about how stocks work I just started investing, and I understand the basics of *why* a person would invest in stocks, because they want the price to go up, but *where* does the value of a stock actually come from? I understand that it's a small share of a company, so that you partially own the company, but it's not like you really get anything, except from stocks that pay dividends.

With other goods, such as coffee, there's an endpoint. If you ask a distributer why they're buying coffee from farmers, they'll tell you it's so that they can sell it at a higher price to grocery stores. If you ask grocery stores why they bought it, they'll tell you it's so they can sell it at a higher price to customers. If you ask a customer why he bought it, he'll tell you it's so that he can drink coffee. He's the end of the chain, the point where somebody gets actual value, the reason why somebody would grow coffee in the first place. Same thing with gold, there is a point in the chain where someone can use it to make electronics or jewelry.

As far as I can tell, buying stock is an infinitely regressive chain, where you can ask the buyer why they bought it, and the answer is so that they can sell it at a higher price, then you ask the person who bought it from the initial seller why *they* bought it, then they'll say the same thing, on down the chain to infinity.

-----

Hello fellow investors, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

 1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google, Stratasys and the likes.

 2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

 3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

 4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

 5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

 6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

 7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

 8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-fit-cathie-woods-173506543.html)

 9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

 1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

 2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21, 9 calls for $35 05/21, 1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock.
