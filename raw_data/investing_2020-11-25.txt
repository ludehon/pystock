Here are some stats:_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Index funds buying Tesla Hi community!

Have been thinking about this for some time now. Thought r/investing might also be interested to brainstorm with me on this. I try to keep it short and simple.

\- So current thesis is, that as Tesla will be included in SP500 in December, the price of stock will keep on rising from the buying pressure of index funds that must include the stock.

\- Back in September, decision not to include Tesla, caused more than 30% sell off (although there were other reasons for more than 30% retracement, such as market wide sell-off etc.).

Now lets make few assumptions and **please not let argue about those**, because i would rather love to see some theories on the subject i am about to propose. The assumptions are as follows:

\- Tesla stock price is in a bubble.

\- Decision committee that decides on inclusion, is not stupid.

\- Fund managers + committee and other parties involved talk to each other, are not stupid either.

\- Before mainstream and retail is informed, fund managers get the information somewhat earlier (lets please not argue about the legal aspects of this assumption).

Now what i am thinking, funds would like to avoid buying an asset with inflated value and would prefer to have as low entry point as possible. Now i am thinking, if i was party involved in either the decision making of inclusion and/or fund manager, what would my game plan be in October and at the start of November. 

So what i came up with as my best guess. My best game strategy would be to in this instance to purchase significant amount of \~monthly call options around the strike price of $500, knowing that once the information is made public, those call options would bring in a very nice profit and would help to significantly lower my entry price. Now somewhere around now, as price keeps steadily increasing, i would buy montly put options with a strike price around $400. And in a week or two, once i have enough, as pre accepted strategy with committee, i would make a public statement about "some ongoing research into SP inclusion and therefore until further notice, Tesla will not be included". Share price would plummet significantly and i would again make a nice 10x for example, on my put options. Now with the profits from both calls and those calls further invested into puts, i have more than enough profits, to now either purchase directly or exercise the options to have far more reasonable entry price for the stock. In a small cap entry, i would not even think (much) about such theory, but Tesla is currently just about to take worlds 9th place by market cap and its weight and effect on funds and SP500 is significant. Tin foil hat off.

So community, what do you think about my strategy/thesis as a theoretical commitee/fund manager member and what are your thoughts about commitee and fund managers going through October and November, knowing very well, that if by doing anything by the rules, they would need to buy into very inflated asset and overall, inclusion decision at current time would not be the smartest decision. Do you think they even care or need to care on these matters? Maybe they wont and that would make my whole point invalid.

I would be very interested in your thoughts on this matter. And please again, lets try not discuss and argue about those 4 assumptions i made above. 

Many thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Guns & Weed Americans loaded up on guns in response to the pandemic. It doesn’t take a genius to predict a similar spike in response to Biden winning the election. The bulk of this sale spike may not have even materialized since many of the biggest gun buyers still expect Trump to stay in power, and also because discretionary spending has been impaired without a second round of stimulus and persistent unemployment. Another round of stimulus checks and a full concession by Trump will spur unprecedented gun sales. The market leaders, Smith & Wesson (SWBI) and Ruger (RGR), are my picks because reasons but it doesn’t really matter since it’s an industry play. 

For the longer term, will Biden have the political ability, or time, to take on the gun industry? Probably not. He will piss people off whether he takes a strong stance on guns or not, but with Trump gearing up for a 2024 run, Biden has more to lose politically by pissing off gun loving conservatives than progressives who will vote for him in 2024 no matter what.

What'd y'all think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APXT: Merging with AvePoint APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

Disclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Impact from Capital Gains Tax Increases While the new administration has been clear that the [40% capital gains tax only applies to households in excess of $1M earnings annually](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-biden-capital-gains-tax/fact-check-biden-willonlytax-capital-gainsat-40for-those-earning-over-1-million-annually-idUSKBN26Z2CA), it strikes me that this might have a negative impact on the market which many are unaware of entirely.

The Long-Term Capital Gains provides investors an incentive for staying in the market longer (>1yr) and investing in a company's future, rather than focusing purely on short term gains due to being taxed higher. The equitable increase to a federal income tax for those high earners would seem to accomplish the following:

* Potentially reduce cap gains income for the government because those in the market will want to wait until the tax is reduced to realize their gains
* De-incentivize new investments because of the tax burden if they need to exit the market when taxes are so high

Is there any precedent for this in the past? What might those high-earning households look to as alternative investment vehicles, if anything?

The only counter I can see to this is that with the fed rate as low as it is, stocks are really the only way to realize gains in the current market so there may not be other options.

Dividend yield is currently at around 5% annual. Non-GAAP PE is at 11.52 (but GAAP EPS is negative for the last year). Hit the bottom at 19.99 back in March and is up 50% since then at around 33. Earnings have been beating estimates, dividend has been consistently paid out, and the numbers in general seem to mostly be trending in the right direction. I like that it is a decidedly old school, non-tech company to provide some balance with the tech heavy indexes. I would not expect huge growth moving forward, but the dividend yield means that matters a bit less. 

From reading up on the history, it seems that they were caught by a combination of misplaying the trend towards less processed foods while being spread too thin (yes, I went there) across too many brands and products. Berkshire then stepped in at the worst time thinking they were getting a classic Buffett value play and then basically ran them into the ground with things like Kraft Heinz merger and attempts to cut costs. 2019 was a particularly ugly year with losses, a dividend cut, and an SEC probe into accounting practices. 

That prompted a C-suite reboot and reassessment in strategy and things seem to be looking up since. It seems that many are writing that off as COVID related as people are buying more food for at home. There is certainly some truth to that, but clearly COVID is not going away soon unless the vaccine roll out is absolutely flawless, and even post-COVID, I feel this year's performance has given them the opportunity to reestablish themselves in a way that should carry forward. 

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does Palantir have a scaling issue going forward? &#x200B;

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are commentaries as good as the book?

Is there any research showing a correlation between insider trading and stock performance?

Do you look at it? How often do you do it before deciding to buy/sell an equity?

Where do you find this data typically?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the point of non 100/0 long-term portfolios? For example, why would somebody interested in long-term investing want a portfolio made up of 80% stock and 20% bonds. I usually hear people talk about bonds as a means to help protect against the huge swings of the stock market and as a pool of capital to invest in the stock market when it goes down and people want to buy stocks "on sale".

If you have a long-term portfolio, why would you care about big swings early in the portfolio's lifetime? While I understand having bonds ready to invest in the stock market whenever it dips, I'm curious about how much rebalancing a manager would do within an XX/YY account. Will they sell the bonds and buy stocks when the market dips, or are they too constrained by the ratios defining the account?

Additional, tangentially related question: I've also heard of people using bonds as a relatively liquid asset in the event of needing cash while your stocks are down. In this case, it sounds like an extra emergency fund. If that is true, why would you want a percentage and not just a fixed amount?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JC Penney, The Golden Rule, The basis of a 100plus year old company This company, JC Penney, operating for many decades on its founding principles Of The Golden Rule is now is bankruptcy, and is about be sold for pennies on the dollar.

Nissan Motor Co. is the first and only car manufacturer I’ve ever invested in. The company tanked earlier this year and then came the pandemic and things only got worse for them.

Their [losses](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nissan-cuts-annual-operating-loss-081055925.html) the past 18 months have been horrible. That being said, I still see a car manufacturer with huge distribution networks across Asia and a well working production capacity. They make cars on several segments, and they have a clear plan to make high-end EVs.

How? (this topic mostly focuses in the US) 

**1)** Climate change, a carbon-free world has been pushing us towards investing in renewable energy for the past few years mostly solar and wind but the investment in those has not been great and coal produced energy has been mostly replaced by natural gas which emits 50-60% CO2 than coal but still not zero. So the solution is if you want complete carbon-free is nuclear. But Americans we have a problem with that. Since the end of 1990s , not a single nuclear plant been built in the USA because we are scared of it. Chernobyl, 1970s " The China syndrome" movie (btw, imo, the most powerful movie probably in the world that was able to kill the whole industry) etc. 

2) things might change, Joe Biden has a plan. and not the little plan but 2 Trillion $ plan! Joe Biden is interested in nuclear power (also in solar and wind, but I believe those are quite inefficient vs nuclear and does not create high paying jobs as Joe says)   especially in SMRs (small Module Reactors) - which are less risky , more efficient to build- does not require >8-10 years to construct like current nuclear power plants. (meaning less CAPEX, fast ROE)

If we need to live up to Paris Climate accord and build carbon free world, it seems nuclear power is the way. Currenly, US's 50% renewable energy is coming from nuclear which is also 20% of total electricity generated - making the US biggest nuclear energy generator. However , compared to France for instance, nuclear stands for more than 80% of electricity. 

So, the question is who might benefit if Biden goes nuclear (pun intended). Unfortunately, there are not many public companies focused on SMRs . One I could find was NuScale which is private. But it is majority owned by Fluor Corporation (publicly traded) and what I found online that they might have a contract with BWX Technologies (major customer is Sovereign - submarine, navy). Anyways, I could write down here for pages but tried to keep short. 

what you think? need opinions? Can there be future for nuclear under Biden admin? if there will be, then Nuclear Industry ETF is another thing you might own._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ THCB merging with Microvast Extremely exciting play.
