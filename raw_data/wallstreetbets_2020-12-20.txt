 PLTR to the moon if it breaks resistance 🚀 🌙 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opendoor - Welcome to the Stratosphere Alright fucktards listen up. This contains almost 0 fundamental analysis and is based purely on speculation and my gut feeling. This past week, IPOB, one of Chamath Palijizzapia's 5,000 SPACs, completed its merger with Opendoor. CEO Eric Wu-tang is ringing the NASDAQ bell tomorrow, and Opendoor Technologies will officially trade under the ticker OPEN. I feel like this may be the biggest & best SPAC deal to date, and the stock will go absolutely stratospheric. Here's why:

Opendoor is actually a real fucking company already doing billions in revenue. Are they profitable? No, but they have a path to profitability and also no one gives a shit these days. They are a tech-centric real estate disrupter startup unicorn. Tech + disrupter \* startup = moon. I worked at this company for a bit, and they are run by some of the smartest fuckers I have ever met. Their machine-learning algo is prime and continues improving every day. Soon it will replace all humans on earth.

I know, the naysayers are gonna pipe up about "margins" and "unproven business model". I don't give a shit. It doesn't matter. Opendoor's arch-rival Zillow (Z) is trading at a 5.45 EV-Sales, while Opendoor is somewhere around 2.5 EV-Sales. OPEN also did 4.4x more sales than Z in 2019. Z is playing catchup and does not yet have the infrastructure nor technology to compete with OPEN. You might bring up RDFN. Don't give a fuck, they're irrelevant.

With the flight from cities only just beginning, near 0 interest rates for the foreseeable future, and the economy opening back up post-vaccine, this all plays swimmingly into OPEN's hands. They will crush all opposition and eventually be the first thing you think of when someone mentions residential real estate.

TL;DR: Stimulus check on OPEN 02/19/21 40c.

Edit: Forgot to mention that ARKK has a shit ton of shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You all made this happen. I fucked up and took some profits, but she said yes, so I guess that’s worth something. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Brand new close to NAV SPAC merging with a fintech unicorn: AJAX alright listen up my fellow retards, if you're tired of chasing pltr, gme, and whatever the meme stock of the week is, i got some serious dd for you

AJAX or [AJAX I Acquisition Corp](https://ajaxcap.com/team/) is a fintech SPAC led by Dan Och(co-founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group with 50b+ AUM and founder/current chairman of Willoughby Capital) and Glenn Fuhrman(founder of MSP capital with 20b+ AUM). these are some big fucking players, and their board of advisors is even more stacked: 
- James Morgan--co-founder of Square 
- Kevin Systrom--co-founder/former CEO of Instagram
- Steve Ells--founder/former CEO of Chipotle
- Anne Wojcicki--co-founder and CEO of 23andMe. 
there are also a bunch of higher-up fucks from Dan Och's hedge fund willoughby capital on the key investment team.

let's look at their [sec filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-030803/). if you can't read, they're targeting a merge with a business in the **internet, software, fintech, and consumer industries**. from the same sec report, you can see that willoughby capital's investments include Coinbase, Github, Instacart, Robinhood, **Stripe**, and **Transferwise**.

let's be real, stripe is a big dick player and probably doesn't need a spac to IPO. if it does turn out to be stripe, i'm fucking rich. more likely it'll be TransferWise. 

you're probably thinking, what the fuck is TransferWise and why should I invest in it?
TransferWise is a fintech unicorn that is relatively unknown and is still in its hypergrowth stage. I won't go too much into the financials of TransferWise because i'm a goddamn retard but I will provide some basic numbers and a link to [the source](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/transferwise-reports-accelerating-revenue-growth-to-70-in-its-march-2020-fiscal-year/): 
- Fiscal 2020 revenue: £302.6 million, up 70% from its fiscal 2019 result of £179 million 
- 8 million worldwide customers, up from 6 million in the preceding fiscal year or 33%. 
- Fourth year of consecutive profitability 
- $5 billion valuation in July of 2020 

the cherry on top? the day after AJAX goes public, it was announced that TransferWise has [started hiring banks for an IPO](https://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-to-hire-banks-for-blockbuster-float-12167155). 

tl;dr ajax will very possibly merge with fintech unicorn TransferWise, get the fuck in here before it takes off

Huge Forced Selling Next 2 Weeks (This was posted Sunday afternoon before futures open) 

If 2020 has taught us anything it’s that the flow of money predicts stock movements not the news or the actual state of things. 

We are coming up into the period where pensions and 60/40 mutual funds do rebalance in the r/investing style to make sure they have the right balance of stocks and bonds* to their target. A great example of this is the epic day after Christmas rally we had in 2018 where spx was up 7% or something, and there were multi billion block orders of boomer stocks being bought, since the market was down 19% for the quarter. We saw similar buying in the last weeks of March well after the fed already said it was going to support. May have been at play then too. 

Well, stocks went up a lot faster than bonds this year, and more importantly, faster this quarter. That means selling stocks not buying them. 

JPM estimated the forced selling to be around 300 billion, when they wrote in November. 

https://www.investmentnews.com/jpmorgan-says-rebalancing-could-mean-300-billion-exits-stocks-199638

I assume that number is between 400 and 500b now as stonks are even more up now. 

On top of that, active managers and pensions often have rules about how big they can be in a sector, industry or stock. Tech, especially Tesla and a couple covid boom stocks, are going to be well over these thresholds and due for a sale. Tesla has its own factors at play with everyone on this sub and elsewhere buying shares and calls before the spx inclusion to sell into. 

It’s possible some of this selling of all equities already happened. But, in past years, the final 2 weeks had a lot of it, usually starting around this coming Monday at open. 

Coming back to my flows comment - the news may be pretty good - Biden bullish on green, stimulus being passed. But that’s news. News is small compared to flows. And if this 500b sell manifests and concentrates on tech/highly appreciated names, you could see a lot of price action down in the thin liquidity holiday market.

I’m very short going into this but ready to buy calls on a correction since I think it would be temporary. And those stim checks go right into meme stock calls...

Positions: lots of nq $11900 puts dec 31, lots of TSLA $580 puts dec 31. Vix calls end of month $30. Also, huge limit order buy for tsla at $420.69

*bonds in case you don’t know are these super lame pieces of paper your boomer parents have that pay guaranteed almost 0% returns. Kind of like your checking account but worse. No idea why anyone buys them.

Edit: so far looks true, though I’m getting mutant virus help. Of course that mutant virus can’t evade vaccine apparently, so if this persists it’s more likely related to this_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MT - a further dive into why this IS the steel play of 2021 Fresh off by two day ban in WSB jail, giving me plenty of time to further dive into why $MT is going to moon in 2021.

First about $MT:

* They are the world's LARGEST steel maker - and its not even close after #2.  [https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html)
* ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the 3rd quarter, **the lowest level since ArcelorMittal’s creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders**.
* The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to **launch a $500 million share buyback.**
*  Under the terms of the sale, **ArcelorMittal has received $505 million cash, 78 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock and non-voting preferred stock which is redeemable for approximately 58 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock or an equivalent amount in cash -** meaning if $CLF performs well, $MT further benefits.
* $MT has been selling off assets in the US for years to take advantage of currency advantage of manufacturing in Canada and cost labor advantage of manufacturing in Mexico:

**Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:**

*“This transaction is a unique opportunity for ArcelorMittal to unlock significant value for shareholders while retaining exposure to the North American economy through our high-quality NAFTA assets alongside a participation in what will be a stronger, better integrated, US business. I would like to thank all employees of ArcelorMittal USA for their hard work in ensuring the business maintained its reputation as a trusted, quality supplier of steels for American manufacturing. I am confident you will have a bright future with Cleveland-Cliffs.”*

* Favorable valuation achieved for ArcelorMittal USA due to the high synergistic potential of the combined company. The Transaction valuation for ArcelorMittal USA equates to an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6x through-the-cycle EBITDA.
* ArcelorMittal will participate in the upside potential of the larger combined company, which is more diversified, fully-integrated and has significant synergy potential
* The deconsolidation of the associated liabilities at ArcelorMittal USA, comprising mostly pension and OPEB liabilities, will improve the Group’s risk profile, reduce net debt and strengthen its capital structure and credit metrics.

Let's move on to mining because there are many that claim $VALE is the play because of iron ore.  $VALE is a good play, but $MT as it pertains to mining:

*  $MT is active in the whole value chain, from exploration and development to mining, concentration, pelletizing, rail transport and port operations. With operations that span Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia, we aim to optimize our portfolio so we can deliver results at any point in the economic cycle, and to manage our assets to the highest standards. We are equally driven to mine responsibly and sustainably, minimizing the impact of mining on the natural environment, and working closely with local communities to build skills and social infrastructure to ensure long-term development.
* We have a geographically diversified portfolio of 14 operating units in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and United States that in 2019 produced **57.1 million tons of iron ore and 5.5 million tons of coking coal. Our main products include iron ore lump, fines, concentrate pellets and sinter feed, and coking coal, thermal coal and pulverized coal injection (PCI) coal.**

**VERTICAL INTEGRATION -** so the largest steel maker in the world supplies over half of it's raw materials - allowing them to cost average down higher ore prices, thus expanding their margins on finished product.

That brings me to the current DEMAND>>>>>SUPPLY situation the world is in regarding raw materials and finished goods.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE 2005, peaking like a rocket in 2008.  It had more legs in 2008, but the Great Recession put an abrupt end to the party.

Here is where we stand as of last week:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgt45uzbge661.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4357d0d4adce59d8ca1de95c7d039976e24afd

Here is an overall look of the past 18 years, notice 2008 and current action:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Starting to mirror 2008 action](https://preview.redd.it/37avzrvshe661.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5380d1b84263c0dc7ba7ddbb04f2a7b7d517422)

In 2008 $MT was trading at the following:

&#x200B;

[The run up and peak before the Great Recession collapse](https://preview.redd.it/t1nicl3oie661.png?width=1931&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a38b26fcefa2815baf39e518d917db28795ce0)

The difference between 2008 and today - there was more uncertainty believe it or not then in 2008 than today.  Banks were going out of business, the total collapse in mortgage backed securities and people walking away from homes.  Who in their right mind would ever want to own a home again?

Well, that has changed dramatically, while things are still a bit uncertain - vaccines are rolling out world-wide.  Interest rates are at all time lows and will be in the US until at least 2023.  The exodus of people from high tax states and cities due to "work from home" changes has created a housing boom in the suburbs and rural areas.  Homes need steel for foundations, fasteners and more importantly large appliances - dishwashers, washers, dryers, stoves, etc.  Have you seen Whirlpool stock this year?  $74 to $188, went over $200 - demand and higher steel prices = higher revenues.  When new homes and communities are built - the infrastructure follows -schools, hospitals, government buildings, shopping - all large projects that use massive amounts of steel.

Speaking of interest rates, outside of the US in recent years, an increasing number of central banks have resorted to low-rate policies. Several, including the European Central Bank and the central banks of Denmark, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, have started experimenting with ***negative interest rates*** **—essentially making banks pay to park their excess cash at the central bank. The aim is to encourage banks to lend out those funds instead, thereby countering the weak growth that persisted after the 2008 global financial crisis.** 

The point being to all of this is **THIS IS NOT A LIQUIDITY CRISIS** like we saw in 2008 - banks are printing money at a rate that we are seeing inflation and hyper inflation in commodity prices - the US Dollar Index now stands at the lowest level since January of 2014 and is expected to further decline. A weaker US Dollar buys less in foreign goods, thus further increasing the price of imported goods.

Ok, now that I have bored you to death here is the point:

**$MT TAKEAWAYS:**

* Upgraded by SocGen to $39 PT - they doubled EBITDA estimates for 2021 and 2022 **50% above market consensus.**

* Jeffries maintains buy rating with $27 PT

*  ArcelorMittal has held recent discussions with automakers over annual contracts and has been **targeting a €100-120/t increase**, according to market participants. Carmakers negotiating backdated deals have staunchly refused to pay such increases after securing rollovers or slight discounts from other mills. **But those negotiating calendar-year 2021 prices have been left with little room to negotiate, given the rocketing spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants**. 
*  The company’s current stock price of a little over $23 reflects a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 6x, which is lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 7.2x for major iron ore miners and much lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 12.8x for the broader metals and mining industry.  **Thus, at this point ArcelorMittal’s stock seems to be undervalued.** It should be $36-$38 based on this alone.

I believe we will see some bigger moves of $MT over the next 6-8 weeks.  

My PT is $30 to $40 (BULL) by mid-February and believe earnings in February will smash expectations, further gapping up the stock like we saw in 2007-08.

I do not believe we will see $300 again this cycle, but SUPER BULL scenario could be $100, as I now believe based on futures orders now being pushed at to May, there are further legs for increases throughout 2021.  

I like the common stock, based on the undervalue P/E multiple alone.

I love the options for Feb-June based on earnings and anticipation of a blow-out quarter as more is reported daily on steel and shortages.

This has to be one of the best videos they have ever put out. I have never seen a video where someone so condescendingly tries to prove the guest wrong and it turns out the guest is 100% right. Just goes to show the arrogance on wall street and how stupid some of these fund managers truly are.

Pt. 1 - Smokestacks Whaddup cock womblers, its ya boy, Chingy, back once again to inquire about about the length of yo chain and its mineral composition. I'm a proud member of the WSB weekend squad -- we're like the Tuesday afternoon squad at a strip club, so don't expect to get a lap dance from Carmen Electra circa 2003. I don't even know how to show you my crayon collection. But I don't usually have time to write DD's while I'm flipping burgers at Wendy's 9-5, so this is what you get.

My last post caused me to get DMed some smart questions, and some not-so-smart questions. So, because it's cold af outside and I can't stand any weather that's too cold for flip flops, I stayed my ass in my fortress of solitude, surrounded by my jizz rags, the whole damn weekend thinking about this play. If you're illiterate or need TL;DRs and rocket emojis, then pass by. If you're looking to play weeklies and other FDs, then pass by. I do have some moonshot plays I'm doing as well, and if ya'll yodel on my chode enough, I might tell you about them, but no, this DD is for 1/3 of the centerpiece of my 2021 play. That's right, I actually try and plan moves a year out and then measure the results over weeks rather than fucking minutes, you fucking head-trauma goldfish.

Basically, my play breaks down into 3 segments: Smokestacks, Ships, and Mines. I'll break down my DD on smokestacks with some of my top picks here. If ya'll want, I'll do Part 2 and 3 for Ships and Mines, but shit would be too long if I did it all at the same time, and I know many of you are already glossy eyed over this wall of text.  My last post was directed at MT gang, because they were seeing what I am seeing but let's have a quick re-cap to the current situation, the past, and the future so that you can understand the macroeconomic context of this play.

**The Prologue**

Let's start in 2018. We could go back further, and for some of the stocks in Part 2 and 3, we will, but 2018 is a good place to start. What happened in 2018? Well, something pretty major, something pretty fucking epically stupid which will likely be corrected in the near term and bring us tendies in the long-term. Metals began a pretty gnarly slump in early 2018, and that slump drug a lot of things down; the whole materials sector flopped, dry goods shippers and bulkers flopped, mines flopped. It was shit show. Why? Trump put his retarded ass tariffs in place. They didn't do shit except cause the market to go down faster than a Kentucky truck stop whore. Even if you look at US Steel, it spiked after the announcement, then sank with the rest of the market. Why? Because increased costs tanked demand. This is proof that just because someone knows how to get slack-jawed cousin fuckers to part with their money for some magical red hats, that they don't know fuck all about economics. Now, what you may not know is that those tariffs applied to things besides steel too, basically all the metals, and we're going to be picking up on all of that. Love it or hate it, Biden is an old-school free-trade neo-liberal, and he's going to get rid of that dumbass tariff, and that means more money moving in the market, which means more tendies for us. In removing the tariff, other countries will likely also remove their tariffs on American materials, so everyone wins and can have a big old globalist circle jerk about it, but my money is on the European and South American materials makers.

In fact, I only have two American steel stocks in my play because Trump's retard tariff caused more harm to American industry than to global industry. How? The rest of the world kept trading with each other and we got locked out, so in a recovery play, I'm looking at companies that have fewer barriers to global market, existing global orders, and companies who don't have to start from scratch in re-joining the global recovery, which excludes most American companies because holy fuck did Trump screw the pooch and provide a lovely gift to everyone who isn't American. Removing the tariffs is also going to cause pain to American steel because their safety blanket get pulled away - a problem foreign metal won't have. Yes, yes, American steel like X and CFL will do alright too long-term, but they have more headwinds getting back into the global market that the tariffs made them uncompetitive in. Another consequence of the tariffs is that they didn't actually touch raw iron ore, whose prices remained fairly high, thus pushing the cost of of American steel comparatively higher, giving a double whammy to the cost of American steel compared to others who were moving downwards faster, thus shifting demand to countries that didn't have tariffs.

**The Play (well...one third of it)**

So let's have a look at who is in my play. I call this the "Smokestacks" segment, this is where the raw ore gets turned into something useful. I'll give you the ticker symbol, my positions, and a quick reason why I like it besides the other reasons I mention in this post. So even if you think the tariffs will stay, there's other good reasons to look at these.

**MT ( July 24c & shares)**. *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. 3 recent price increases on its products. It's a meme.*

**AA (July 23c & shares)**  *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Curtailment of mass layoffs. Aluminum prices also on rebound. Actually engaging in some sustainability efforts, which may get favorable treatment from eco-conscious buyers. All facilities 100% operational.*

**STLD (Jan 2022 37c & shares)**. *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Upcoming Texas expansion. TSLA cybertruck steel supplier*

**T K A M Y (Shares)** *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Exposure to maritime market will allow it to catch the wave as cruise ships return to service and shippers upgrade and repair their fleets. Look for lots of drydock repairs in Q4 2021 to continue to lift the value*

**A N I O Y (Shares)**. *I don't really have a reason to include this one besides the basic reasons of this DD, but everything else is pretty slow and steady, so I thought I should include one roulette/heart-attack stock.*

**CMC (June 20c & shares)** *I wouldn't buy into this at the moment of publication of this DD, wait for it to dip and for that weekly moving average to get back above the market price. I think it's got another 10%-15% of growth in it and it wouldn't be as hard hit by tariff removal due to presence in other markets (it's the only other American company on my list for that reason, but there's a reason I'm generally bearish on American steel) Tariff removal is going to be good for metals, but not necessarily American ones, at least in the short-term, but I think this one will weather it a bit better.*

**TX (May 30c & shares)**. *Just look at that weekly moving average. Still has about 33% room for recovery. Integrating AI into production management.*

**SID (June 4c & shares).** *This one actually was a rocket, and I expect growth to slow a bit short term, but ITM calls are still cheap, although I'd wait for a pullback. But it's doing well, considering doing a separate IPO for their mining unit, which, by the way, is another reason I like this one, it straddles both the smokestacks and mining Segment. Ore prices have remained high despite metals slump, so since they are in both ore and metals, I like them for growth beyond recovery.*

**G M B X F (Shares)**. *I am hesitant to include this in the smokestacks segment rather than the mines segment, but they're pretty well vertically integrated, so I'll include them in both. Copper market is an undervalued play as well, and these guys are one of the big dicks in that arena. I'll expand my thoughts on this one and other miners like VALE, SCCO, and RIO in Part 3.*

**Breaking it Down, Pepe Silvia Style**

So let's look at these real quick. I've got positions in all of them, but maybe you don't want go as deep on the chain as I have, so do your own DD and figure out which you like. Most of these are non-American (STLD and CMC being the exceptions). As I mentioned above, I'm more bullish on foreign metals because the removal of the tariffs is going to have a bigger, positive impact on them, while removing the tariffs will initially have a negative impact on American steel. I'm also more bullish on foreign metals because they've been able to continue to trade in each others markets and thus have less catching-up to do in the recovery. Why did I include STLD and CMC? I like STLD because they seem to be in a growth phase right now, I'm looking for an expansion in Texas to potentially break ground in 2021, and I like CMC because they have more foreign exposure than many of their US competitors (they're a member of EuroFER, for example, X is the only other US member of that, and it's just a small Polish subsidiary).

Before getting into when you can expect tendies, let's revisit the current situation and look towards the future to understand why I'm bullish on metals at all, and foreign ones in particular.  As mentioned, we all now know that the Tantrump Tariff was a shit show that brought the market down by artificially spiking prices (2018) and that depressed demand (2018 & 2019), which ultimately drove down the prices to the shithole they've been in. Then, the pandemic hit and really hammered on it. But, the demand never really went away, it just went into hibernation. 2018-2019 saw major slow downs in domestic industrial growth; fewer and smaller expansions and some pretty large ones that were canceled outright. From my professional experience (I'm an economic developer for the G men), I can tell you that 2018 was the worst year we had. I usually shuffle 3-4 projects across my desk a month, we had 3 the entire year of 2018. Shit was grim. I even visited Europe to go talk to the companies and ask them why they were pulling out, "we'll call you in 2 years" is what they said. And guess what cock goblins!? They have! All the companies I was courting had the need and desire to expand, but backed off because of what was going on in the market, their ROI would've been too low to cover the debt of their expansions because the cost for those expansions had magically gone up overnight thanks to the fart bubble muncher in the White House. So you may be wondering, "but if steel prices are going up again, why are industrials pulling the trigger on expansions now?" Good question, retard! Part of the answer is that they've been sitting on cash for 2 years that they otherwise would've invested in growth, part of the answer is that steel prices are now naturally rising (due to the scaling back of production capacity since 2018) and thus unlikely to be waited out, and they are still lower than before the whole tariff fiasco started, and removing the tariff would keep some downward pressure on prices while juicing demand. Basically, when the price of metals artificially spiked due to the tariffs, it made sense to try and wait them out, but to those who were mining and making the metals, it meant they suddenly had a big drop in anticipated demand, and so they had to scale back,  but keep their prices up. But like I said, the demand didn't die, it just wanted to wait for a better time. Now we're in an interesting situation; prices are rising naturally due to that pent-up demand and deferred growth wanting to come out, the scale back in production capacity has created a premium on what can be produced, and future economic conditions are better for it, especially since Biden is more likely to re-engage in free-trade than whatever retarded-ass protectionist nonsense the village idiot of Mar-a-Lago was doing to gin up the mouth-breathers. But the production capacity needs to recover and then keep growing to meet demand, and that's where we get on.

**The Payoff**

So what does all of that mean for your tendies? Well, it means that the the whole supply chain that has been running a skeleton crew for the past 2 years is about to wake the fuck up. Demand from 2 years ago is re-entering the pipeline, natural growth is starting to show back up, those retard tariffs are probably on their way out. For the life of me, I can't explain how real estate has weathered the pandemic so well, but it has, and that sustained demand is part of what is driving up the cost on structural steel. Shit. Those prices are going up so fast even shippers are scrapping their old ships to get in on it. I'll discuss this more in Part 2 and why it means dry goods shippers and bulkers are gonna be in victory lane as well, but that's for next time. For now, let's stick to how we're going to make money off the smokestacks.

The first thing to note here, and I'll even bold it, is: ***THIS IS NOT A ROCKET.*** If you're gonna choose an emoji, find a freight train (also in Part 2). Alright? Don't be asking me if January calls are what you should get, because the answer is no unless you're talking about 2022. No, this is a long ass train, loaded with tendies, slowly heading up the green dollar hills towards you. All you gotta do is put money in and wait. If you're looking for FDs and quickly flipping shit, you might get lucky with some of these companies, but for the most part, all you gotta do is wait. Trust me, I know how difficult that can be when you're addicted to refreshing your account between every tug on your dick, but that's what this calls for. That means set your charts to daily or weekly and don't worry about a red day, there will be some of those along the way, maybe even red weeks, especially if some other populist cock gobbler decides to throw a wrench into the global economy or China does something retarded. Don't even worry about it until its warm enough to start breaking out flip flops again. Alright? Steel hands guys, steel hands. This isn't tech where you throw up a couple more servers, hire more people, and suddenly call yourself scaled up. No, it takes a long time for iron to be busted out of a mine, get shipped, be processed, and sold. So this isn't a good candidate for YOLO unless you don't mind watching a YOLO in slow motion. No, this is a tycoon play where you put your money on the train and wait for it to arrive.

Personally? I think end of Q2 and Q3 is where you'll see today's market catalysts show up as earnings, my earliest position is for May, and even that makes me a little nervous for how soon it really is, but I think that's when the feasting might start showing up in reports and I see it going well into 2022.

**TL;DR** We gonna make money like a freight train; slow, steady, and loaded with more tendies than any rocket can carry. If you wanna hop on the freight train like some fucking hobo, then join Tycoon Gang. If you want to see my DD for Ships/Trains, Mines, and maybe even one for industrial services/suppliers, just call me autistic, not retarded.

FYI: We know that those puts were owned by Melvin Capital based on 13F's [(see here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3gn91/people_pumping_gme_melvin_capital_management/) and presumably they also have an undeclared short position on GME.

**The open interest on GME 7/16 15p dropped from 54K to 6K last week.** They bought them in early October based on historical open interest / options volumes when the puts were over a $7/premium.

Even if they timed the exact bottom near $12, that's still around a **$25 million realized loss** from all the extrinsic value going to waste. The stock price started rallying up afterwards, so presumably they started covering their shorts too after unloading their puts?

I did a quick comparison of the Dot Com  Bubble vs the current "Bubble". In both instances we have a small bull  run, small correction (relatively speaking) and then a massive bull run.  In the 2000s I used 1500 as the baseline and 8000 as the current  baseline. The graph shows the Change in percent of the overall QQQ  Market leading up to the correction and into the subsequent market. They  are eerily similar. I would argue we are under performing the bull market of 1999 and have not reached the bull market of 2000. Based on  this, honestly, we may not see a huge correction until we hit Nasdaq 16K. It could even go to 24K?

I feel good about the next 6 months. After that its a toss up.    Of course I am not an expert so this is just hypothesizing...will  history repeat itself? What do you think?

The value of iron ore has soared over the past month, with benchmark spot prices climbing to a nine-year high of more than $160 a metric ton, as a resurgence in China’s economy coincides with constrained supply. Elevated prices have already prompted the association to call for government intervention. The Dalian exchange has toughened trading terms in an effort to rein in speculators.

Luo reiterated the group’s calls for setting up a new pricing mechanism for iron ore and improving the supervision of futures markets.

His view echoed a forecast by Mysteel on Friday that iron ore prices would peak during the first quarter next year before declining as overseas supply into China ramps up. The researcher estimated that the spot price may average $110 to $120 a metric ton in 2021, compared with $109 to $110 this year."

To recap, [OpenDoor is disrupting the $1.3 trillion dollar](https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-overview-investor-presentation.pdf) (annual) real estate market, with a leading market share in ibuying, and reducing a complex, tedious, and costly process to transact on a home to something simple, easy, and straightforward. The company will generate nearly $4B in revenue in 2021 after $2.5B in 2020. Not many flashy or disruptive SPAC combinations are already driving that much growth and proof of concept. This is a real company, not a story. 

With Carvana trading for 6x 2021 and Zillow trading for north of 6x 2021 revenue, that positions OpenDoor to land a $21B market cap, or roughly $40/share assuming it trades in line with its comps day one. With OpenDoor the clear leader with the best market position and technology, it arguably should get a premium - maybe $50-$60 a share or more. If people take a long term view that this should be a $100B company in 3-4 years (and much more long term), even greater potential remains.

Ticker change days have proven volatile for a number of SPACs. Most go down as many retail traders don't see the pop they were hoping for. Fortunately, IPOB is supported by Ark Funds (\~4MM share position), Fidelity, Soros, Sulvetta, and other nameplate institutions. Separately, the shares have consolidated and maintained gains vs. rocketing up just in the last few days - the fast money has been churned out. With the OpenDoor CEO ringing the bell of the NASDAQ, this will get as much visibility as a traditional IPO.

https://i.redd.it/f26g6oa95e661.gif_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Doortrash: DD on the Most Ridiculous IPO of 2020 ***TLDR For Those of You Who Can't Read:*** Doordash has been severely overvalued, taking advantage of COVID to IPO at all-time highs. They even admit to not being able to sustain their current revenue and costs in the future. Buy puts!

Positions: 1/15/21 120p, 2/19/21 120p

“Doordash is a technology company that connects people with the best in their cities.” -- [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com/about/)

Doordash has self-proclaimed itself as a tech company, and it seemingly has been able to receive a valuation indicating such. However, Doordash has found itself in the food delivery business, which is full of competition and little to no brand loyalty. This high level of competition makes it difficult to secure high margins and customers, both of which are required if $DASH ever hopes at becoming profitable. In fact, $DASH even says in their [S-1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-292381/), “We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future.”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v6lays45e661.jpg?width=490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74de7d1bec25abf5194cbe19fdf7e27121e979c1

Leading up to their IPO, $DASH faced several different valuations. First, their last private valuation ([Jun 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/doordash-scores-16-billion-valuation-now-top-of-food-delivery-chain.html)) placed them at $16 billion, which is reasonable, considering competitors GrubHub and Uber are valued at $7 billion and \~$11 billion respectively. This shows that even at the very height of the pandemic when revenue was highest and a quarterly profit was realized for the first time, investors only saw $DASH as a $16 billion company. However, when being [valued for an IPO](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/doordash-ipo-stock-offering-price-filing-dash-trading-debut-nyse-2020-12-1029875380?op=1) only 5 months later, $DASH was valued at $25 billion, then $29 billion, finally landing at an absurd $34 billion valuation, over double its value earlier in the year.

“Direct competitors, including Grubhub Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., and the recently acquired Postmates, are typically valued at three to six times sales, Citron said in a research report. DoorDash was trading at 19 times. However, accounting standards can vary from company to company.” -- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/08/doordashs-new-valuation-is-even-more-ridiculous/?sh=2cf1a243b348)

The madness does not stop there. On IPO day, $DASH ballooned to $180 and has yet to see a green day prior to Friday. One could argue that a profitable second quarter is bullish, as it shows that the company is finally turning a profit, but they immediately returned to operating on a loss in Q3, despite revenue being propped up temporarily due to an increase in demand for their services under quarantine.

There is no coincidence that Doordash filed for an IPO in a year that saw record-breaking revenue growth amid a pandemic, something that is unsustainable in the future. By filing at the peak of their growth, $DASH can take advantage of the hype surrounding food delivery before they face the reality of a COVID-free economy.  Overall, $DASH has been riding the hype train, and as things slow down, expect their stock price to follow.

I will probably be wrong in my speculation of amount of quarterly revenue needed to become profitable and I will probably be wrong in the value of the army contract. Reason why I set the flair as discussion. However, if you go through some of the sources I linked you might get similar numbers. 

Back on November 18th it was announced that Palantir🚀 was awarded one of two US army prototype contracts for capability set 23. Capability set 23 had 140 applications across 6 topics and was conducted as a "shark tank" style technical demonstration. For Palantir's🚀 topic I don't know how many competitors they had but they beat them and got one of two prototype contracts for network modernization.

We know that Palantir🚀 will achieve profitability soon. Accounting for the massive stock based compensation we had in Q3 and changing that back to the norm + projected increases in expenses for Q4, Palantir🚀 needs an estimated greater than +35.6M in revenue this upcoming quarter in order to turn profitable with at a 51% profit margin. The new 44M 3 year FDA contract already should account for 3.6M leaving us with \~32M (10% closer to profitability!!). Hopefully I am not too far off with my estimates. [PLTR Q3 Earnings](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=(NYSE%3A%20PLTR)%20reported%20its,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202020.&text=Our%20growth%20and%20momentum%20across,generated%20%24190.5%20million%20in%20revenue)

No value was given for the US Army Capability set 23 contract but from the budget listings and allocations to the capability set we can get a rough estimate as to how important this contract could be.

Going off of slide 14 from a US army budget presentation we see an interesting new item pertaining to a budget request for the 2021 year "software and digital technology":

[Source: https:\/\/www.asafm.army.mil\/Portals\/72\/Documents\/BudgetMaterial\/2021\/pbr\/Overview&#37;20and&#37;20Highlights\/Army\_FY\_2021\_Budget\_Overview.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/wm5lnm05fd661.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b263288b81f2609622fe656b9829d1d2ae5d5b6)

Or you could try playing around with some of the numbers on slide 14 from the source above; 4% allocation for intelligence x size of budget for each topic.

If my speculation is correct then in Q4 ER we have +25M (100M for the full year) putting us only at -7M away from profitability for the upcoming quarter! Meaning any new contracts whatsoever will send this past the moon🚀🚀🚀. Or I could just be really retarded and wasted a few hours of my day.

CVE-2020-13169 and CVE-2020-14005 **TLDR**

The first impact on VMware (VMW) was Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based hacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities explains persistence and how it was formed.

VMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)

Patches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.

**What is VMware?**

VMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. "VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security." -Forbes

**Who uses VMware?**

"More than 500,000 customers of all sizes have chosen VMware as their virtualization platform, including

• 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies  
• 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies  
• 100 percent of Fortune Global 100 companies • 99 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies"

VMware is also GSA approved and distributed through Dell (DELL), Carahsoft, and Ingram Micro/Promark and used by all levels of government and the US military.

[https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html)

**Who discovered the latest VMware vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities were disclosed to VMware by the NSA. VMware subsequently disclosed to the public.

**What was the major exploit within VMware products?**

"A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system."

[https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)

**How would someone be able to accomplish the exploit?**

You may be asking, how could someone accomplish a login to the administrative port of a VMware configuration with a valid password?

Well this is simple, SolarWinds Orion stores and utilizes the adequate credentials to monitor and maintain all devices placed within it's scope......including your VMware entities.

[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success\_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm)

**So the VMware has been compromised, what can they really do?**

Through VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager the actor is able to create unauthorized but VALID SAML tokens which enable authentication to network resources. Once an administrative level authentication is established to resources such as Active Directory the actor is able to create persistence.

"It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft’s best practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication"

[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA\_VMWARE%20ACCESS\_U\_OO\_195076\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)

**But did it really happen this way? Were the exploits chained?**

It seems so from all assessments. For all authenticators that could not be harvested from within SolarWinds, in the condition of existence of VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager served as the final hurdle to full domain control.

"The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victim’s on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources."

"In the first Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the actors compromise on-premises components of a federated SSO infrastructure and steal the credential or private key that is used to sign Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens (TA00061, T1552, T1552.004). Using the private keys, the actors then forge trusted authentication tokens to access cloud resources. A recent NSA Cybersecurity Advisory warned of actors exploiting a vulnerability in VMware Access®2 and VMware Identity Manager®3 that allowed them to perform this Tactics Techniques and Procedures and abuse federated SSO infrastructure"

"Regardless of how the initial on-premises compromise occurred, detecting authentication abuse can aid in detecting the compromise and even contain it if responded to quickly enough. The recent SolarWinds Orion®9 code compromise is one serious example of how on-premises systems can be compromised leading to abuse of federated authentication and malicious cloud access"

**Why would this shift VMware (VMW) stock price down if there is already a patch?**

VMware has gone from having patched an exploit disclosed to them by the NSA, to having been placed in the spotlight of previous and current utility by those that exploited the SolarWinds hack.

The NSA had already written very detailed documentation of how the VMware and SolarWinds exploits chained together but it had not proven digestible to most.

After Krebs wrote his article it brought up questions within consumers of VMware products of why they needed their version of identify as a service (IDaaS) for their single sign-on. This sentiment moved forward into investors and we saw a 5.6% drop in VMware (VMW) stock by end of day.

It is highly likely that as SolarWinds falls on news of the hack that now that VMware has been identified in the same exploit chain they may fall with it.

WMware thankfully were quick to disclose their own vulnerability, and none of their board attempted to exit their positions before that disclosure. This is the opposite of what had been done by SolarWinds, with whom they have now been linked by technical means.

We may see a further fall in VMware stock price on Monday and throughout the upcoming weeks as a result of the above information.

What would you guys consider to be potential obstacles/walls that would hinder the offering when it eventually comes along?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A WSB'rs Guide To Stimulus Negotiations _tl;dr Money printer no longer go brrrrrr, money printer never really went brrrrr_

The news on early Sunday morning is that boomer Senator Pat Toomey is [turning off the money printer](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-democrats-reach-compromise-over-covid-19-stimulus-package-n1251837) so that it no longer goes brrrr:

> “This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by Dec. 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval," Toomey spokesperson Steve Kelly said.

So money printer no longer go brr? On fuck! This is the worst news since November when [Mnuchen asked the money printer to stop brrrrrrring!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) Remember what happened after that news? Markets tanked, the EV bubble popped, bears came out of hibernation and the crimson blood of bulls everywhere ran though the gutters.

Oh wait no the exact opposite happened. After markets threw a minor tantrum, and then TSLA got included and SPY went to ATH. This all the while [main street businesses got shafted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) as Mnuchin counted on the program expiring at the end of the year, a thing that has now come to pass. So effectively we're looking at a January that'll have the same fundamentals as November/December.

What did Democrats get out of this? Essentially they got Toomey to drop a provision he wanted that would write into law that these programs would never be used again. That means that if the Senate thinks there is value in restarting the money printer, they can. They just have to vote on it like they did with CARES. Ultimately the money printer was way more valuable as an idea than it was as an actual printer, since most of the [loan programs](https://www.accountable.us/news/breaking-new-congressional-report-slams-main-street-lending-program/) were not that effective in practice. After all, there is a reason they're able to return $429 billion of the $500 billion they've been allocated, they weren't able to find a home for it.

Meanwhile, all you degenerates will get another $600 to buy your fractional $TSLA shares and continue pumping. Plus whatever "stimulus failure" was priced in is now off the table. In case it's not clear, I'm bullish on this news, and anyone shorting the market because some difunctional programs are off the table must be be dysfunctional themselves.

And fuck you to the gay bears._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Interesting Squeeze Facts & Market Cap & Future Valuations GME currently sits at a market cap of roughly $1 Billion. ATH was ~$9B cap back in 2007/2008 and a less high ~$6,5B cap in 2013. This would put share price today at $130 and $95 respectively, with the shares outstanding that GameStop currently has (69.75 million). 

For the share price to reach $1000 would "only" take a $70B market cap. For reference, other companies with such a market cap include: CSX, CB, BDX, LRCX
Don't know who they are? Neither do I. Boomer companies with large caps.

For a more conservative example, how would a $500 price valuation ($35B cap) look like compared to others in that range? SYY (food distribution), CMG (Chipotle), F (Ford) and EBAY (eBay).

Even comparing to Best Buy ($26B market cap) would already raise share price to $370

If Cohen does a complete turnaround for GameStop and makes it a household name in the gaming industry (something like Steam but EVERYTHING gaming related) then I can see $500 becoming pretty reasonable (might even be low-balling it). However even if he takes over that would be mid- to long-term valuations since it would take quite a bit of work to pull off all the changes. So what are we banking on right now? The positive earnings for Q4 + maybe some Cohen news to get the ball rolling to tendie land and maybe a mild short squeeze to help.

Perhaps. Or maybe there's still *some* chance for an infinity squeeze if MM uses logic.

With the current share price, for Boomer Sherman & Co to issue the shelf order, it would dilute the shares with an additional 6-7 million shares (to get the $100 million worth). However what if they waited for the share to reach obscene heights (say $1000) they would reach their $100 million with only 100k shares. Thus very minimal dilution would occur.

Obviously this has a lot of speculation in it, so don't take what I said too seriously. I mainly wrote this down so I can visualize it better for myself and confirm my own bias that GME is going to the moon.

Oh and fun fact; according to the ownership list for WSB, we own approximately 3.8 Million shares of GameStop, 5.8% or ~$57 million worth of GME (soon to be Billions). 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does anyone else like to get in and out of options on TSLA close to every minute?

Or you can always ignore them and YOLO 50k and short Coca-Cola :)

Anyway, here comes the analysis: market closed the 19th of December with a bearish candle formation, that doesn't mean that the price will necessarily go down, it always can happen that 1.7 million of people get into Robinhood and buy NIO stocks. EMA doesn't look promising, we might see it go down to the 0.236 Fibonacci level for support, that's also where it'll find the EMA as support too. RSI shows that the stock price is correct, closer to overbought than oversold, but that's fine. It also crossed the resistance it had showing the down trend before the 15th of December, which indicates overall bullishness of the new trend. It looks like a good buy and hold for some days at least, wait to buy at the 0.236 Fib level, that should be 45.7 per share

Good luck and happy YOLO trading ;)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who want's to be my partner? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A POTENTIAL catalyst for GME's brick @ mortar business? Let me preface this by saying I'm a slightly more enlightened, poor retard at best, so take everything I say with a grain of salt, as it may all be just a figment of my imagination.

I recently built a new PC for myself to edit my YouTube videos and play some Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 (what a shitshow by the way...) and I've been made aware of the scalping problem. Basically, you have these opportunists who buy dozens, hundreds of new graphics cards, processors and, more recently, gaming consoles. Then they resell them on Ebay, Craiglist or other bidding/advert sites for 50%, 100% or even more profit compared to what they paid for. The reason why they can do that is due to the pandemic, lockdowns and above-average demand for this type of hardware due to boredom or newfound interest in tech and gaming. Obviously, scalping then creates a short-term shortage, worldwide, or it forces people to postpone buying new hardware due to unwillingness to pay way more than the retail price.

It's nothing new, basic principle of supply, demand, all that fancy shit...

Now, one possible way to prevent that right now would be to NOT offer this hardware for sale online, at all, at least until the supply catches up with demand, or demand dies down.

GameStop already has a network of brick & mortar stores that can offer this new "service". In other words, the management can simply announce something like "Look, we all know scalping is a problem, so in the interest of preventing that from happening, or at least minimizing it, we will only be selling AMD's CPUs and GPUs, Nvidia GPUs, Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in our physical store locations until worldwide availability of this hardware stops being an issue." Obviously, not in those exact words, it needs to be more pretty and Public Relations-y and whatnot, but you get the point... There is the factor of pandemic and exposing more people to more people, but you just address that by clearly communicating "6 feet distance between people, no more than X amount of people allowed in store, you will get you chance to buy the console you want to buy your kid for Christmas..." blabblahblahblah...

We've already seen them attempt something like that with that last minute announcement of brand new batch of consoles, but that was as sloppy as you would expect from a boomer management who has sticks up their asses and causes a massive shitshow with a move like that. It can be done way more elegantly and transparently, communicated clearly to the audience of potential buyers without causing a PR debacle.

If they could just see an opportunity in this and announce it clearly to a wider gaming community, they could even use this to dip further into PC hardware as a perfect way to expand their reach in that sector.

I don't have high hopes for something like that happening, you 'Muricans be stoopid like that (jokes, I love you!) but on the off chance a GME employee or a mid-level manager reads this, I'd say you should consider telling this to your superiors, because opportunities come and go, you have to act on them swiftly.

Let’s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ 

For all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor’s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday’s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ 

The committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what’s hot and eliminates from its august roster what’s not. 3/ 

It’s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ 

Pull up the long-term charts to see how these “timely” additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ 

Yahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ 

The company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ 

The stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn’t high point for another month. 8/ 

Yahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn’t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ 

In hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¾ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ 

At the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ 

But the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ 

Heck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to “only” 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ 

Sales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ 

Yahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ 

The buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I’d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ 

At its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ 

Had Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ 

Qualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ 

Never has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ 

Of course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that’s not what counts in the passive index. It’s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ 

Tesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to “earn” a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ 

Impressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ 

On November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ 

The gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world’s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla’s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ 

The share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ 

Let’s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ 

25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota’s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft’s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ 

80% of Tesla’s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ 

The stock will come in at \~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ 

What prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ 

At “only” 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ 

For grins let’s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \~3%, Toyota \~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I’d bet heavily against. 33/ 

At the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today’s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ 

To finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ 

Car companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are "assuming" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ 

The best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling “at-the-market” blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today’s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ 

Through the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ 

So far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B “at-the-market”). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn’t come from profit or free cash. 39/ 

Total capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ 

From a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn’t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ 

Our example has Tesla’s market cap growing over the next decade at “only” 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don’t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ 

Toyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ 

Auto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \~3% net margins and earn that same \~3% on capital and revenues grow at \~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that’s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ 

The best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won’t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it’s a CAR company. 45/ 

If it earns Toyota’s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software “upgrades,” it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ 

The realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ 

Ask the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid “break” here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can "volunteer their time" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won’t roll over and play dead. 48/ 

My prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he’d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won’t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ 

That leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ 

By contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he’d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company’s shares. If the auto makers won’t take them in a deal, and they shouldn’t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ 

We’ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla’s shares from here should be considered a “fee,” or a tax on stupidity. 52/ 

At 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to….where Tesla’s shares began the year. 53/ 

A 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ 

You can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today’s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ 

Bravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to “invest” 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, “Come Monday, it’ll be all right...” 56/ 

As disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don’t take this note as investment advice because it’s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ 

If Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that’s 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END

TL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!

TL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P. Tesla can fail, or maybe not.

# LiDAR and Future Market Share

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ztmi5ayc58661.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1aaf5f9f0d51d577acf329bc463546537cfbc9

The global LiDAR market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2% from 2019 to 2027 to reach USD 3.6 billion by 2027.^(1) It can be hard to determine if this is an accurate projection as we have been living in a time period of exponential growth in various markets. The profitability of LAZR in this time period will also be determined by what percent of the LiDAR market they can secure for production. What we do know now is LAZR is producing proprietary LiDAR systems that outpace their competitors, and have a faster production timeline (2022 vs. Velodyne’s 2025 target).

>*“We have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage,” Russell said. “We’ve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other LiDAR R&D efforts combined.”* ^(2)

You can view Luminar’s patents here: [**https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies**](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies)

# Competitors

“The various competitors prevalent in the market are challenged to provide innovative offerings, which help consumers, address changing technologies, business practices, and security needs. A large number of notable players are based in Europe and are involved in offering advanced solutions for meeting the requirements across varied applications.

>*The current market environment is witnessing intense competition between the key players for achieving market domination via enhancement of quality and product differentiation, thereby enabling the growing market consolidation through strategic initiatives such as alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Industry participants have entered into strategic partnerships with suppliers and distributors to strengthen their product portfolio and geographical presence.* ^(1)

We can see LAZR is a heavy hitter right off the bat. They’ve been public for a year and a half and have already made several big moves in that time, the oldest being their transportation industry partners and more recently their deal with Mobileye. Their transition into public trading on Dec. 3rd showed the potential for this company as investors tripled the stock price.

# Current deals

* LiDAR production for Mobileye (a division of Intel)
* LiDAR production for Volvo fully autonomous driving

# Current speculation

After Citron’s hit job (fuck you Citron) analysts have upgraded LAZR for a **$41 price target**. Read more here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html)

# Product analysis

I’m no scientist, however LAZR’s LiDAR systems are supposedly more accurate and have longer visible range and response/processing time than their competitors. Read more here: [https://www.luminartech.com/technology/](https://www.luminartech.com/technology/)

# Future announcements

I discussed this a bit in my last post but this is what I’m personally focused on. [https://patents.google.com/patent/US8760499B2/en?q=A+method+for+remotely+powering&assignee=Luminar+Technologies&oq=assignee:(Luminar+Technologies)+A+method+for+remotely+powering](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8760499B2/en?q=A+method+for+remotely+powering&assignee=Luminar+Technologies&oq=assignee:(Luminar+Technologies)+A+method+for+remotely+powering)

This patent outlines a few key components we may very well see in the next decade (technology that LAZR’s founder Austin Russell designed himself):

* **Personalized ads** on billboards/other surfaces via projection as your car is autonomously driven
* Remote car charging

I have grander theories but I tried to keep this analysis tame and restrained (unlike my positions LOL)

TL;DR I’m not gonna tell you what to buy. Do your own research first!
