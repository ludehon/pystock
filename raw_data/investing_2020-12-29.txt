\- First of all, this company is a COVID mutation stock similar to ABCL (the catch: ABCL is a 10 billion dollar company and IPA is a 300 million dollar company) Their cocktail therapy approach is designed to be effective against more than one virus strain.

\- Even without the COVID therapy, this company is generating revenue through its CRO lab research services which are growing at 50% yoy, with beautiful margins and a positive EBITDA. Just reported a 4.7m rev quarter with 700k ebitda.

\- EXTREMELY low float. insiders have 1.5m shares. if we subtract that from the outstanding its about 15m shares. Uplist will allow IPA to find more institutional investors and lock up the float even more. Barely any warrants outstanding as welll. this company is looking to raise money at a much higher market cap, with institutional investors likely as part of the raise. with this kind of float a few whales buying will make this stock explode

\- Solid balance sheet with 17m of cash and barely any debt

We all know the time-proven benefits of strict whole-market index investing, meaning VTI or at the very least another big index like SP500 or even the Nasdaq. Stock-pickers are at serious risk of performing worse than the indexes.

However, this made me think of something else - with the popularity of ETF's, how would you say "ETF shopping" compares to stock picking and index investing? Clearly it has to be less riskier than stock picking, but how much more risk are you taking on compared to VTI / SP500?

By ETF shopping I mean people finding about things like the TAN ETF (oohh solar is nice, I want that!), then hearing about ARKK, getting a piece and OHHH there is ARKG too, I mean yeah sure genomic revolution I can't miss out on that! People are saying Uranium is coming back, so how about the URA ETF? And Gaming / esports, gotta have that! (This may have been me at some point.)

I've been thinking about this a fair bit, and the way I see it, there are just many, many wonderful ETF's out there and if you choose reputable ones, you can go on quite the shopping spree and still expect wonderful returns if you get even half or most of the megatrends correct at all and the rest do ok, matching market or underperforming slightly. Rather than picking 7-10 stocks to go in on for life, I might choose my handful of ETF's instead. With some of the ideas I have, I kind of expect to beat the market, I love all of my picks.

So, TL;DR, how much increased risk do you see in this megatrend ETF shopping style?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR 2021 Outlook. https://investorplace.com/2020/12/palantir-technologies-beware-what-february-brings-for-pltr-stock/

🚀 **$PSTH – Activist Investor Bill Ackman’s Gigantic SPAC – Updated DD** 🚀

I last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.

Since then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.

**TLDR;**

PSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath's largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a “mature unicorn”. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.

**Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:**

Two aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I've engaged with enough of them online to know):

**1)** Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)

**AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.**

**THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.**

**\*\*\*Another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.**

**For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.**

**2)** The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.

**Background information and recent events**

· In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman’s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.

· In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:

o He is hunting for a “mature unicorn” - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but "mature" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of Billions.

o He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth

o This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he's also friendly to a FINTECH

o He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.

**o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**

Lisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News

Michael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company

Jackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company

Joseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.

**\*\*We don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives\*\***

o He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far

o **Investors in the SPAC so far include:**

§ Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, “the next Buffet” and noted value investor) = $450M position

§ Guggenheim Capital = $560M position

§ Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position

§ Soroban Capital = $290M position

§ Wells Fargo = $290M position

§ Kevin “Sharktank” O’Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1

§ **Warren Buffet’s** position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.

**§ KEY Point: \*\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\*\***

o The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).

**PSTH SPAC Design**

· PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:

· PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique “tontine” structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the "tontine" name - look it up, pretty cool.

**Targets**

Much speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:

· Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.

· Since that interview, Air B&B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO

**· Stripe has generated intense interest online.** Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that “no such deal” had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother’s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by [u/YoloCapitalMgmt](https://www.reddit.com/u/YoloCapitalMgmt/) on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).

**· Bloomberg remains in play.** There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.

· Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.

**Target summary based on my view**

Targets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement

1. Bloomberg
2. Stripe
3. Fidelity

**Bill Ackman**

A few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:

· A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you’re interested in looking into it.

· He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.

· In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.

· Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific

· Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).

**Some other notes**

This is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.

While this isn’t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.

Fellow investors! 

I’m looking for opinions on the investment opportunity I just took on. I’ll first start off with some basics, I’m 31 with no kids and fairly successful in real estate. I’ve been wanting to build a portfolio of investment properties that can generate a decent amount of passive income. With me being in the business, I know the market pretty damn good at least in my area. My goal was to pay cash for a few more come spring.

However- I was approached to buy into a pretty notable business. $50,000 at 5% a year. It’s already established with a well put together operations agreement. Profits this year were just over $120,000. I would be the 4th and last partner. The contract is good through 2035. 

My question is- What do you think is a good ROI per year? I am such a sissy when it comes to long term investing. I figured if I’m bringing in at least $8,500 per year (the business will continue to grow of course) it’s a smart move. I sign the agreement tomorrow and hand over the check. Hilarious that I’m reaching out through Reddit on a $50,000 dollar purchase but I know it’s the place to go for honest input. 

Cheers my friends!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Firearms as investments. I collect military surplus, and have seen wild increases on prices on pieces i own in my own collection. 

There is a supply factor. Cant make new ones so fixed supply. 

They come in cycles. Importers get a ton, sell cheap, supply dries up, and the prices rise. Im looking at purchases from my last ten years (but majority over last 5.)

Going through local stores and gunbroker vs my own receipts, ive found stuff like this:

Got a mosin 91/30, used to be 100 bucks and by the crate, now go for 250 local. More than doubled value. 

mosin m44. got one for 240. Locally they sell for 400.

Nagant 1895 revovler. Bought for 100. now sell for 330-350.

Romainian tokarev, bought for 200, now command 300. 

&#x200B;

Wondering, is it a coherent investing strategy to buy some surplus when it comes in in bulk for future resale? 

If id bought 10 nagant revovlers at 100 a piece and resold for 330, id have 3300 dollars for 2300 in profit. 

Plus i can fit those in a couple of shoe boxes.

Based on MPs 8-K, they currently only realize $3.74/kg for their Rare Earth Ore (REO). 
https://i.imgur.com/3yk0nlM.jpg

$3393/907kg is $3.74 per kg

This is the current price of Neodymium:
https://i.imgur.com/ymElv6u.jpg
It’s in CNY:

607500 CNY for 1 ton
1 usd is 6.53CNY
1 ton is 907kg

This comes out to $103 USD per kg at today’s prices.

This is a revenue multiplier that is going to be HUGE for MP once they have  processing capabilities in 2023.

I realize that there will be loss in processing, but they are also not yet at capacity. Plus the increased demand of neodymium magnets for EVs.

Look at the rise of neodymium price this year (chart above). The demand is so high, China is buying literally all of MPs REO because they can’t keep up with the demand. 

This is the estimates EV demand in the coming decade:

It’s scary thinking about how much the price of neodymium will rise based on this demand. 

MP is currently profitable, they have the funds to finish the processing plant, plus they have government backing.

I wrote my thesis on how macroeconomic policy affects US equity markets (equity markets = stock market). I've spent the last 3 years studying this stuff and I'd say that I am not qualified in any sense to give sound investment advice. What that should tell you is that the stock market is an extremely complex landscape and takes years to understand. Even the best of the best lose money. With that being said, this comment is for informational purposes and not to be taken as investment advice or direction.

&#x200B;

I originally wrote this post as a comment to another user, but thought that it may be beneficial for others to use. It's very surface level, but I think it does a good job of answering some more abstract questions that people may have about equity markets. I also think it does a good job of establishing a solid, albeit basic idea of value investing and financial analysis.

\---

Understand that the last ten years does not accurately represent equity markets historically. From 1925 to 1941, if you invested in the S&P 500 index, you would have seen an average annual return of less than 5% with several of those years being negative- over the next ten years. Same goes for 1960 to 1975. (Disclaimer: Before people tear me apart saying you can't invest in the S&P 500 directly, I know. I'm using it as an example.)

&#x200B;

We've experienced a remarkably strong bull market over the last ten years, with 20% annual returns on the S&P 500 index; however, just because we've had a strong market the last ten years does not mean it will stay that way. Consider Japan in the early 1990s. Their bull market turned into a bubble (google: financial bubble) and for the next 10 years they saw no long term growth in their equity markets. They call the 1990s in Japan, "the lost decade". So this begs the question: if there are 10, sometimes 15 year long periods where we have almost no growth, or perhaps negative returns, when, where, and why should I park my money in equities?

&#x200B;

The first thing I think we should understand is **risk**. Risk is at the heart of almost all things "investing". If you go to the casino, and place $5,000 straight at the roulette table, your payout is a massive 35:1. If your bet hits, you walk away with $180,000. But statistically, your chances of winning are less than 3%. The risk is massive. Alternatively, if you buy a 3-month US treasury bill, the payout is around .1%. Meaning you would made $5 on a $5,000 investment. Why? The risk is so low. Also, what is a 3-month US treasury bill? Let me explain.

&#x200B;

A US Treasury bill is a short-term government debt security. Here's how it works. You give the US government $5,000. They now owe you $5,000 PLUS interest at a future date. In this example, it's 3 months. The US government says, "Thank you! We will give you $5,005 back in three months!" In three months, they give you the money back. Ask yourself, if you had to guess the percentage likelihood of the US government collapsing in the next three months, what would it be? Pretty low, right? That's why the return is so low. The United States government has the power, means, right, and infrastructure to tax the wealthiest population on the planet. Also, they aren't going out of business anytime soon. Therefore, that $5 return on a $5,000 investment is essentially guaranteed. [Check out this chart.](https://www.ngpf.org/blog/investing/chart-explaining-investing-concept-risk-return/)

&#x200B;

All stocks sit somewhere on this line of risk and return. But, how do we know the risk and return? Great question. How do we assess the value of an asset? An asset's worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today's dollars. Read that again. An asset's worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today's dollars. This is what we call "Net Present Value". [Here's a video over it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-lN5xORIwc) [Here's the NPV formula.](https://www.educba.com/net-present-value-formula/)

&#x200B;

Let's say we have a machine that spits out one dollar every year for 5 years. What is the value of that machine assuming a 2% inflation rate every year? Let's find out! Remember our NPV formula? Let's do the math. \[$1 / (1+ .02)1\] + \[$1 / (1+ .02)2\]+ ... + \[$1 / (1+ .02)5\] = $4.71. In this example, inflation rate is the discount rate; however, the discount rate can be many other things. We won't go into that right now though.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean to you? It gives you perspective. All those price movements in the stock market are the product of huge investment banks, mutual funds, and hedge funds moving money in and out of equities in massive quantities, with those decisions backed by hundreds, if not thousands of hours of research with private data that you can't access even if you had the money too.

&#x200B;

One of the big ways they (big banks) make these decisions is by using the NPV formula with Net Income in the numerator to determine the value of the asset and a rate to discount the cash flows at (there are ways to do this, again, we won't go into it). Then they use more complex methods to assess risk. Other methods of valuation may be used, but again, this is one of the big ones.

&#x200B;

So far, we've learned that risk and reward are positively correlated and companies are valued by their earnings. But, if companies are valued by their earnings, then why do bubbles happen? Why does the market tank sometimes? Shouldn't the market accurately reflect all companies at any given time? In theory, yes. But humans are irrational creatures, and often wrong. Therefore, stock prices are not always appropriately valued.

&#x200B;

I am going to introduce you to two financial ratios: earnings per share (EPS) and price to earnings (P/E) ratio. NOTE: EARNINGS = NET INCOME.

&#x200B;

Earnings per share is the net income of a company divided by it's number of outstanding shares. EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding. So let's say my company has a net income of $100 for the 2020 year and there are 100 shares outstanding. That would mean that my company's EPS is $1. Let's look at a real example: Apple. [Click on this link.](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019320000096/aapl-20200926.htm) In the top left hand corner, click on sections>financial statements>consolidated statements of operations. Find EPS. Apple's EPS is 3.31. That's pretty solid. EPS puts a companies earnings in perspective with respect to the number of shareholders it has, which allows you to compare a companies earnings to its competitors, whether they be smaller or larger.

&#x200B;

Next, the price to earnings ratio. This is easy to calculate. It is just the share price divided by the EPS. PE = Price / EPS. What this does is puts the price of the stock in perspective with respect to its earnings. Consider the example where my company had an EPS of $1. Let's say the price of my stock is $30 per share. That would mean my PE ratio is 30 (PE raio of 30 = $30/$1 EPS). For some perspective on the PE ratio- the average P/E ratio in the S&P 500 is 25-30. But they can be as high as 1,000 (like Tesla) or as low 4 or 5. What the PE ratio does is says, "Hey man, here's a metric to determine how justifiable the price of this stock is considering how much the company makes." Generally speaking, investing in companies that have low PE ratios tend to show higher returns. Why? Because there is more of an acceptable margin (historically) for the price to increase with respect to earnings.

&#x200B;

For example: Five years ago, Apple's PE ratio was around 10. Now it's 40. This means the price went up, the earnings went down, or both. Over the last 5 years, Apple's EPS has increased. Therefore, because it's PE ratio is increasing as well, this means that it's price of the stock is increasing faster than it's earnings. [Reference this chart.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that the big boys like Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc. think that Apple is going to do really well over the coming years as of right now. But let's say that tomorrow Apple was outed as a front for a money laundering scheme and they were going to be audited by the SEC and FBI. The price would tank. Why? Because people would be questioning if Apple would even exist as a company in the following years. **They (the big boys, the government, me and you) would doubt their earnings.** Rightfully so, I should add.

&#x200B;

What I (and many others) do is look at companies and determine:

&#x200B;

1. Are their earnings sound? (Is it positive? If not, will it be positive? Will the company grow? Will another company come in and do whatever this company is doing, better?) This will help you determine if the return will be solid.
2. What is the current price of the equity in relation to the earnings? (What's the PE? Is it going up? Is it going down? Why?) This will help you determine how risky is your investment.

&#x200B;

A solid company is generally one that has a high EPS, a low PE ratio, and is expected to grow. The reason Tesla has a PE ratio of >1,000 is because people expect it to grow. Like, they expect it to be the largest electric vehicle company by net income in the next 10-20 years AND expand into other markets like solar energy and batteries. Will they be right? I guess we'll see!

&#x200B;

This is the tip of the ice berg when it comes to investing. If you truly want to learn how to capture returns without exposing your investment to a large amount of risk, you are going to have to spend time learning how to do this. Here are some resources:

&#x200B;

* The Intelligent Investor (with Commentary) by Benjamin Graham. Read it entirely, the commentary first, then the chapters (Commentary, chapter, commentary, chapter, ...). Then read the commentary again and make notes.
* Learn how to read three financial statements: The balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows.
* Watch Martin Shkreli's investing lessons on Youtube. Specifically the first 5 or 6. Yes, he's done some bad stuff. But he really is an excellent teacher and extremely smart.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, experience is a great teacher. Play with a small amount of money. Throw $100 at a stock you like and see what happens to it. If it drops 10% in a day, figure out why. If it goes up 10% in a day, figure out why. If it goes up steadily over the next six months, figure out why. If it doesn't do anything- figure out why.

&#x200B;

I'd like to note again that these opinions do not constitute investment advice. They are my personal opinions and do not guarantee any sort of returns. This is how I personally approach the stock market. Investing in any asset carries risk and all investors should conduct their own due diligence and analysis before investing.

Do you think a company curing blindness could be a good investment?

I certainly do.

Well.

**Here's my DD. Hope you enjoy it.**

Biopharma stocks are for sure wild-catalyst-induced stocks. You can check by yourselves anytime. Moderna was at 54$ when I first went in (september)... and after a few "bad" news affecting one of the other COVID vaccines made it rise to 160$ in a couple of months. Cassava Sciences, developing drugs against Alzheimer Disease, jumped from 3$ to 12$ in a couple of weeks (mostly in 2-3 days), just because early clinical trials showed some mildly promising data. Ocugen, producing gene therapy for rare ocular diseases, went from 0.29$ to 2.60$ in 2 days (yep, that's a neat x9 in 2 fuckin days). This quick-catalyst-induced-increase may be seen in almost any biopharma stock which is working on a needed drug, just after the moment they release some news about it.

**And it may become extreme if at least 1 of these 3 conditions is present:**

\- The drug is designed to treat a serious disease (like COVID, Alzheimer or Blindness in those examples).

\- The drug is designed to treat a prevalent (frequent) disease (like COVID and Alzheimer in those examples).

\- Theres no existing treatment for that condition (like in all those 3 examples).

Imagine what could happen if those 3 conditions coexist.

Exactly.

Now you have some examples about what is this about, but you can google more of them anytime, as this happens almost each week, after each medical congress, minutes after clinical trial results are released. It happens so fast that, unless you have insider information, there's no way to anticipate it. Biopharma companies, in order to avoid wild stock price fluctuations, present those news outside market hours, via press releases or via medical congresses (which take place mostly at weekends). Until then, they keep strict secret about how those drugs are doing in the research groups, and theres nothing we can do to change that. But for the medical trained eye, it's possible to read between lines.

&#x200B;

**By now, Im pretty sure the only thing you want to know is "what's the play about".**

It's time to introduce myself. First of all, sorry for my english. It's not my mothertongue.

I am a public+private practice ophthalmologist specialized in retina and glaucoma, scientific researcher too, with a growing interest in stocks. Im not Michael Burry (a physician too) but I could have fixed that eye of his.

I won't make you lose more time.

The stock I'm talking about is **Iveric Bio** (**$ISEE**, a well chosen ticker), an ophthalmology fight-against-blindness drug developer. The drug it's called "avacincaptad pegol", AKA **Zimura®**. The disease we're treating is **"Age-Related Macular Degeneration" (AMD)** (pretty sure most of you had already heard about it).

**AMD** is a **VERY SERIOUS** and **VERY PREVALENT** eye disease, leading cause of vision loss worldwide, for which **THERE'S NO SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT.** Yes, the 3 conditions we need for a drug to make your favourite biopharma stock rise like hell -insert doom-BFGdivision.mp3- are present here, in Iveric Bio's Zimura®).

^(\* Actually, to be as accurate as possible, AMD don't leads to complete blindness. At it's final stage, you still keep your peripheral vision (pretty useless for day to day life, but you end up ruined, as you lose the central (really important) vision. You can't read. You can't drive. You can't watch tv, paint, write, or even see the face of your grandchildren. So you, in fact, are practical and legally blind.)

**To the date, AMD DOES NOT HAVE ANY USEFUL TREATMENT**. It's a progressive, unstoppable, degenerative disease which may present as soon as 50yo and that leads, within months-years, to the irreversible atrophy of the central portion of the retina (neurosensorial tissue responsible of converting light entering your eye into nerve impulses your brain interprets). We ophthalmologists recommend some lifestyle and dietetic measures to these patients, which have shown a very mild effect on delaying disease progression (and even around that, biopharma industry has created a billionare vitamin-selling business). The only "real" treatment we actually prescribe for AMD is the 2-3 available antiVEGF drugs that may be injected in the eye when AMD turns from a dry presentation (the most common by far) to a wet presentation (a more rare complicated form of the dry one). I will talk about those injections and the $$$$$ they print for the industry... later.

Now, if you want to check this information, feel free to do it. You may easily google all this, but I will try to help. Here you have some official patient-friendly sources:

**Now, what's doing Iveric Bio to fight this?**

They've successfully developed a innovative drug, Zimura®, which proved to significantly reduce retinal atrophy progression in AMD, main cause of the vision loss it induces. We're not talking about an early "proof of concept" trial. We're not even talking about a phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trial, looking for clinical activity of the drug or its correct dossage. No. We're saying that in August 2020, Iveric Bio already published GATHER 1, a Phase 3 (ultimate clinical trial before drug commercial release) proving the safety and effectiveness of Zimura® treating AMD. And they did it at "Ophthalmology", the official journal from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the most respected and highest impact factor ophthalmology scientific journal worldwide. Since then, with normal fluctuations, Iveric Bio has been experimenting a gradual organic healthy stock price rising (doubling share price)... preparing for the final catalyst... the publication of GATHER 2, which for sure will confirm the data and work as a fast-key for FDA and EMA approval, opening a billionaire massive unexplored drug selling business worldwide.

Here you have the full Ophthalmology article:

[https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420%2820%2930845-9/fulltext?dgcid=raven\_jbs\_aip\_email](https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420%2820%2930845-9/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email)

And the plans the company has: [https://investors.ivericbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iveric-bio-announces-publication-gather1-phase-3-clinical-trial](https://investors.ivericbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iveric-bio-announces-publication-gather1-phase-3-clinical-trial)

You may have noticed that GATHER 2 is a 12-month clinical trial. Well. They're already recruiting. And that will be the final catalyst, which will make $ISEE become a 100-200$/share company (like those which now sell the antiVEGF used for that rare AMD wet form, or probably even bigger)... but it will keep rising till then. Here we have a short-term and long-term play. I recommend you to hold till then (I will), but you can easily double your money in the next weeks-months, since they're releasing positive data almost monthly. It's a safe investment. $ISEE is breaking it's resistance level monthly and all analysts set it's real price at 13$, agreeing it's outperforming. If that's not attractive enough, stock it's going through a dip right now, it's at support level, so it's the perfect moment to go in. I've just increased my number of shares (2000 by now).

Please notice Zimura® works for ALL kinds of AMD (dry and wet) and even for other retinal diseases as Stargardt Disease. AntiVEGF only work for the wet rare form of AMD and despite that, it had become, in the last years, a billionare profitable business, supporting huge companies like Bayer or Novartis.

Please read the last paragraph: [https://eyewire.news/articles/market-scope-novartis-leads-the-race-to-launch-a-new-anti-vegf-for-wet-amd/](https://eyewire.news/articles/market-scope-novartis-leads-the-race-to-launch-a-new-anti-vegf-for-wet-amd/) **AntiVEGF make $17 billion a year, and they're treating just a rare form of AMD. Zimura® treats all kinds of AMD and, to top, it may be used in combination with antiVEGF in the same injection, so the growth possibilities are infallible.**

To add: all ophthalmology services, public or private, have radically changed in the last years due to this new eye injection reality. Since antiVEGF became available, we had the ethic obligation of injecting them to wet AMD patients, repeating dose almost monthly (at a price of +900 euro per injection... in Spain... probably much more in USA). Hospitals have hired more ophthalmologists and built more surgical rooms to face this massive wave of millions of patients needing injections for AMD continually. Almost 60% of our daily work now revolves around injecting those drugs. So, when Zimura® gets finally released, the setup is already perfect. The logistics and infraestructure for massive eye injections are already here. The new so-needed drug will be prescribed and selled in an explosive way.

PS: for those of you wanting the "purely financial DD" of Iveric Bio: x3 share price in the last 9 months and x2 in the last 3 months. Sure you can see a trend there. Slightly negative-frozen earnings as it's the rule in "research stocks" before they get FDA approval and start selling the product.... but a market cap of 600m. CEO and the board: serious people with wide experience in the biopharma field. Company has other promising drugs on pipeline besides Zimura®.

**TL;DR: Iveric Bio little-known stock releasing blind-preventing-world-changing drug in 1-2 years. Price rising steadily but quickly as Wall Street realizes what's coming with this company. Rising share price in an organic healthy way due to frequent positive press releases, mid-clinical trial data release, presentations at healthcare conferences (next one January 14th). Expecting a huge increase in the mid-term. I recommend buying the little correction dip now or regreting later.**

The streaming industry is getting a lot of exposure lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max. Looking for a pure play in the streaming service I came across CuriosityStream. Basically the platform offers documentaries about science, history, politics, etc...  and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform. The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3 was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber base comes from bundled packages at a heavy discount. They are looking for exposure while growing at all costs. Here are some key point:

&#x200B;

* The company has no debt and $180M cash in the balance sheet.
* **The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions  in Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020**
* Over 60% gross margin
* They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market environment it seems pretty safe to buy something that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting an industry, targeting a more sophisticated  customers instead of the average becky who likes stranger things. The last time John Hendricks created something (Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a $32B company before stepping down and creating CuriosityStream.

I'm trying to research shares and the ones listen on [investing.com](https://investing.com) a table, split into time frames of 5 mins, 15mins, hourly, daily, monthly with either buy, strong buy, sell or strong sell under each. I'm confused what these mean. My guess is that using historical data they are trying to predict if in the next 5 mins or 15 mins it's likely to go up or down and therefore you can weigh up an immediate purchase. But non specific timeframes of 'hourly, daily, monthly' has that theory a bit dashed. Any ideas? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think Facebook is ridiculously undervalued Big fan of Peter lynch and the concept of uncomplicated investment strategies. Like Mr Lynch, I don't pay much attention to extra technical analysis.

So For me, when making big bulk (no yolo) investments, I only focus on a few things: 

* **Profitable?** (Yes , Margins? - Mid-HIGH %)
* **Debt?** (Preferably NO, or Yes, but with 2x cash to pay it off)
* **Competition?** (Yes, but market leader or top player) 
* **Growth ?** (Yes, more growth potential) 

To me, a company that fits this criteria will get into my portfolio and I'll adjust as i see fit on a YoY basis. 

This brings me to facebook. Currently trading at $277, I believe that the stock is far far far far undervalued. And below are my reasons why:   


* **Is Facebook profitable?** \- Yes, 2019 profits of $18.4billion on $70b revenue. We still have Q4 2020 to go and as of Q3 2020 Facebook generated around $21.5 billion in revenue up 22% year-on-year (beating estimates) 
* **Do they have debt?** ($277m as of 2019 with $55billion in cash)
* **Competition** (they own a couple in IG and Whatsapp, but you also have Twtr, Snap, TikTok - FB is still most profitable out of all of them, better balance sheet) 
* **Growth** (Room for IG commerce, still yet to monetise whatsapp, could start off in non western countries if they wanted to do it slowly) 

From a balance sheet perspective, this is a solid business bearing in mind that almost every business took a hit from Covid. Facebook is not a 1-product company.. and they shouldn't be seen as such. The core FB app isn't going to be the source of future growth per se. Think Oculus, think Whatsapp payments, and many more.. ultimately, Facebook has one thing that everyone values - **DATA** from older audiences on the core product, to younger audiences on **Whatsapp and IG.** 

# What is the major risk? 

# Regulatory split up.. I don't need to go into details here, but we all know that FB is under a lot of anti-trust scrutiny much like AT&T, Microsoft and Standard Oil experienced. 

Most people say that FB could be broken up.. and I say, this is more reason to **BUY.** 

Typically when a company is forced to split, it's existing shareholders will experience a split in shares across the various baby subsidiaries.. 

***Let's use AT&T for example:*** 

>On Jan. 1, 1984, more than 3 million AT&T shareholders were given new stock: For every 10 shares of Ma Bell they owned, they received one share in each of seven new regional phone companies, or “Baby Bells.”  
>  
>10yrs later in 1996, their investment had grown more than 600%. 100 shares in AT&T became 550 shares in 10 different companies. (source: [https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/)) 

All in All, most forced splits via regulation only served to make the companies stronger : Another example - Standard Oil led to Exxon, BP etc (good for existing shareholders) 

The bottomline is, Facebook is a wonderful business from a balance sheet perspective, and there is still room to grow.. the risks aren't as bad as they seem or different to any other business in the world and the only reason not to buy FB right now is probably your moral concerns of what they actually do. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

I ask because there has been a lot of talk on here about COUV and to be fair the DD is pretty good, but my issue is that is reads very emotive. It is as if someone is trying to sell the company rather than report unbiasedly on the company's current position.

We all get a little protective of companies we invested money in, but sometimes I think that clouds our judgement and emotion towards what we invested into.

We should all do our own DD, bit honestly everyone doesn't always and we rely on others.

I used to work at company B that helps distribute company A's products to online platforms for public to buy. Company A's products consists of their own products and products from other smaller companies. One of these smaller companies is company C, my current employer.


As far as I know, by the time I got hired, my current company (C) stopped using company A to distribute our products but we have some sort of business relationship with one of its subsidiaries. We still use them to promote our niche products. Other than this, we directly hire vendors like Company B (along with other vendors) to distribute our products to the public.

In many ways Company C is one of my current employer's competitors. I was never exposed to any financial documents including earning when I was with company B. Company C would just put in order for Company B to distribute X amount of new products every week or so. I guess the only confidential info I was exposed to was their products before they were made available to the public.


As of now, all the info I get from Company A is from their website and other public sites that monitor new products in my industry.

Not to worry, with an incoming democratic president, the executive branch will let marijuana legalization slowly flourish, even without full federal legalization. 

**Introduction:**
$GTBIF (Green Thumb Industries) is a US-based marijuana company founded in 2014 and currently operates in 11 states. [Many of its sales](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cannabis-stocks-that-should-be-profitable-in-2021-2020-12-12) come from high-margin derivatives such as edibles, vapes, etc. that can’t be made at home. As part of its profile, it owns the luxury cannabis brand Beboe, which has been called the  “[Hermes of Cannabis]( https://www.entrepreneur.com/company/green-thumb-industries) ”. Remember: If you can’t afford a Berken for your wife, maybe you can afford this.




**Why GTBIF:**
What do we love when investing: Growth and Cash Flow


GTBIF has had 31.1% year over year [revenue growth]( https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Green-Thumb-Industries-Reports-Revenue-of-157.1-Million-and-Positive-Net-Income-of-9.6-Million-or-0.04-Per-Share-for-Third-Quarter-2020/default.aspx) and generated 157$ million in revenue this year. [With New Jersey, a 1$ bn market]( https://mjbizdaily.com/new-jersey-voters-legalize-a-potential-billion-dollar-adult-use-market/) set to become a full recreational state in 2021 (where GTBIF already has existing medical dispensaries), and NY to follow soon after, this growth should continue and potentially even expand.
 

Now for cash flow, GTBIF recently reached positive earnings per share 0.04$, which is great to have for such a fast growing company in a flourishing market. It has succeeded where many other marijuana companies have failed: creating money and managing debt to bring value to shareholders. Their cash flow should only continue to grow in the near future.




**Dangers:**
The biggest danger that I foresee is possible competition from companies such as Curaleaf, Cresco labs, TerrAscend, Accreage Holdings, Canopy Growth, etc. 


In regards to its primary competitor Curaleaf, Green thumb has a stronger balance sheet. They both have similar cash on hand, but curaleaf has 580$ million in debt compared to green thumb’s 204$ million. Moreover, curaleaf has a higher market cap at 8.27 billion vs. green thumb’s 5.378 billion. I believe GTBIF is a better option. 


Most of those other companies are unprofitable and do not have a clear path to profitability. Over the long term, many can and probably will succeed, but I believe GTBIF has a head start and is in the best position._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is that paid site that visualizes public company reporting data?

It's sort of in the vein of a lot of the Fed-related doom and gloom you see on this sub, except with seemingly pretty good analysis.

https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/

I'm curious to hear what people think.

An excerpt that provides a pretty good summary:

>Basically, the petrodollar system and the associated fiscal policy is fraying under its own inherent flaws over decades, which again gets back to the Triffin dilemma that to maintain a global reserve currency, you need to export an increasing amount of your valuable assets like gold reserves or your industrial base. That cost inherently makes these sorts of systems long-lasting but not permanent.

>At first, having the global reserve currency is an exorbitant privilege, because the benefits of hegemonic power outweigh the costs of maintaining the system. Over time, however, the upside benefits stay relatively static, while the costs keep compounding over time, until the costs outweigh the benefits.

>And from there, the value of the system depends on who you ask. Folks who are often on the higher end of the income spectrum who worked in finance, government, healthcare, or technology benefitted from this system, since they obtained many of the benefits of globalization and none of the drawbacks. Folks who are often on the lower end of the income spectrum, specifically those that make physical things, are the ones that benefitted least and gave the most up, since their jobs were outsourced and automated at a faster rate than other developed countries. But now with China also undermining the structure of the system, even the geopolitical/hegemonic benefits for the political class are subverted as well.

>As the system frays, it’s easy to point to external nations as the cause of this fraying. When they begin pricing things outside of the dollar-based system, or employing mercantilist currency policies, or building pipelines, or deciding to do something with their dollar surpluses other than reinvest them in US Treasuries, it can seem as though they are undermining an otherwise sound system.

>In reality, those external actions are a symptom of the more underlying flaws in the system: the fact that the United States is no longer big enough as a share of global GDP to supply enough dollars to fund global energy markets and global trade, the fact that the United States has to run persistent trade deficits to get dollars out into the system, and the fact that an all-fiat global currency system incentivizes mercantilist currency manipulation by many countries to generate trade surpluses against the US wherever possible._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone please tell me how dangerous my investing strategy is?
