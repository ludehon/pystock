ETG Tax-Advantaged Dividend Fund Hi all, long time lurker. I know chasing dividend yield is generally frowned upon for long term investing growth but I'm looking a for a medium risk place to stash some cash for 5 to 10 years that is going to do better than a 0.4% interest rate on a HYSA. I'm okay with the risk of a market downturn in that time frame.

I've been looking into dividend funds that hold mostly blue-chip stocks and came across ETG. Current dividend yield is about 8.5% a year, paid monthly, but the expense ratio is over 2%, half of which is due to interest on the fund's debt.
 
Considering it's trading 12% below its NAV, has a good monthly yield, but taking into account the high expense ratio, I feel it would be a reasonable mid-term investment. My main portfolio is VTI/VXUS with a few individual picks thrown in and will remain that way but I dislike the idea of money just sitting around aside from the 6 month emergency fund, which remains in a HYSA. 

Thoughts on ETG or similar fund's like RVT with high yields that are mostly qualified dividends?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Corporate OTC (TransOcean) bonds and seniority I am currently looking at TransOcean bonds and they seem to be trading ***substantially*** below par, and I am wondering where I could find additional information on each bond - such as a bond prospectus?

I've got the ISIN, but I can't seem to find a breakdown on the bonds.

I am mainly interested in doing this because I want to figure out their seniority and IF TransOcean goes into bankruptcy that one can expect payment if the bonds are senior.

I attached a picture of the bonds that I can access from my trading platform.

With regards to getting a fair representation of a growth outlook, it would not do zoom justice by looking at competitors in the video conferencing space.  Instead, I am thinking it would be more fair of picking another growth story that started off as the leader during the early growth stage of a new rapidly adopted technology or service.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any ideas on exponential growth companies  that is widely adopted and that may show comparable user growth figures and maybe that started off more as a free type of service?  (the best I can come up with is Match or Tinder, Netflix, but those are also more consumer focused)

&#x200B;

Being that it is currently selling at \~50x sales, its likely in large part of the idea that they are expected to come up with future revenue streams, perhaps you may have some other ideas for how to approach valuing zoom prior to them increasing user growth and prior to them coming up with new revenue models.  I have thought of a lot of directions on where zoom could go with their overall business,  and Eric Yaun has validated such thoughts a couple times. The question still looms - "Yes, but how much and could sales go beyond what the market is currently expecting and just how much in sales is needed to validate its current market value._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BHC Earnings Jitters?

The CFO indirectly said no, the current spin off plan doesn't contemplate an equity raise, by explaining sources of extra cash flow and lower future debt levels. Then he gave an example of a *hypothetical* spin off where they would raise equity before spin off. This started the sell off.

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Impact of Steelcase (SCS) hack? Steelcase, along with the rest of the market, tanked at the start of Covid-19; but as employees have have moved to working from home there's been an increase in demand for home office chairs. If you've been in the market you've probably noticed that at the top of every recommendation list is either Herman Miller or Steelcase. Both saw a big Q2 earnings that made their stock price jump (MLHR jumped massively) but SCS dropped back down.

I saw this as potentially a good time to invest in SCS considering they're still doing very well and are probably undervalued, but then a little over a week ago Steelcase filed an 8-k with the SEC saying they'd been compromised by a ransomware hack.

Since Oct 22nd their store (store.steelcase.com) has been down with no signs of going back up. But not only that, I've had an order for a Steelcase chair placed through an Amazon Steelcase vendor for 2 months now; it had supposedly shipped weeks ago but the order has somehow vanished since the hack. The vendor says all of Steelcase's systems are down and Steelcase is pretty much unresponsive. Steelcase's marketing team on twitter has been DM'ing me apologizing saying their team is working around the clock and keeps saying check back later; but each time nothing has changed.

This hack seems pretty serious and I can't imagine they're making any money with their online store down and all their systems to work with their vendors also being down. I'm already past the point on Amazon where I could cancel my order and walk away and I imagine some have... It looks like they might be at the point where they either need to pay the ransom (however much that may be) or do something else drastic.

What effect do you think this could have on their stock price? As of now it's only been effected ever so slightly and the news around their hack has been very quiet. Also interesting is that they have pretty much no insider sales all summer up until the day before the hack (supposedly) when a director sold 1/3 of her stake..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ali baba stock falls sharply today Hi friends, 
The Alibaba stock fell sharply today by nearly 10%, erasing most of these past few weeks’ gains. It seems to be connected to an affiliate company’s, Ant Group. failure to successfully launch its IPO, promised to be the largest in history. 

Do you believe this is a sign to reduce BABA, sell it, or an opportunity to get more baba stocks at discount. 

Alibaba is much larger than Amazon in terms of market share, yet the value of its stock is dramatically lower than Amazon’s, by a factor of ten. However, alibaba operates in the Chinese market, which everyone agrees is a much less mature and much less transparent market than the US financial market. Ant Group’s failure to put their stocks in the Hong Kong stock exchange due to a last moment disclosure issue is a dramatic illustration of the risk associated with investing in China. 

Where do you people stand on this issue?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on $SOLO? Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp. (ticker "SOLO") is the manufacturer of a one-person tricycle kind of EV.  Last week it announced the first shipment of it's flagship Vehicle, and that it will open six new retail locations in the U.S.  

It's a functional and existing EV (that looks kind of funny), but right now it only has a market cap of 231 Million. Compare it to any other EV producer, even those that don't have ANY producs out, this one is kind of very cheaply valued imo. Now i understand thatthe product is very different from the other EV producers, as the market for such vehicles is more limited, but it still seems like quite a bargain to me right now. The Stock peaked at \~$4 this year, and has been falling off since, but popped 20% after the news of new retail locations and the shipments arriving.

It will have new models in early 21, as it has communicated with commercial partners and added modifications for transport hatches and similar, so there definitely is interest also for commercial fleets, my would guess delivery services at least.

There's an article that explains China's new monetary policies. ([source](https://www.investorinsights.asia/post/china-s-monetary-policy-and-the-future-of-foreign-investment-in-china)). In summary

2. Maintain "Normal" Monetary Policy for the Long Run
3. Greater Reliance on Market Forces + Broadening Access to the Capital Markets
4. Opening Up the Domestic Markets to Foreign Investors
