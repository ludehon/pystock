State Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in a decision that could hurt Uber, Lyft and other gig companies in numerous lawsuits. https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-high-court-ABC-test-for-gig-15871187.php#photo-20493841

California’s strict “ABC test” that makes it hard to claim workers are independent contractors applies retroactively, the state Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in a decision that could hurt Uber, Lyft and other gig companies in numerous lawsuits.

The ABC test was issued in an April 2018 decision called Dynamex that said workers must be considered employees unless they A. work free from control of hiring entity; B. perform work outside the usual court of the hiring entity’s business; and C. have independent businesses doing that type of work.

“Public policy and fairness concerns, such as protecting workers and benefitting businesses that comply with the wage order obligations, favor retroactive application of Dynamex,” said a unanimous opinion authored by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in May 2019 had said Dynamex should be retroactive.

The Dynamex decision underpins California’s controversial AB5 gig-work law, which codified the ABC test while exempting numerous professions, and expanding its reach beyond wage orders.

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig companies classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees, saying they rely upon that model’s flexibility. Doing so also saves them millions of dollars on benefits, minimum wage, overtime and other expenses. The gig companies spent $220 million convincing voters to pass November’s Proposition 22, which keeps their workers as independent contractors and exempts them from AB5 going forward. Union groups sued to overturn the measure this week.

Prop 22 does not shield the gig companies retroactively. They are facing a range of lawsuits over employment classification, from both government agencies and their own workers. The Supreme Court decision means that if the gig companies lose those cases, they could face much bigger penalties since they could be found responsible for actions before Dynamex took effect in April 2018.

In the biggest one, California’s attorney general and three city attorneys sued Uber and Lyft in May. The California labor commissioner sued the two ride-hailing companies in August, saying they committed wage theft by misclassifying drivers. Various drivers and couriers have joined forces in misclassification lawsuits against Uber, Lyft and other gig companies.

Uber and Lyft did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Boston attorney who has filed misclassification cases on behalf of gig workers and janitors said the decision should help California workers seeking redress over wage violations that occurred before April 2018. She has lawsuits and arbitrations pending against Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, DoorDash, Postmates, Instacart, Shipt and Amazon.

The court “emphasized that this strict test was necessary because the prior looser standard ... had led to inconsistent outcomes that did not adequately protect workers,” she said in an email. “This decision is a further indictment of Prop 22, which the gig economy paid for last year in the hope of not having to provide its workers the benefits that the California Supreme Court has made clear are so important to our social contract.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airlines discussion?  

Ever since Ackman pulled off that billion dollar job I've been interested in how fuckers like him could predict the market so well based on world events. .

First off for airlines to return to pre-covid levels about 70/80% of the US population has to be vacinated, in order to achieve herd immuinity. Watch this video by Dr.Campbell to get a better understanding of the recent surge in cases (he has other videos about the mutations of the virus as well.). Anyway I noticed today airline stocks were up for no reason at all, the "talk" of stimulus, and the "talk" of vaccines caused the surge of prices. Things were looking pretty good today, problem is, the US is behind on vaccines and has messed up numbers due to doctors taking time off over christmas. Everything in the news tells me to buy calls on all the fucking airlines for next week, but I am not so sure anymore. maybe there actually will be a second wave, and a second lockdown and biden will use the stimulus package to soften the blow once he gets inaugerated on the 20th.

I think that with the proposed money from the new Biden bill will pump commodities further since inflation is expected.

Oil is still needed to create products at refineries. Another major point is the fact that in the case of a war we will need oil to fuel planes, ships, cars etc. electric seems too expensive and timely to use in that situation.

Good morning, I have a question about the bond market. The following paragraph is from a book I was reading and I would be thankful if someone could please help me understand it.

The paragraph 

The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄2% and even more against 41⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the market decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going interest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the market price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this period. 

Question

Wouldn’t the price of a bond go up if the going interest rates go up? An investor would make more money by owning the bond, so I assume the demand for that bond would go up thus the price will rise. However, in the last sentence on the paragraph above, it says the interest rates went up and the bond price went down. I’m confused and any explanation on this would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you, 감사합니다

Just randomly came across this graph on Seekingalpha website, it seems like an important indicator since it is in the front page. But what does that 3 804,84 close price mean? I mean the graph doesn't even mention any expiry date. What this graph is actually supposed to say?

So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.

So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.

I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.

Has anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) made a step into the right direction: https://www.politico.eu/article/eat-insects-new-eu-rules-menu/ 

Reasons why I think this is huge:
 - protein-rich alternative to environmentally unfriendly meat, meaning younger generations will be consuming this
 - cheap to manufacture, way cheaper than meat
 - People won't even notice that they are eating insects, it will be just another cryptic ingredient in processed foods. It's really just a cheap source of protein.

1) **Currently selling in 4000 stores and across all 50 states** \- This is due to them not being a "slap CBD on a package and sell it" company. They spent millions ensuring their abide by FDA regulations and hence why they're products are in every state  
2) **Cash is King** \- They went public with over $30M USD in cash, making them one of the most cashed up CBD companies in the world  
3) **Now USDA Certified Organic** \- This is huge and goes with their focus on ensuring they comply by FDA regulations. This is a bon-a-fide wellness company imo and its not just about CBD  
4) **Just announced entrance into Europe via Ireland** \- This is not just a US play anymore, they'll be exporting across Europe making it much more viable to increase their sales well beyond just US players  
5) **Very tight float to begin trading on TSX** \-- They've got a very tight float of just 10M shares trading until the 4 month unlock comes on previous rounds. That leads me to believe they'll pour a good amount of that cash position into marketing this company knowing how tight the shares trade right now

Hi guys a few weeks back I came across a little company that has a new approach to lithium mining.Lake resources nl
Now I'm still a little destroyed from yesterday so I'll make it short 

Normal lithium mining : you pump out water into a pond wait for the sun to dry it up and collect the salts.

Lake resources :pumps the water out into their machines - magic happens (imma provide a link to their site you can look up exactly how they do it) and when they got their lithium they pump the water back down
.
 2 key differences: first you don't dry up the only water resource in the area
And second battery grade lithium needs to be pure and only 30%of producers currently reach acceptable levels.
The lithium lake resource produced is 99.something% pure.
The company is a penny stock currently valued at 10 cent but it went up 3 in the last 4 days I think.
A bill gates led fund organization already pumped 20mil into it and the company has already bought key lithium sources. 
It is still at the beginning but with a greener solution to lithium mining and in the end delivering a much higher quality product in shorter time (no need to let the water evaporate) I see huge potential.
Green energy wave is coming and they'll need oc copper and nickel but let's also not forget battery grade lithium.

1 last thing  picked up In a recent interview with the ceo i watched. Apperently the tech they use is capable of ramping. Up production fast meaning If a customer suddenly wants 2times the lithium it Is no problem since for then all it takes is to put up a few more "cubes" as the ceo calls them.
Guys look into it if you want, I think they got a bright future ahead.

.... Glad I made it short.. Anyway hope its interesting for some of you and have a great day.

So i see in many financial applications (courses) that cashflows have to be discounted to a discount rate (or opportunity cost of capital). Does that mean i should discount cashflows of my investments to a rate to which i have access today if i place my money?  

In my country there are govies bonds funds that "guarantee" something like 2% return, does that mean i should discount cashflows of my investments/projects at this rate? Am i getting this right?  

Meaning that i choose to invest in my project, instead of in a govies bonds fund, so my project has at least to provide me a return greater than 2%?  

It also means that if my project can provide 100 in one year, i should not "see it" as 100 today, but rather as 100/(1+2%), which i do get is the present value of 100. But don't see the link with the ability of me being able to invest 100/(1+2%) today...

What would happen with regards to investing if society hugely reduced consumption of products. For example, if people stopped consuming "unnecessarily" - e.g. focusing on longevity of products such as technology, vehicles etc; saving more money, and avoiding leverage/debt. In this situation would GDP start declining? What if society stopped looking at economic growth and GDP as measures of success?

So what's NextEra Energy? Summarized from Wikipedia:

* It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization. (At 160B currently)
* Revenues of over $19.20 billion in 2019. Operating income of $5.35 billion in 2019.
* About 14,000 employees throughout the US and Canada.
* The important subsidiaries include
   * The Utilities;
      * Florida Power & Light (FPL) - A Florida electric utility. Notable for having wider profit margins than usual.
      * Gulf Power Company - Electric utility in the Alabama area
   * NextEra Energy Capital Holdings (NEECH)
      * NextEra  Energy Resources (NEER) - The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world. Importantly, expansive holdings in the Midwest.  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt.
* They also have a 35% stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies.

[In  fact, I'll just direct you to NextEra's IR page, because for some  reason they've placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find them.](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-policy) You can flip  through the Policy, Strength, Funding/Capital Structure, Cash  Flow/Leverage, and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company. But basically, they're extremely healthy as a  company. Notably, they've been [unwinding positions for cash](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/11-02-2020-222338600) recently despite their solid balance sheet.

Now,  I'd like to point out their P/E: 41. Yup, this is a "boring" utility company trading at 41x P/E after running up 200% in 5 years and 80% in  2. For reference, Microsoft is trading at 34.90 P/E. As far as utilities  go, I think it's fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets.

Summary of the fundamentals;

1. Management is extremely reliable
2. They're the market leader in renewables deployment
3. They've proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries
4. High P/E, but in a stable industry
5. They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures

Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Biden's upcoming stimulus. Let's start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements;

1. Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters
2. Pushing renewables directly
3. Creating long-term middle class union jobs

Among utilities, [NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewables](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-11-2020-173514490). Straight from the link above:

>According  to S&P Global Trucost, NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics, among others,  including signed contracts to build approximately 12,000 megawatts of  additional wind, solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019, and NextEra Energy's announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, equivalent, to a  40% reduction in absolute emissions – and this, despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period. Already, NextEra Energy reports  more than 50% of its generation is from zero- and near-zero-emitting  sources.

I think it's fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition.

Additionally,  as a result of their investments so far, they're not untested when it  comes to deployment: They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition. If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry,  it's quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity, clearing  point two.

But point three is the  really interesting one. Let me start off with a question; If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middle-class jobs in  renewables, how would you go about it? Would you invest in the companies  making the end product? Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too?

[Let's  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/khx7eb/stimulus_bill_includes_35_billion_for_clean/) Big thanks to [/u/millerlit](https://www.reddit.com/u/millerlit/) for summarizing. Also, [I'll be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point on](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/reports-and-filings/annual-reports). Please bring up a copy if you'd like to verify the numbers I claim.

* $1.5 Billion for Solar - Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally, NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER. 12% of NEER's generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report (p.13).
* $2.6 Billion for Transport - NextEra probably won't get much of this, but they have [made an acquisition](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-08-2020-123104618) in the field within the last month. It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here, but let's just leave this as a  hypothetical.
* $1.7 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program - I'm not 100% sure how  they'll break this down, but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers. [NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can see.](https://www.fpl.com/save/programs.html)
* $1.08 billion for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies - NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field. [I don't think they'll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry, but they're definitely a serious user.](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-energy-to-spend-1b-on-energy-storage-projects-in-2021)
* $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. -  They're going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons.
* $625  million for new research, development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies - 65% of NEER's renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report. They're  going to get a nice cut here too.
* $850 million for geothermal technology development - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize - 0 stake in this race
* $6.2  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies - FPL  is investing quite heavily here, as 74% of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas (p.9). They're going to get a good portion of  this.
* $6.6  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors - FPL generated 22% of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 (p.9). They're probably going to get a  fair slice of this.
* $4.7 billion for fusion industry - NextEra isn't spending money on fusion development, as far as I'm aware.
* Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables - A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses. [Here's a map of US public land so you can take a look.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_federal_land.agencies.svg/1280px-US_federal_land.agencies.svg.png)

But you get the point by now - NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly. On top of that, the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines. Frankly, there are very few people  better positioned than a well-run utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates. When I put it like that, it's no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trump's policies - and that they're extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden.

But there's even a fun political trap for the republicans here. Do you know  where the best place to place on-shore wind turbines is? [The midwest](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/itl/sed/gsg/mri50_2mph_inc_gumbel_v2.png) ([Source](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/maps-non-hurricane-non-tornadic-extreme-wind-speeds-contiguous-united-states)) - [A notable republican stronghold area](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=US+2020+election+results). NEER's own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report (p.13) backs up that their expansion is largely in that area.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a pro-union and pro-clean energy vote there - forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections. It helps that that's pretty much the economical way to play it too.

To sum it up, I think NextEra's going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down, even if only because of their financial resources, deployment experience, and contracts with  suppliers. A big portion of this is that I don't believe the market has  priced in the amount they're collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been "FAN/TAN/ICLN/QCLN goes brrrrr".

Let's talk about the competition; The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy, Sempra Energy, and Xcel Energy. From one look at them  it seems like they're (1) much smaller and (2) at best half off on P/E  so I didn't really look at them too hard if I'm being honest.

Now for the bigger question; Do I grab NEE or \[clean energy ETF of choice\]?  Really, it's up to you. I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now. That, and I'd much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else. That being said, those ETFs  have much more hype behind them, which is an important consideration in  this market.

Short-term catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th. I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call, and a huge bump in interest if they announce that they're  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more.

Anyways, onto positions and how I'd trade it;

* If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme long-term  -> buy shares and hold, I think this is going to heavily outperform  the S&P 500 into the future.
* If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me  -> Jan 20 2023 80c's. They print if the stock goes up \~15% in the  next 2 years because IV is super low. I grabbed 10 at 12.10 at the start  of the week on the dip, but I think they'll open 13.00+ tomorrow. Keep  in mind that you don't need to hold till expiry, I'll probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits.

Would like to hear some feedback and suggestions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Affirm IPO questions My Fidelity account is large enough for me to participate in IPO offerings. I get the IPO announcements on a regular basis and from time to time, I do submit a statement of interest. I do not always get allotted shares when I participate but I have been able to get some, most notably Facebook.

The process usually follows this path for me:

Fidelity sends out an IPO notice with basic information about the company, type of shares, expected price range and the period of time you have to submit a statement of interest

If I submit interest via the link in the e-mail, I get sent to a form on Fidelity asking for how many shares I am interested in purchasing plus I have to acknowledge receipt of the prospectus. (Individual accounts usually get less than the amount you ask for.)

The last day of the interest period is usually the day before the actual offering. After the market closes, the underwriter is supposed to declare the effectiveness of the IPO (i.e. the offering price). All the receiving brokerage firms then are supposed to allocate their shares to their customers (both institutional and retail) and the customers are supposed to confirm they agree to purchase the shares they are allocated at the offering price. The period of time the underwriter is supposed to do the declaration is before midnight but in practice, it happens right at the market close. This is to allow the brokerages time to allocate the shares they do get, send e-mails out to the customers and get the confirmations back. 

So the day before the IPO I usually get an e-mail from Fidelity late afternoon (Pacific time) letting me know yes I got shares or no I did not get shares allocated. If I did, I have to let them know I want to go ahead with the purchase by midnight eastern (its just a click on a link to do this)

OK, that's the set up for the story and questions:

I expressed interest in the Affirm IPO last week. The target price was $31-$38. Monday I get an email from Fidelity saying that Affirm has submitted an amended prospectus which raised the target price to $41-$48. I get my normal e-mail during the day yesterday to be sure and reply to the offer if I get shares allocated to me. At about 8:00PM Pacific, I get an email from Fidelity stating they are no longer participating in the IPO which in part says:

*PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.* 

Why would Affirm do this? Is this a way to limit the IPO to only certain shareholders in the company? Is  this even normal? 

By the way, the offering ended up being priced at $49.00. AFRM opened at $94 and closed at $97.24 for a gain of 98.45% today.

Accurately valuing high-growth SaaS companies is incredibly hard.

A lot of the software companies on the market today look incredibly expensive when viewed through a value lens and analysed using value metrics such as P/E ratio, price-to book etc.

But these companies are generally performing very well.

One of the problems, in my opinion, is related to how we think about profitability for high-growth subscription businesses. In a ‘value’ world, the more earnings/profit in a given year the better. However, with SaaS companies, it's the total profit over the lifetime of the company that matters. In SaaS, the majority of the revenue gained from an individual customer will come in the future, not at the point of customer acquisition/initial sale. Therefore, a SaaS company that is currently highly profitable is a company that can’t find good opportunities to efficiently acquire any more customers. If they could, they would be spending that money on sales & marketing since every dollar spent acquiring a customer would create well over a dollar in cash flow over the lifetime of that customer.

So, if standard value metrics don't work for high-growth SaaS companies, what does?

Are there any metrics that you use to analyse these companies that you think are particularly insightful???

One metric that i've found to be very useful is the **Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth** metric.

# Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth

Enterprise Value/Sales is one of the most common metrics you will see used to value high-growth tech companies. However, it misses the main reason that tech companies get such high valuations in the first place - their growth rates.

If you have two companies both valued at 50 times sales but one company is growing 60% per year while the other is only growing 20% per year, then you are looking at two very different companies.

When looking at the price of a tech company relative to its sales, it is critical to also look at its growth rate. This is where the EV/S/G metric is so useful.

The formula is as follows:

**(Enterprise Value/Revenue) / Revenue Growth Rate**

The closer to zero that a company gets on this metric the better. Companies with a score of over one are not doing as well and are not growing fast enough to justify their high valuations.

Let’s look at Zoom as an example (revenue and revenue growth are for the last 12 months):

**($104.36B / $1.96B) / 262.3% = 53.2 / 262.3**

**= EV/S/G of 0.2**

So you can see that even though Zoom is valued at 63 times sales, because of it’s exceptional growth rate over the last 12 months, it actually has an incredibly strong EV/S/G ratio. If it can keep up its exceptional growth rate (granted, that is a big IF), Zoom is actually undervalued relative to many other SaaS companies.

A company on the other end of the scale with a far less healthy EV/S/G ratio is Bill.com.

Bill.com has a relatively similar EV/S ratio to Zoom of 62.6. However, they 'only' grew 39.24% over the last 12 months. They have an EV/S/G score of 1.6 which is far worse than Zoom’s 0.2.

**EV/S/G for popular tech companies:**

Here is the EV/S/G score for 6 of the most popular high-growth tech companies, ranked from best to worst.

1. Twilio = 0.58
2. Crowdstrike = 0.68
3. Datadog = 0.69
4. Docusign = 0.72
5. Shopify = 0.74
6. Okta = 0.94

I'm trying to put together a list of the best metrics to analyse and compare these companies, so please let me know if there are others that you find useful. Would love to hear them

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does anyone here understand why enable midstream has such high debt? What is up with enable midstream and their high debt to ebitda it's like 4.7-8 and their covenenat is 5. I don't understand why they don't slash their dividend more they should have been paying it off more. Does anyone know?????? Also they don't seem to be diversifying their bolt in acquisitions.......it just seems bizzare I mean I guess they have a revolver but still their payout ratio is excessive for creating long term sustainable shareholder value.............anyone want to comment_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Employer offered for us to buy shares of new Sister Company. Should I invest? Our CEO/Owner of our Company came forward and offered to sell us employees shares of his new company at a 250 million dollar valuation with the goal of going public in 5 years.  Our current Company is worth about 300 million dollars. 

The issue? 

The new company is still in the idea stage. While the product is nearly finished, it has no current customers or revenue as it hasn't been released. I've always been a value based investor, so investing into an idea at such a high valuation terrifies me.

What's making me reconsider my fear?

Our CEO offered to give us back our investments back if the goal isn't reached. However, as I read the contract, I don't see any mention of that. This appears to be a vocal contract. 

I'm not sure if I should invest or not. I might just throw in some play money, but in terms of serious investing, I have no clue._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does the SEC have the list or definition of indexes that an ETF is allowed to track to be classified as an Index-Based ETF? The [SEC Investor Bulletin on Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)](https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130194852/https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf)) divides ETFs into two classes: Index-Based ETFs and Actively Managed ETFs. As its name indicates, index-Based ETFs track some indexes. Unlike Index-Based ETFs, Actively managed ETFs are required to publish their holdings daily.
