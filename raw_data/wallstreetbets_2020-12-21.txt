 Last Friday I yoloed on vxx calls and tonight we go to tendy town I sold at market open while on the toilet at work. I was going to just sell half but when I saw 38,000 I knew I would never forgive myself if I lost it, so I sold everything. I think its finally time to take $5,000 out and just enjoy not being broke.

I had 240 vxx calls bought for $17,000, sold for 38,000

Good luck out there, has been a pleasure

Ride the wave.**

Corsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand. Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.

My DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals as well as analysts**

And because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with

**Catalysts:**

**Generally Speaking:**

* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**
* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**
* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**
* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**

**Q2 2020:**

* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release
* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards

**Q3 2020:**

* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.
* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3
* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.
* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.
* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.

**Q4 2020:**

* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year
* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)
   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console
* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.

**Q1 2021:**

* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.
* **Stimulus payment effect**
* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming

**Fundamentals, for my Buffet & Munger enthusiasts:**

**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**

* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020
* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income
* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)
* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)
* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021
   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**
* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.
   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion
   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.
      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**

&#x200B;

The sharp decline of the stock price was nothing more than profit taking. The company itself, Corsair Gaming, continues to be a leader in the Gaming industry with "The new guidance implies revenue growth of 50%-52% compared to last year". Corsair is profitable year after year even beating the first estimated earnings by 0.25, which is more than double the expected.

"Corsair’s CEO Andy Paul stated, “In our Gaming and Creator segment, we continue to see strong sales in all price points, which we believe indicates that we have both new customers buying gear as well as existing customers refreshing and upgrading".

But with the increasing popularity of streaming and quarantine, "The highest growth continues to be in our streaming products, as gamers want to share video content with their friends and fans".

The positive outlook of this company continues to be a great short term AND long term hold.

>In reaction to the upbeat guidance, Wedbush analyst [Michael Pachter](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/michael-pachter) raised the price target to $49 from $34 and reiterated a Buy rating on Corsair. In a research note to investors, Pachter opined, “The pandemic has expanded growth well beyond the normal level, but as growth has largely been driven by new gamers and streamers entering the market, this has widened Corsair’s user-base for the long-term, in our view.”

SpaceMobile has the ability to be a game-changing kingmaker, which is why key players like Vodafone, Rakuten, Samsung, and American Tower have invested over $300M.*

Basic Intro:

* SpaceMobile (Ticker: NP(A)) has created the first and only space-based cellular broadband network that can provide coverage across the entire globe

* SpaceMobile’s technology has been validated
   * **Launched and successfully tested service** with BlueWalker-1 satellite in 2019
   * **+$100M initial capital raised from strategic investors** including Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung NEXT
   * **Another $230M** in a new private funding round led by the **same investors** at **$10/share**, in addition to **+$232M** in Reverse merger funding, gives SpaceMobile nearly **$420M net cash** to fully fund Phase 1 launch in 2022
   * Binding, mutually exclusive **commercial agreements** covering **+1.3B subscribers** in place with Vodafone, AT&T, Telefonica, Indosat, Telecom Argentina, Telstra, Tigo, and Liberty LatAm
* SpaceMobile has built an insurmountable competitive advantage
   * **+750 patent claims** that support underlying technology
   * **161 space scientists and engineers** with **40 prior satellite builds/launches**

   * Launch of 20 satellites in 2022 with **commercial service in 2023**
   * Phase 1 cash flow will support Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 launches
* **SpaceMobile will be the kingmaker in the wireless market**, creating clear winners (its partners) and losers amongst Wireless Carriers
   * AT&T, Vodafone, and Telefonica, representing **+1.1B Wireless customers**, recognized this and decided to partner with SpaceMobile
   * SpaceMobile has signed marquee Wireless Carriers to **mutually exclusive contracts in key regions** to get scale and demonstrate its business model, starting with the Equatorial region
   * For the remaining regions, **SpaceMobile could auction off partnerships to a single Wireless Carrier which could generate substantial economics**
   * Wireless Carriers that SpaceMobile chooses to work with will **drive substantial capex savings** over time
      * Partnering with SpaceMobile will **reduce the need to utilize spectrum and buildout expensive towers/backhaul** to expand coverage of existing networks
* The competitive landscape in the US Wireless market **may be forever changed** by SpaceMobile
   * If AT&T offers customers **100% 5G Global Coverage**, how can **Verizon and T-Mobile compete?**

   * Verizon and T-Mobile **already feel the pressure and are actively voicing concern and opposition to the FCC** claiming that SpaceMobile’s satellites *may* interfere with their networks
      * Enterprise value of **$381B** for Verizon and **$260B** for T-Mobile could be up for grabs
   * **AT&T also had much to lose given its $40B commitment to the US Gov to build out FirstNet**, the US’s public safety network that is used during disasters. Why? Because **SpaceMobile could make that network less relevant**
   * **American Tower**, the **largest cell tower company in the world ($129B EV**), is increasing its investment by **participating in the $230M PIPE at $10/share.** This is a big hedge for the company because **SpaceMobile’s technology could be an existential threat to the cell tower industry.**

Financials:

* Partnering with Wireless Carriers through a 50/50 revenue share model provides **immediate access to customers** and **removes need for marketing, customer acquisition** or **backhaul costs**
   * Project 9M subs in 2023 growing to **373M subs in 2027 (153% CAGR)**
   * 2027 projections represent **under 30% of current potential customer base**
* Revenue to grow rapidly from **$181M in 2023 to $9.6B in 2027 (170% CAGR)**
   * Modest global ARPU assumption of $2.15 by 2027

   * Sufficient capital to fund upfront capital investments, with **+$420M** in net cash
   * **+$1B** in EBITDA by 2024, only 1 year into commercial service
   * **EBITDA margins to expand rapidly and reach +90%** in steady state
   * **$16.3B of unlevered free cash flow by 2030**, leaving capital for reinvestments and R&D to expand service and extend market leadership
   * SpaceMobile could institute a sizeable dividend comfortably beginning in 2024E or 2025E

Trading:

   * Growth Space Companies: Iridium 13.5x, Virgin Galactic 26.0x, Momentus 4.7x
   * US Wireless Carriers: AT&T 7.1x, T-Mobile 8.3x, Verizon 7.5x
* At **4.3x to 7.2x 2024E EBITDA**, SpaceMobile would be valued at **$25 - $40 per share,** a conservative estimate based on low-growth carriers as comps
* Highly attractive risk/reward at $11 → **risking 90c to potentially make $14 - $29**
   * NP(A) has a **downside floor of $10.10** in cash NAV up until the merger closes
* The deal will likely close in late February to early March 2021.

Permission to share DD was granted by u/apan-man_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO holders the past couple weeks _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MVIS - ALL ABOARD THE LIDAR TRAIN Q: what’s the best part about LAZR?
A: there’s a much cheaper stock with better tech.

Here’s where MVIS comes in. MVIS has been working on Lidar tech for 20 years and has a robust patent portfolio. They have both an AR vertical and an autonomous driving vertical. 

MVIS has been confirmed as the key creator of the chip that powers the Microsoft Hololense 2. Look it up it’s dope. The US military’s IVAS program is gonna be buying up a shit ton of these. The Hololense will have more future versions with the realistic end goal of these smart glasses replacing smart phones. There is currently an AR smart glasses war going on between MSFT, FB, AAPL, and GOOG. 

And the Lidar for autonomous vehicles? The CEO of the company specialized in this field at his prior role at Google and said MVIS’s tech will disrupt the market. The autonomous Lidar sample will be ready by APRIL OF 2021 which is way sooner than the other Lidar companies. 

The stock has been on an absolute tear lately. The company has said they’re exploring strategic alternatives which includes the sale of the company and there are several very interested parties. 

On their board of directors is Dr. Spitzer who was very accomplished at Google and Judy Curran from Ford. This tech is the real deal and I waited til the stock left penny land to make this post.

It wasn't immediately apparent what sent the three genetics stocks soaring. At the same time, shares of **Uniqure** ([**QURE**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QURE)) — another genetics stock — plunged after the Food and Drug Administration placed its hemophilia B clinical study on hold.

Crispr stock zipped up 13% near 167.90 and Intellia shares surged 16.3% near 64.40. Uniqure stock, on the other hand, tumbled 15.7% near 38.70.

## Genetics Stocks Ablaze

Genetics stocks Crispr, Editas and Intellia are studying a method of gene editing called CRISPR.

The company, Crispr, is testing a gene-edited treatment for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia with **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([**VRTX**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).

Intellia has treatments for sickle cell disease and amyloidosis in testing. Amyloidosis is a rare disease in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up on organs and interferes with normal function.

Editas is testing a treatment for Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10, a blindness disorder.

All three genetics stocks have bullish [**Relative Strength Ratings**](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) north of 90.

My bet of the next 2-5 years is NTRA (Natera)

This company has a proprietary test called Panorama that uses maternal blood draws to test for fetal genetic abnormalities.  It has the most accurate test of all other NIPT tests available in the market.

ACOG recently recommended Panorama to be standard of care for all mothers regardless of age or maternal risk.  This test is currently not FDA approved.  Many insurers cover Panorama for high risk pregnancies but not low risk pregnancies.  Meaning that once it is FDA approved for all pregnancies, more insurers will cover this test, and revenue will skyrocket.

Let me put it this way:

Ten years ago, if the mom was high risk for a genetic anomaly like down syndrome, we would stick a giant needle through the belly into the uterus to sample the amniotic fluid during the 2nd trimester.  Then we would run some tests on this fluid that would go through a logistic regression (fancy math) and say hey MAYBE your kid has a genetic mutation.  Like 30% maybe?  70%?  I don't know?  Lulz?  Maybe you should abort maybe you shouldn't?  I dunno it's the second trimester already?  The alternative was to do chorionic villus sampling where you take an even LARGER needle and take a biopsy of the placenta.  Both had an increased risk of killing the baby and neither were sensitive nor specific.

Now you just draw the mom's blood and you can sequence the fetus' DNA when the baby is in its the first trimester.  And now you can abort the baby when it's the size of a dime and the mom doesn't need to see a head, torso and four limbs when it's aborted.

Anyways

You herd it from me first

I bought shares

[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vst-insider-buying-and-selling-2020-12/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vst-insider-buying-and-selling-2020-12/)

This is the first piece of news that caught my eye. Management in the company seems very high on their future and this just confirms my theory. 

2) Insanely undervalued at $17.50 at the moment. Median PRICE TARGET at $31!! & Reasonable PE of 15, compared to their Industry Competitor's Average of 40 PE

[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VST/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VST/research-ratings)

WSJ has 10/12 analysts rating VST as a BUY, and 2 of them have them at a hold. Additionally, VST is trading at a very reasonable price of $17.50, and the LOW for Price Target is at $19, and a high at $34. With a median price target of $31, this stock is guaranteed to rebound  this next year.

3) EXTREMELY CHEAP PREMIUMS 

[waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance) shows leap calls for 2022 and 2023 at barely 2 dollars for a 20 dollar strike price. All premiums for this stock are massively undervalued.

4) Political Outlook

With new president Joe Biden coming into office, the renewable energy sector is poised for takeoff, with companies like Vistra Corp ready to lead the way. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that BIDEN = ENVIRONEMTNAL COMPANIES GO UP

&#x200B;

Now we need to discuss the negatives of this company:

1) They provide dividend.

While the general trend has been that dividend companies tend to not grow as fast as others, Vistra Corp must prove otherwise. 

2) Recent Downward Trend of Price

Recent prices for VST have trended downwards, but with a bright 2021 to look forward to, Vistra hopes to turnaround their recent misfortunes. VST has a market cap of around 8Bil and pulled in 3 bil revenue in the last quarter, with around 5% being net revenue. They show signs of being a strong company with high potential.

Summary: Invest at your own risk and do your own DD but VST is an extremely undervalued stock that is poised to take off in the next year. Buy LEAP calls and go to the moon.

20X 20C JAN 2022_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XPEV Triangle Breakout Potential Sorry I used the p-word in my last post, mods. XPEV genuinely looks a very juicy setup right now with a promising triangle. Last week, it only lacked a catalyst to make a move. Today's news on [XPEV's first electric SUV delivery to Europe](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xpeng-delivers-g3-smart-electric-104600457.html) fixed that. Targeting $52-54 by Friday. High IV, so I wouldn't baghold.

I am a RE-tard. As in I can’t even spell it correctly so be warned!*

CIM is involved with trading b/bb/non investment grade mortgage backed securities(think who the guys in The Big Short shorted, and these are worse). With stimulus talks likely to get approved this week, the hardest hit areas of MBS should get a break from rental assistance payments and an extension on mortgage relief. Mortgage backed securities should outperform upon news of the stimulus bill passing, and then hopefully again around February or March as Congress passes a stronger bill in January after the Georgia elections(expect it to drop between the announcement of stimulus and the announcement of the next stimulus). It also has a bonus dividend on Tuesday 12/29/20 of .30.       

1/15/21, 3/19/21, 1/20/23 $10 calls.         


I like the Greeks, I like the dividend, I like the stimulus, I do not mind the risk, I think this is a viable long position to hedge yourself against if you are a high risk investor. The puts would not be bad to buy if you can time the wedge properly, or buy short dated puts based on known events. The option writers holding onto the position can make consistent returns as well from a return on dividends(10%). Either everyone wins and nobody gets cucked, or everyone gets cucked and nobody wins. 🚀🚀🚀 not 1000% overnight, but still a decent long hedge for traders thinking long but still wanting better returns            

Obligatory: I believe Amazon is going to go 🚀💸🚀💸🚀💸💊. I believe Jeff Bezos will figure out a way to get vaccine distribution, reap rewards from stay at home investing, pull viewers from netflix for a month or so as people go holiday shopping, and their earnings might show surprise reports from their m&a from q2/3/4(likely not as badly hit by covid as they had believed, sold early). If Bezos can get involved with vaccine distribution Amazon stock might be worth 4K by February. Good luck all, happy hunting!

Here is what I think will happen:

Tesla has been in the news lately for their grid battery-storage. 

https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/australia-picks-massive-tesla-battery-to-ease-transmission-constraint

Basically, as more countries push for renewable power, there is a need to store excess energy produced when power-usage is low, and distribute that when usage is high. Batteries are quickly becoming the best way to do that.

On the Google side, they are dedicated to powering their data centers with renewable energy, and now have stated they have a goal of removing diesel backup generators from their data center site. While on a test site right now, this could be a framework for the future:

https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/google-alphabet/google-thinks-data-centers-armed-batteries-should-anchor-carbon-free-grid

Here is where it gets good:

>The Google data center team in St. Ghislain will use lithium-ion batteries instead of a diesel generator as power backup for 3MW of live, production computing load – a first for Google.

>A grid powered by renewables could use data centers connected to it to store excess renewable energy and discharge it at times when there isn’t enough renewable energy being generated.

>Texier declined to name the vendor who would supply batteries for the Google data center pilot in Belgium, but said the project would use a product that already exists on the market, sold by “a pretty well-known entity,” one of the “leading energy storage integrators in the industry.

Data centers use a metric shit-ton of power, and whoever Google works with will need to be very experienced with batteries and grid-storage - this could be a perfect fit for Tesla. 

From a financial standpoint, if they actually do use batteries to back-up data centers, the installations would be fucking massive, to say the least. Google's new data centers draw 100MW+, meaning Tesla's new 450MWh storage in Australia would only be able to back up a data center for 4.5 hours in a power outage. That definitely wouldn't be enough for Google, who would probably require installations on the GWh scale instead. However Tesla has proven that they have a very scalable solution, and an installation of that size would not be technically much more challenging than what they currently have.

Google data centers already cost [$1-$2 Billion per site](https://datacenterfrontier.com/google-building-more-data-centers-for-massive-future-clouds/), so a few hundred million dollars per battery installation isn't out of the question. That would before the subsidies they would almost certainly get from utilities as well, who will probably be desperate for more grid-storage in the years moving forward as renewables explode.

Granted this all could be wrong, and Google might partner with another company, but face it Alphabet and Tesla are going to be *the* power couple on Wall Street next year.

TL;DR: Tesla and Google are gonna make sweet sweet battery love next year, and we are all gonna benefit_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citi raises price target for MSFT to 270 from a hold to a buy To anyone who followed my MSFT dd earlier last week, Citi has raised their price target on MSFT an entire 19% stating it's growth in the cloud field.

&#x200B;

Read the scriptures below nerds:

&#x200B;

**What the fuck is FCX?**

Freeport-McMoran is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American - operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. According to their latest earnings, they generated copper and gold sales 7% above their July estimates. They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.

**Copper**

After a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:

Copper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover. Like steel, this is a no brainer cyclical economic crash play, and people will always fucking need copper.

https://preview.redd.it/91u0up2ntk661.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ed529e67a3c56655ba6c3da2f521da6166e82b

**70% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity**

* Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations, high efficiency motors use roughly **4x more copper** than traditional automobiles
   * We know the EV hype is there and coming into fruition with countries committing to be climate neutral by 20\_\_, there will be even more demand for copper as production ramps up
* Solar panels and associated hardware use copper vs. the traditional fossil fuel power generators
* 5G higher frequency spectrum requires more than 10x the hardware of 4g and there's plenty of associated copper cabling

**Copper supply takes a long time to ramp up (i.e. getting mines approved, excavation, etc)**  and FCX is in the midst of massively ramping its biggest mine which will roughly double output next year.

Copper is used in building construction, power generation and transmission, electronic product manufacturing, and the production of industrial machinery and transportation vehicles. Copper is an essential component in the motors, wiring, radiators, connectors, brakes, and bearings used in cars and trucks.

&#x200B;

**FCX OUTLOOK 2021**

**Volume Growth (2021e v. 2020e)** = Copper 20%+, Gold 70%+ 🚀🚀🚀

**Expanding Margins =** EBITDA/Cash Flows to approximately double in 2021e compared to 2020e  🚀🚀🚀

**Near-term: Laser Focused on Execution** = Continued net debt reduction 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Sustained growth** in copper demand is expected to continue as **copper is essential to economic activity** and even more so to the modern technological society. Infrastructure development in major countries such as **China and India** and the **global trend towards cleaner energy** will continue to support copper demand. 🚀🚀🚀

The report claims that Taiwanese manufacturers are preparing to ramp up for production of "Apple Car" components as early as the second quarter of next year, adding that Apple has been secretly testing dozens of prototype vehicles on the road in California. Apple received a permit from California's DMV to test self-driving vehicles in 2017, and it was spotted using Lexus SUVs rigged with LiDAR equipment that year.

While many sources have claimed the Apple Car will be released between 2023 and 2025, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the report cites an unnamed director at a major Taiwanese manufacturer who said Apple is targeting a September 2021 launch.

This is what $PLTR ACTUALLY does and why it's valuable. So I had a long conversation with my friend who works in the AI space about Palantir and how you could begin to value their technology. I'll try to keep it concise and simple, but TL:DR; buy 2023 calls right now. Any strike, at any price.

1. Everyone and the financial media has it wrong. If you are reading an analysis, article, or price target revision, and they call it a "Data Analytics Company", you can ignore it entirely.

2. The real value of the company is basically in creating models for algorithms. The model is basically a piece of code that can be implemented into an application. It's essentially the algorithm. A model/algorithm is created by giving it a goal, and inputting a set of data the AI can use to get to the goal more efficiently. 

3. By basically creating an intuitive, easy to use software that Data Engineers can use to create models, they are eliminating the need to build one from scratch. This is a huge efficiency for companies that want to use AI and algorithms to improve their business, software or application. It means that instead of hiring an entire team of Data Engineers, you only need to hire one or two.

If you are having a hard time getting your head around this, here is an analogy:

Say you are a new company that wants to sell tendies online. Are you going to hire a team of developers to code and build a website and entire e-commerce platform from scratch? No. You are going to hire one person, who has a more diversified set of talents, to manage a Shopify site and Shopify template.

This is why Shopify is valuable.

Now, consider the following scenario:

Let's pretend Spotify doesn't exist yet and that you want to create a music streaming service that generates recommendations that increase listening time by using an algorithm. Are you going to hire an entire team of Data Engineers to figure out how to use a massive set of user data to develop a model, or are you going to just use Palantir, and maybe even contract one of their Data Engineers to do it for you, without paying anybody a salary?

Look up the salary of one Data Engineer.

That's why Palantir is valuable. They can benefit anybody who wants to implement AI/algorithms into their software or applications, without the massive investment of hiring Data Engineers to create it from scratch. For years, this has been the "edge" of companies like Google and Amazon, who are at the forefront of AI. Palantir is democratizing this "edge".

I will not be responding to comments from people here saying this is incorrect, because you are all retards and I understand this is a gross simplification. It's also, of course, not the only thing Palantir does. But, I think it is the most scalable in the short-term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WFC is my next stupid gamble let’s see what happens... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $130,000 bet on Jay-Z's Weed SPAC ($SBVCF) Merging on January 15th (DD in Comments) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just 25x overnight _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blowing my stimmy check on PLTR shares like _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RC Ventures raises its GameStop stake to 12.9%. It becomes impossible for Sherman and Friends to dilute his stake below 11.7% 1. RC increased his stake at $GME from 6,500,000  shares to 9,001,000, a **38.4% increase in RC's ownership of the company**.
2. In the recent [Q3 conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/), the company said they may sell up to $100 million worth of shares. Everyone knew that was a poison pill intended to dilute RC's stake at the company in case he decided to do a hostile takeover or any other type of intervention.

$100 million at $14-$15 per share would be about 7 million shares, or about a **10% increase in the total number of shares outstanding**.

3. This means that **now it's impossible for Sherman and friends to dilute RC's ownership to a level below 11.7%.**

Calculation:

(RC Share) / (Current Outstanding shares + Max potential shares offered) = 9,001,000 / (69.75M + 7M) = 11.72%

&#x200B;

PS:

Even if the company goes absolutely crazy and sell 20 million new shares, RC's stake would still be 10%:

&#x200B;

*RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board “regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements."* 

*While RC Ventures “desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

Last      month Cohen sent a letter to GameStop's  board saying the company's      brick-and-mortar-centric business model  is outdated and urged it to reduce      the number of physical stores,  focus on improving e-commerce and explore      other tech-driven  opportunities. GameStop's revenue has plummeted in      recent years,  falling to $6.4B in FY19 from $9.6B in FY11. Cohen is one of       GameStop's biggest investors via his investment firm RC Ventures.

Outlook for January ferrous scrap pricing remains strong
Expectations for January scrap prices in the US remain upward even after the December steel scrap buy week brought the biggest monthly shredded scrap price increases in over a decade.

Platts US shredded scrap index was calculated at $373.25lt delivered Midwest Dec. 18, unchanged from Dec. 11.

In December trading, the index rose by more than $80 from November. Some market sources expected another major increase in January while some others expected it to be capped at $50.

Strong demand from domestic mills and rising export market demand have been supporting the strong market sentiment.

A scrap supplier expected strong end-product market impact in January scrap trading. “Mills are busy and they will be extremely busy in Q1 and there are no planned outages,” he said.

Nobody will want to face scrap supply issues while end-product prices are skyrocketing, he added.

A mill buyer echoed the strong demand predictions and said he expected January pricing to be $30-$50/lt above December trading. He did not expect much divergence between regions and grades due to an overall tightness in the marketplace.

A dealer, meanwhile, expected markets to trade in a wide range in January. “It will be hard to peg where the market will be next month as it will most likely trade at a wide range,” he said.

The dealer expected prices to rise by $30-$50/lt in January on the back of the strong end-product markets. There is nobody turning any scrap down and they will try to get every pound, he added.

Another dealer echoed strong demand and tight supply conditions. “From scrap supplier to service center, the whole supply chain is at very low inventory levels,” he said.

The second supplier emphasized surging demand for ferrous scrap from Latin American markets coupled with Turkish demand which has been causing more material to flow to the docks. Platts HMS FOB US East Coast assessment rose by $122.75 over the month to $428/lt on Dec. 18, a record high since January 2011.

In addition to the impact of rising export markets, challenges in flows due to winter conditions and rising domestic demand could push scrap prices up by $50-$70/lt in January, according to the second supplier._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀 $AMD 's Lisa Su and her shiny new ARM'ed ROCKET 🚀 Most of you already know $INTC CEO [Bob Swan should’ve \*\*\*\*ed a silicone butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/) instead of blowing old man farts during every earnings call this year.

I know that PLTR is going to the moon, and these past couple weeks have been super frustrating as it seems to currently be refueling for a run up. But while you wait for your pockets to return to tendie town, might be worth checking out a company that does basically **\*the exact same thing\*** that is currently valued at 10x less than PLTR. 

Full disclosure - I used to work at Cloudera and was there when they IPO’d in 2017 - the same day as CVNA. At the time, Cloudera was one of the biggest unicorns in Silicon Valley as they had billions in funding from some pretty notable VCs and a hefty amount from Intel.  After a super disappointing IPO, I sold off every share I owned over the next year as companies like Carvana soared. At the time I was convinced that nobody would ever understand the complicated software that Cloudera built and sold, and despite solid growth, lots of enterprise customers, and a road to profitability, it just kind of… fell flat.  

That is, until WSB took over the world. Fast forward to 2020 and a PLTR IPO that grew massively over the next several months - I was completely shocked. Yes, I know you’re all retarded but I didn’t know you were \*that\* retarded that you would give PLTR, a company founded 5 years before CLDR with only 20% higher revenue and lower margins, a 10x higher valuation (\~$50 billion market cap for PLTR vs \~$4 billion for CLDR). I have former colleagues that worked with me at CLDR and who now work at PLTR and they think it’s complete insanity that PLTR has a valuation that much higher than CLDR. If you all fundamentally believe that PLTR is worth more than $40 billion, then you are missing a huge opportunity with CLDR. 

Cloudera and Palantir use basically the same exact underlying software components to build fundamentally the same exact solutions for their customers. Don't believe me? Go look at the [CLDR](https://github.com/cloudera) and [PLTR](https://github.com/palantir?page=1) Github repos and look for terms like "hadoop", "spark", "parquet", etc. Yes, there are some differences in their product but they are more the same than they are different - at the end of the day the biggest thing each of these companies do is data integration and analytics. However, their approaches, technology influence, and sales methodology should yield a similar or better valuation for CLDR than PLTR for a number of reasons:

* Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better [gross profit margins](https://ycharts.com/companies/CLDR/gross_profit_margin) (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, [CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001535379/ec48b119-7c21-4fa4-a3fa-2e3bf020c6fb.pdf) and 8% from services, while PLTR doesn’t seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. [PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/8a404f13-53a8-4610-9f9a-34add0ec1742.pdf) which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin.  
* CLDR reported an EPS of  .15 for the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR/analysis?p=CLDR), which was a beat of almost 67%. While PLTR reported an EPS of .09 for the most recent quarter, GAAP net loss is much worse (PLTR earnings were -$853M for last quarter and -$110M for the prior quarter, vs CLDR at -$14M and -$36M, respectively). Accounting for the effect on earnings of their recent IPO, PLTR is probably at least 3x less profitable than CLDR despite having been around for 5 years longer. 
* As another reference point, FSLY is currently trading at a 3x higher market cap than CLDR on negative earnings with a 3x higher net loss and 3x lower revenue. 
* Cloudera has surprised on earnings by at least 50% for each of the last 4 quarters, and should within the next 1 or 2 quarters no longer have a GAAP net loss, and their profitability should continue improving as they continue their pivot to [cloud-based SaaS solutions](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html). PLTR seems to be years away from achieving the same thing. 
* CLDR has broader sales reach and a larger sales force - they have some government customers (e.g. [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers/us-census-bureau.html))  but they [target traditional and high tech enterprises](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers.html). I never competed even one time against PLTR when I sold CLDR software, which shows that they are much too focused on a particular vertical/industry and/or do not have traction in the broader market. 
* CLDR has greater influence on the underlying technology stack that both PLTR and CLDR use (and AMZN/MSFT/GOOG clouds) because they contribute more code than any other company to the open source community that they all use. They also partner more heavily with big cloud service providers and technology providers (have [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/bigdata/big-data-appliance/5.1/bigli/cdh5.html#GUID-5B5969CD-FE64-46A2-A7BE-53AF6D11AE77)/[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/partners/cloudera) co-sell solutions, CLDR software works in all 3 major cloud providers and they have a SaaS solution that runs in all 3 cloud providers)
* CLDR has a [more broadly applicable suite of products](https://www.cloudera.com/products.html), as it can fit in the data warehouse/analytics space, the machine learning space, and the data processing space. It competes with other well-known software like traditional data warehouses (Oracle, IBM, Teradata), cloud native warehouses (Snowflake software, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and data science and machine learning unicorns like Databricks. Because of this, it has broad applicability vs PLTR who seems to target very specific use cases. 
* Given its cross-cloud compatibility and influence on the open source technology ecosystem, they would be ripe for an acquisition by a traditional enterprise software company who is trying to gain more cloud traction - for example an IBM or an Oracle. I would not be surprised to see them gobbled up in the next year or two. CLDR has a large growth SaaS solution that [grew 40% in the last quarter](https://investors.cloudera.com/news-and-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Cloudera-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) that would be a good buy for any of these old guard companies. 
* Both PLTR and CLDR have an 'L' as the second character in the ticker and an 'R' as the fourth character in the ticker which makes them easily interchangeable in any already existing shitposts or memes you've worked on
* CLDR offers a lot of opportunity for cloud and weather-related puns and usage of cloud emojis, which WSB desperately needs more of.  

For these reasons and more, I fundamentally believe that CLDR is massively under valued at a $4 billion market cap/$12.68/share and represents a great buying opportunity, especially if you are in the camp that thinks that PLTR should shoot through $30/share, to a $50 billion valuation and to the moon. I mean, SNOW has an absolutely retarded $200 billion market cap. There is no way that CLDR should be valued 10x less than PLTR and 50x less than SNOW.

Positions: GOOG (100 shares, long), SNOW 320c 12/24, CLDR 05/21/21, 20c

**TL;DR** **- If you believe in PLTR,  CLDR makes basically the same products, has a 10x lower market cap, is more profitable, and is worth a serious look as both a solid investment and as a potential acquisition target. Even if you believe it to be half as valuable as PLTR, that's 40$ upside on shares currently standing at 12$ a share.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IT DO GO DOWN ROBERT _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO gives me life _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First five figure YOLO &#x200B;

How to play utilities if your a CA RESIDENT

PCG was founded in 1905 and is the owner of the grid for most of Northern California. They literally own all solar contracts for these poop solar companies that operate in their teritorry. (IE SUNRUN, SUNWORKS, SUNPOWER v3 AND EVEN TESLA, they just recently Exited bankruptcy, secured government funding for wildfire protection, got wildfire insurance and secured the right to raise rates for profit, and j paid of all of their wildfire claims.

With president elect Biden stepping into office, everyone and their mother knows how Biden wants to go “green” but they don’t understand their is a significant energy monopoly working in the background, and it’s literally the power grid under our feet, because customers are land locked to their specific utility provider, even when you get panels you need the go ahead from your current utility provider to let your “contractor” connect your new system back to their grid, this in turn, lets them pay less money for new energy being made because they can buy your excess power, instead of operating a million dollar hydro electric damn, hence why their selling bass lake rn, it’s not profitable to make energy like that anymore, and the whole “shift” to renewables is just going to make them more money. GO FIGURE

Secondly, there’s has been a birth of an ev lobbying group, consisting of tesla pcg duke edison and others. To lobby for a restructuring plan to rebuild freeways in ca, connect them to said grids, and install EV and 18wheeler charging stations across California. The only thing people missed is that it was signed into law back in 2017, but is only know getting agresslivy acted on in my opinion because these multi million dollar companies are providing all the resources and contracting the work from the government http://www.rebuildingca.ca.gov


And this brings us back to Biden. He is a Democratic president and cali is a democratic state, his relationship with newsom has been reported as being damn near butt buddies, and the fact he elected butiegege as secretary of transportation makes me think this might eventually turn into a nation wide play, not just cali.

4. April 16 $45 calls
5. April 16 $50 calls

&#x200B;

I now want to sell weekly expiration $50 covered calls against my position. If those weekly calls end up ITM at expiration (Nio ends the week at $51) and I'm assigned, what is the priority in which my positions (1 - 5) are called away? Is there any way to tell the brokerage how to prioritize this (I'm on TOS)?

&#x200B;

My guess: first the shares (the brokerage doesn't have to exercise calls for this). Then they prioritize soonest to expiring options (Jan). For a given expiration, they'll choose the one that provides the most collateral relief (i.e. the lower strike call because it's worth more).

So the order I'd think is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, maybe they only prioritize collateral relief and ignore expirations.

I believe the time is right to shop for bargains in these two sectors, but identifying companies with a strong liquidity position would be key to success.  The stress test results released by the Fed on Dec. 18 is indeed positive news for the banking industry as dividend hikes are back on the table for Q1 2021.

[12-21] **The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).

We saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).

Here is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.

For the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.

We also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.

While the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.

We also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.

So, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.

We also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.

We also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.

In some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.

We also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED’s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.

Let’s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn’t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn’t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer & Moderna.

Maybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. 

My belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don’t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What you guys think of lab grown meat stocks? To simplify the science behind it: Living cells will continue to grow as long as the conditions exist. Science can build warm chambers which artificially create the conditions of being in a body, allowing for labs to grow meat.

Right now, the process costs about $11 per hamburger, but there is no theoretical limit to how cheap this can get. Meanwhile raising cattle is expensive and global production is limited by available farmland. And "plant based meats" are useless since most people would rather eat the beans they're made from.

People promoting lab grown meat emphasize how no killing is involved. Of course, if that was anyone's real motive we'd all be eating beans and peanuts for protein. The real bottom line is how this can make quality food cheaper and in large amounts.

And given the hype, it's perfect for an autist play. With publicly traded growers there three contestants:

1. Beyond Meat. They're dedicated to the stuff, but already mooned 500%.

2. Kellogg. Big company, and artificial meat is far from their core business.

3. Tyson Foods. A meat packer invested heavily in artificial meat. They're trading below their Morningstar rated value right now, and they're price is pretty volatile but follows an upward trendline.

Final point is while the overly optimistic assessment is that artificial meat will hit store shelves in 2022. I don't think that will happen, as science doesn't ever move as fast as we think. Even so, the market will react to any and all scientific breakthroughs, so we don't need the company to show profit, and by the time they are selling artificial meat it will be too late for tendies.

I'm thinking buy a diagonal spread on a LEAP on Tyson. Eventually they announce good news and I close out on top._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ INTC from the executives, do we believe their hype? Here are the words of the executives and engineers at Intel

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intels-2021-predictions/#gs.o36ku4

2021 is expected to be a huge growth year for Intel. That would make sense given how shit 2020 has been for them. It has created a very favorable entry price for bulls and is still operating at an unusually low PE compared to its few competitors.

I think INTC is still being counted out because of news from competitors but people are not seeing the big picture of what's coming in the future and Intels strong position on it, backed by the largest funding in their sector.

Bonds with lower yield than inflation? This is just my opinion, nothing I can say with certainty. I stumbled upon this stuff while asking the question why are the Gov. Bond auctions overcommitted, although yields are terrible. So I started some digging and here it is:

&#x200B;

**Welcome to the Land of financial engineer-..., Magic!**

1) Some entity needs collateral for (options) trading or any leveraged play.

2) They rent collateral at a bank, because they don't want to own it. (Who needs that low yield garbage anyways?!)

3) The bank says no probs my friend, but we keep the right to re-pledge (=Rehypothecation) the security to someone else.

4) The entity doesn't care as long as they can have the collateral for their play, cuz their homie Jerome got their backs in case of emergency.

5) The Bank can now lend out the same collateral again and again and again and again. (insert Kelly Clarkson song here)

6) If the collateral is to low of quality you can just use your old friend collateral transformation to upgrade the quality of your garbage to pristine quality and lend it out again! ***MAGIC***!

7) $$$

&#x200B;

This can be a serious problem in case of a downturn, which can lead to a collateral shortage and the collapse of the System as we know it. So no worries it won't happen (:

Merry Chrysler (Meme) everyone!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Printing press yet again to go BRRR and cough up in the region of 3-5 trillion by summer 2021 The full [newsletter](http://www.expertise-asia.com/2020/12/governments-cash-hoard.html) if you wish to go over it. But the main take home is this :

>**The incredible amount of almost 6 trillion dollars of US government debt needs to be rolled over. In fact, it is a total of 7 trillion if you add the 1 trillion that is left for this year.** This will be a gargantuan hump to overcome. The deepest market in the world, functioning as it should, will not be sufficient for such a challenge.  
>  
>**What can the real market absorb? 1 trillion? 2? Maybe, but the rest will have to come from somewhere, and where else than the Fed?** \[...\]  
>  
>The Fed chair is correct in pointing the finger and saying that a future recovery is to be built on fiscal action, in yet another warning to Congress. What is to be expected in the short run, though? To be sure, the noise around an impending bi-partisan pandemic crisis package is getting louder, but this would likely be just a drop in the ocean. \[...\]  
>  
>In other words, while the FOMC with its less-than-expected dovish stance currently almost feels like a disappointment, we should count on the Fed to be a lot more engaging from early 2021. Just in light of those incredible refinancing demands at the Treasury, **what other prospect is there but to launch the printing press yet again and cough up in the region of 3-5 trillion, by summer probably, to make sure the Treasury market will not be dislocated.**

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla calls accidentally exercised at IBKR So I bought a weekend 690/700 call spread on Friday, and attached a stop loss order at .50. I ended up manually closing the position a little later for a small gain. But I never cancelled the stop order....

Then, around 1 pm the sell order was filled, leaving me short the same 690/700 spread. Tesla went to $695 and IBKR assigned me the 690 call, leaving me short $69k Tesla in an account with only $40k equity (infinite margin hack?), which I didn't discover until late Friday night. I woke up at 4 am today to close the short, luckily at $660. Only time I made money shorting Tesla.

I use a program that a ton of analysts use, and it just updated the fair value of FOUR to $96.18. Analysts will be updating SOON, like this week after they load up, and the price will follow. That's not even the DD though. Here it is  

Edit from mobile 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀



FOUR is the leader in integrated payment processing solutions. The new fair value estimate came as an average of 2 models, both using DCF growth multiples. 

**FOUR is currently trading at $70**

FOUR marketcap is just 3% of SQ, yet they do 10% of revenue and have a similar YoY Growth. P/B for FOUR is 18.3x meanwhile SQ is sitting at fucking 51.5x. Either of these show FOUR has huge upside, but to use the smaller number of rev/mc discrepancy, **FOUR should be trading at $233**

In another comp comparison, FOUR is just 1.1% of PYPL Marketcap, while doing 3.7% of PYPL revenue. PayPal is so big that FOUR actually has way more expansion and growth available, but ignoring that the revenue/marketcap discrepancy implies **FOUR should be trading at $230**

In a final comparison, FOUR is less than half of LSPD marketcap(Lightspeed POS), but this one is really fucking wild because FOUR does 5X MORE FUCKING REVENUE. This one is probably a tad out of reach and moreso implies that LPSD is overvalued and needs to come down a ways but since we know FOUR is undervalued and we don't know if LPSD is overvalued, we'll just pretend LPSD is properly valued and by the metric, **FOUR SHOULD BE TRADING AT FUCKING $710**

But comparisons aren't everything, CVNA and KMX are an example that investors will pick the more well known/currently hyped name, so the next thing you need to know is **The CEO is a fucking badass** Jeff Isaacman is his name. Forbes has done a few articles about him, the high school drop out that started a payment processing company in his parents basement, sold some equity, bought his old employer and created Draken, the world's largest private airforce, at age 28, whiel still running his POS company, sold Draken to Blackstone for 9 figures, used that to buy out several other payment processors, and is now a billionaire at age 37. Dudes a fucking genius, and because of his strategic buyouts, FOUR now does over **$200 BILLION ANNUALLY** in payments for over 1/3 of the country's hotels and restaurants including KFC, ARBYS, FOUR SEASONS, HILTON, etc. 


One reason FOUR hasn't caught on big is because it hasn't turned a profit as the new entity, but that will all change after this quarter according to the consensus of 7 American IT analysts who agree there will be a final total loss in 2020 before turning a profit of $27m in 2021 and **growing at an average rate of 145%** For the record though, Isaacman's original payment company was turning profit for over a decade. But with all the acquisitions they took on some debt and liabilities from the acquired companies.   


Jeff also still has a 38% stake in the company, meaning he's gonna continue to fucking kill it and we will make tendies in the process. Back to my original point, **I have seen several occasions where my program comes out with models which raise the Fair Value Estimate, and within a week Analysts have raised theirs to nearly identical numbers** This obviously isn't true for all analysts, but I've seen it a bunch. 



**Positions/Tldr** - I'm in for 1000 shares and have calls at all different expirys up to $110 through 2021. If you're more risky, you can go as far OTM as possible in the next year and you have a real shot of cashing out huge. It's extremely undervalued and when the price targets come out, it is going to go up with a green dick the likes of which have never been seen before_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ready for some green? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cheat sheet for everyone who trade stock or options!

For those of you that don’t know, Inseego deals with wireless 5G networks. Here’s why it’s a sleeping giant. 

1) They beat their revenue projections this year by 12%. In 2021, they are forecasting $362 million in revenue, which would be a 30% increase from 2020. 

2) Hospitals, schools, businesses, towns, and other entities that need wifi used to use Huawei. After the security concerns, they’ve begun to switch to Inseego. 

3) Their software security is state of the art. What just happened in the news recently regarding hacks? That’s right. They are already being used by state governments, seems like the federal government is in the market for fast, secure, 5G wireless solutions, are they not?

4) They have contracts with every major US cell phone provider, and are currently doing the same in Europe and Japan, as well as other places across the globe. 

5) Autonomous cars need wireless communications right? Inseego is already on it. 

6) Daddy Cramer is on board and supports them. Lessens the chance of him cucking you and saying it’s overvalued. 

7) Bullish Analysts say the stock is undervalued, and should be $17-$20

You’ll see a lot more of Inseego in the future, just remember you heard it here first.

Well...

JPM announced Friday after market close that they will be doing 30 billion dollars worth of stock buy backs. 

In case you Autist’s don’t know what that means. It means JPM will be buying 30 billion dollars worth, or roughly 240 million shares in order to make the price go higher. 

The average daily trading volume over the last 20 days is roughly 15 million. That means if they were the only ones buying, they could do nothing but buy for 16 days of average volume. That’s 16 days of the price moving up. 

Jim Cramer after seeing the news, “Nobody owns the banks. This could be explosive.” 

On top of all the fund managers who are now positioning long banks, you will have all of the R/Wallstreetbets traders buying calls (preferably weeklies) being purchased on bank stocks creating a gamma squeeze causing market makers to buy more stock as the price rises. Black Rock And other funds with data on retail will see robinhood traders buying, and will front run them thus driving the price up even more. 

JPM was the first to start buying back stock again, the others will follow soon. 

Your welcome.

Other people can write more about that shit, or we can B.S. about it in the comments here.

Here's my DD contribution in the form of an updated 4Q20 financial model based on the updated e-commerce order rate data & console sales we've observed from GME over the past weekend:

The stimulus deal is fully priced. If the amount was $1.2t or above we might have a positive move on Monday but $900bn is inline with bare minimum and fully priced in.

But that's not all. The market momentum is now gone. Upwards movements and ATH require catalysts and also the presence of *future* events. We are now out of *future* events for the foreseeable future. The election is done. The stimulus deal is done. Pandemic is done as vaccines are being deployed. Now all we have is boring unemployment claims that will remain stubbornly high and reduced demand for cars, online shopping and pretty much anything that was front loaded during the pandemic.

This is a sideways market for the next couple of weeks and coming February or March there will be a lot of profit taking.

JPow is out of ink starting Jan 1, 2021.

If you're smart you stop buying loans now because they are no longer backed by the FED. This also means that businesses will have a harder time raising money through loans and might have to turn to raising money through stock sales to get liquidity.

Couple issues here:

1. Low liquidity = deflation
2. Stock sales = higher supply and lower price

Let me know what other papers/features I should add below_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just opened a Robinhood account this month, am I doing it right? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ No Luck, All $SKLZ - an E-sports Gambling Platform Set to Rival $DKNG [Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) (SKLZ) is a mobile esports gambling platform that lets your mom and her boyfriend gamble on whatever bull shit mobile games they play. Users pay a fee to enter a tournament for the chance to win real money. The payouts are huge, and people are addicted to this platform: [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/)

**In fact, users of Skillz remain engaged on the platform longer than users of Facebook, Youtube, and Tik Tok (details below).** Skillz has well over $1.6 billion in gross marketplace volume and over 2 billion tournaments played per year.

We all know people love to gamble. The problem is, your 55 year old mom doesn't use WSB and the Stonk market to get her gambling fix. Instead, she's logging onto [Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) and playing Solitaire to try and win $200 to pay for your special ed class.

**They just went public by the same guys that took Draftkings $DKNG public, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan.**

[https://deadline.com/2020/03/jeff-sagansky-harry-sloan-flying-eagle-acquisition-ipo-1202875752/](https://deadline.com/2020/03/jeff-sagansky-harry-sloan-flying-eagle-acquisition-ipo-1202875752/)

Looking at DKNG's price action & valuation, it's quite clear that these guys know what they're doing. Management has a 2 year lock up period on shares so there is no risk of a dump.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: With expected revenues to be \~$225 million in 2020 (80% YoY Growth), margins of over 90%, no debt, a massively growing industry, an extremely diverse user base, and a platform that keeps its users engaged longer than Facebook, Youtube, and Tik Tok, this is the most obvious buy of 2020-2021.**

I won't go into too much detail because I know none of you can read, so here's a few sentences with pretty pictures to help you idiots understand why the stonk price will go uppies:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The esports/gaming market is way bigger than any comparable entertainment market, and is set for sustained growth into the future. Mobile gaming specifically accounts for a massive chunk of that. Here's a pretty graphic for all of you retards:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oh337os9ig661.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3670fca88b83cf5107e82bc99fb4faa420aa498f

**Skillz currently ranks above Facebook, TikTok and Youtube on the average length of time its users spend per day on their platform**:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wdql8jjaig661.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffc7bbed28ea825b987413a1a073e349809a23d

I know you're probably thinking mobile games are retarded. They are. But it actually increases the total addressable market for Skillz by A LOT. **57% of Skillz users are femaie.** Females don't even make up 30% of console or PC gamers. Additionally, **53% of Skillz users are over 45 years old.** Don't believe me? Look at this pretty picture:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r3gxwo1big661.png?width=1765&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ebbee4077f83f5c15543d82e9d2c54be4090a4c

It's also important to consider they are only currently a mobile only platform. Management has hinted at the intent to break into console/pc games. Obviously that's too far in the future for any of us to care, but just pointing this out so you can really understand the growth potential.

Here's some info on their valuation compared to some other tech platforms:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ffs1kjbig661.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=84cb215c01fc5ed70cc1bc7bffc0a8a799ceead7

**And the best part? Their average revenue per user is WAY higher than some other comparable companies like ZNGA or GLUU:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bp2o4h5cig661.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb4617187ce15cc018b357dc6c4e1c31a72f6274

Skillz currently does not even have ads on its platform and ARPU is STILL this high. The growth opportunities here are endless.

I'll stop here since this is about as much information as you drooling idiots can handle.

Long $SKLZ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 900 Billion stimulus is coming. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC too the moon. It's been great scalping _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SGMO- Investment Thesis- Full DD  

* **Wtf is SGMO?** It’s the most drastically undervalued gene therapy company on the market. They edit genes with zinc finger nucleases, a technology distinctly different from crispr.
* **Zinc Finger?** It’s theoretically better than crispr. More specificity and less off-target edits than crispr, but years of reading investor village posts and the occasional research paper aren’t easily summarized. And how it works doesn’t really change the thesis here.
* **Why is it undervalued?** Check out the market cap and past year’s price action of the competitors in the field

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|
|BMRN|16 B|
|CRSP|10.5 B|
|ONCE|Acquired for 4 B|
|EDIT|4 B|
|NTLA|3 B|
|SGMO|2 B|

&#x200B;

* **Why is BMRN on there?** Because Biomarin is SGMO’s largest competitor for Hemophilia A gene therapy, which also happens to SGMO’s closest to market product. But, surprise, SGMO has better data than BMRN! This year they reported higher sustained clotting factor levels and no bleeds within the first 52 weeks for the highest dose level of SB-525. Biomarin’s patients are having bleeds and requiring factor, and because of it (and the much better data from SGMO) BMRN got a rejection from the FDA when they tried to get accelerated approval to beat SGMO to market: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6) BTW, the SGMO Hemophilia A gene therapy program is also partnered with \*Pfizer\*
* **Partnered with Pfizer?** **Yeah, and Takeda. And Kite therapeutics. And Novartis. And Sanofi. And Biogen.** I’m retarded, but highly doubt those 5 big pharma partners and their entire team of scientists and capital allocation programs are as retarded as me. Look at the pipeline page: [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) And just for good measure, the Biogen/SGMO collaboration also included Biogen acquiring so much SGMO stock that Biogen owns like 17% of the damn company!!!! Acquisition rumors abound…and if you look at the table above most of those other names don't have anywhere near the number of partnerships/pipeline programs SGMO has.
* **Biogen partnership is for multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, the single largest unmet need in medicine today.** And Biogen didn’t fuck around with crispr for it.
* **Speaking of pipeline, I hope you clicked on the link to the pipeline page.** Aside from the Phase 3 trial with Pfizer, they have four Phase 1 or 2 trials, and 13 disclosed preclinical trials. And 7 wholly-owned (not partnered) programs. And an estimated 600-700 million cash runway, with the expenses for the phase 3 program with Pfizer covered by Pfizer, and a potential reimbursement of a few hundred thousand to $1 million plus per patient (still cheaper than replacement factor infusion therapy).
* **Why isn’t this worth more?** I dunno, but I can guess. CRSPR was featured on Radiolab and had some articles written about it a few years ago, and has had enough press that most people have heard of it in passing. SGMO also had some false starts, once a long time ago when they were basically a different company trying to tackle some bullshit like diabetic neuropathy. Another time when they were trying to do gene editing in live patients for MPS II (the CHAMPIONS ½ trial) that didn’t have great results. Yes, they are trying to edit genes in live humans. Turns out it’s hard. And yes, it worked via detection of targeted integration via liver biopsy, but had not edit enough cells to be clinically significant (they’re still working on it).
* **What else are they working on?** T-cell therapies, which can address anything from transplant rejection (their wholly-owned TX200 trial) to autoimmune diseases (IBD, also wholly owned). They bought the company TX Cell for 84 million in 2018 for this purpose.
* **So why the hell are you telling me about this now?** Last couple weeks have been weird and SGMO has been taking off. Look at the last year specifically this month- it fucking rocketed off, pulled back, and has started to climb again. Price action on this stock has always been super wonky. If you follow it as close as I do, you’d notice the huge price spike happened \*after\* they reported the positive Hemophilia A data at ASH Dec 7th- the price spiked Dec 10th.
* **Anything else going to make the price rocket up?** Aside from the fact that every gene therapy company chart has been a goddamn hockey stick this year, here’s some events: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904)
* **Also, its not in the ARKG gene therapy fund yet**, but theres a good chance Cathie Wood might shift profits from other names to SGMO #1 to diversify and #2 because it’s comparatively cheap as shit.
* **Speaking of price, HCW just gave it a $25 price target.** Truist gave it price target $23. Some badass analyst with huge nuts had it at $36. The average is like $21. Mine personally is $25 this year and $45 long term. Here’s some undiagnosed autist on IV making a case: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148)
* **Yeah but do you own any, you kooky fuck with a wizard avatar?** Yeah, I have 2500+ shares, 25+ ITM calls, and 40+ OTM calls across all my accounts. I attached a screenshot from my traditional IRA. It’s most of my tradeable retirement. Not sure if this counts as YOLO? I feel like I’m wearing a life helmet at this point having held and accumulated this shit for 3+ years and finally seeing it take off.
* **Thesis summary; SGMO is undervalued.** They have superior gene editing technology and a shit ton of shots on target in their huge pipeline with 5 big pharma partners, and they are getting close to hemophilia A gene therapy being commercialized in early 2022. Even if they completely fuck up more than half their pipeline they’re still undervalued.
* **TLDR; why to invest in SGMO:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline)
* **TLDR; Buy SGMO now.**      LEAPs > short term, this stock trades weird and I don’t know how soon      it will rocket off, but started to launch a couple weeks ago. **Shares      are still cheap.** Don’t buy calls too far OTM in case of buyout. **May      and August calls in the $17-$20 range seem cheap. Jan’22 $20 strike looks      good to me, or Jan’23 $25 strike. $20 conservative price target by      year-end 2021. Long term price target $45.** 
* *Note: the original post got banned because I updated it and used a four-letter word that was a banned ticker. I'm sorry to anyone that commented on that one.*

Bill Ackman loves Michael Bloomberg. He endorsed him for President and even gave him funds for campaigning. Bloomberg is one Ackman's heros.

The description of $PSTH is basically mature whale, unicorn, family owned, only wants a fractional portion with the ownership intact where we can closely work with them. He wants it to be resilient to Covid-like events. 

Bloomberg LP checks all the boxes.

It is taking some time because it is a huge deal.

For Michael Bloomberg, he gets to cash out while retaining his power. Although that's having his cake and eating it too, what's bigger for him is that he gets into the news cycle. Look at what the stock market did for Elon Musk. This exposure, while sharing a slice of his pie, will propel him into the top of the newsfeed for a long time.

This is huge especially if Michael Bloomberg really wants to take a run at becoming the President of the United States. It is in best interest and would look really good showing the public he is focusing less on business.

With strong leadership, a stimulus, and covid spurred focus on home improvement, BBBY is posed for a strong earnings report on Jan 8th and could retest its october highs.

**Overview:**

BBBY is a home improvement retail company that operates through the US and Canada.

**Leadership:**

Mark Tritton - I'll quote Jim Cramer here, "the **NUMBER-ONE CEO** they could get"

\- **Instantly fired 6 worthless boomer execs upon entering the company**

\- at Target, he remodeled 1800 stores, revamped their ecommerce business, and launched successful 40 private label brands

\- a further look into BBBY's financials will show you how he's **already** been successful in turning around the company

**Financials**

Let's start by looking at their 4 year financials: **THEY ARE AWFUL**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b21b1r1bxf661.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=74607aa690f1366f99a4be518fd4cf55bd631f24

\- decreasing revenue

\- decreasing profit

\- increasing SG&A

\- decreasing and negative net income

**But let's see how the financials have been since Mark Tritton came**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jq96gfmbxf661.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca215c3c066961f87892e8facdf243821e129a3

A **COMPLETELY** different story

\- Revenue growth

\- Cost of revenue down

\- Gross margin at levels unseen for years

\- Racking up Cash

\- Paying off debt

\- EBIT rising

Obviously, COVID led to one awful quarter that skewed the rest of the year, but Tritton is already showing results. His earnings call also showed guidance and a vision for the company.

**Notable statements from earnings call**

\- **Strongest earnings in** **2 YEARS**

\- The average age of the customer **decreased by 6 years**

\- Digital revenue up **89%**

\- **MORE SHARE BUYBACKS**

\- Lots of cash

\- Closing lower performing stores and focusing on an omnichannel approach

\- **2 million new customers** online

\- Lower coupon usage -> higher margins

**Notable Transactions**

\- High volume on the 20$ C expiring jan 15th after earnings

\- Insiders have been buying shares @ 20$

**Technicals (I am awful at this)**

\- Support at 18.5 **meaning that 18.7 is an appealing entry point**

\- MACD is **BEARISH**

**TLDR**:

Short term, **BBBY will run up before earnings** as it has historically

Long term, **BBBY is posed for a turnaround** similar to that of Target's with excellent leadership and a great vision

**JIM CRAMER IS BULLISH ON BBBY AS WELL**

**POSITIONS: Shares, Jan 15 21 C, Jan 8 20 C, Dec 31 20 C**

Let’s start with the bad Covid, Oil prices, and debt. Obviously covid has screwed everyone. Next point I’m sure some of you are still holding oil from back in the spring when it cratered to earths core and you retards got paid to take delivery of 69,420 barrels of oil, your wife’s boyfriend I am sure is not happy that he still has this environmental liability sitting around his house. Since then oil has recovered and stabilized and as much as you guys jack off to EVs for the near and mid term we will still be drilling. Lastly debt this company has 1billion in debt due this upcoming year.

Why it’s a buy. The company is sitting on 2 billy in liquidity between 1 billion in cash and an undrawn credit facility of 1 billion dollars. So they have plenty of liquidity to cover their debt commitments in 2021. They are currently trading at .5x sales and ~.1 of their book value basically pricing in bankruptcy. They have a contract back log of 8 billion which is 8x their market cap and their 1 billion in the bank is equal to their market cap. They recently received a favorable ruling on their business structure where a creditor was basically trying to force them into recievorship.

They are well positioned in the industry to take advantage of new drilling opportunities in the deep water market.

Position I am wheeling shares, but the Jan 2021 $3C look juicy too.
