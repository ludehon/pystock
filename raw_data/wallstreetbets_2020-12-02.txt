 Ford v Tesla 
Anyone expecting a Ford bought by Tesla? Imagine the absolute monopoly on the car biz that these 2 would create. Marketing/labeling the Tesla truck as a F150 and vice versa would get HUGE buy-in from both the EV fans and the shit ton of ppl who buy the best selling vehicle in the US (f150). This deal would be AMERICAN AS FUCK. These 2 would drive out any comp from the other shit us vehicle companies (to be fair, Ford is also somewhat shit)

Ford was the Tesla of the early 1900s. The innovation parallels are long and distinguished. Long on Ford and Tesla.

Non-Driver Products - 13.6% (up 13.3% vs Last Quarter)

**\[Himax\] Forecast of Products:**

What I really wanted to focus on was their products and future guidance for Q4:

**LDDICS**

\+Q4: Revenue increase high single digits (QoQ)

\+Everyone in school/working at home on their laptops and shit) --> Increased monitor & notebook sales

\-Decline in TVs; As a result of COVID --> massive spike in TV buys from previous quarter so now everyone has a new ballin' TV

\+Himax’s Tcon revenue in the fourth quarter limited by capacity shortage in IC packaging due to competing demands from 5G chipsets is on track to increase by more than 20% (QoQ). This will represent more than 40% increase annually.

\*TCON = Timing controller

**SMDDIC**

\+Q4: revenue expected to increase double digits (QoQ) as demand > supply. Issue: capacity shortage which may not be resolved for a while.

\+Expected to gain market share in 2020 & 2021

\+Company's smartphone TDDI revenue is projected to have a nice double digit increase in Q4

\-Traditional display driver ICs for smartphone after spiking Q3 is set to decline double digit in Q4.

?Company highly invested in AMOLED technology and believes it will be a huge growth engine for SMDDIC business in 2021.

\+Tablet TDDI is ballin'. Increase of up to 80% (QoQ) expected for Q4. Believe it is a tremendous upside as Himax is a leading supplier for all major Android names.

\-Expected decline for tradition tablets QoQ, but still better than YoY previous numbers.

\+Car Panel Driver ICs hit hard by COVID, but recovering as car sales come back. Important to note: Much bigger gross margins on these and gradually bouncing back. More of these new technologies in place for 2021.

**Non-Driver Product Categories**

**WLO**

\-Declined as main customer lost sales, but will continue to produce

\+Still enaging and developing future generation products (ToF 3D sensing, waveguide for AR goggles, biomedical devices, and others)

**3D Sensing**

\+Targeting next gen Android phones

\+Few design wins from China's e-payment market actually, with shipments already starting in Q4

\+Working with customers for industrial robotics, smart door lock and home security, also.

**Ultralow power smart sensing**

\+Himax sees this as huge potential for the total package they hope to offer in the future. Just read the financial report because I'm getting lazy here

**CMOS Image Sensor**

\-Bad capped by foundry shortage, more when this shit ain't happening or gets better, chief

**\[Himax\] Future Guidance (Q4 2020):**

**Net Revenue**: To increase by around 10% (QoQ yet again, if you cucks can't tell by now).

\+This was their highest revenue in a single quarter in the past 12 years.

\+**Gross Margin**: To be around 29%, depending on final product mix. Previous Gross Margin by quarter:

2020 Q3 - 21.73%, 2020 Q2 - 20.96%, 2020 Q1 - 20.63%, 2019 Q4 - 20.57%

\-They have been much higher in the past. late 2000s.

this is steve's thesis on the share offering: "Offering when announced 10% dilutive but its growth capital so net accretive yet shares down 25%+. Doesn't make sense does it? Embrace opportunity. 1.2 billion population with only 2% online penetration"

First off, no fucking clue what he means by net 'accretive' so no it doesn't make sense, Steve...but sure a shit sounds like an attempt to convince the SEC that he's not manipulating the stock.

Second to the claims I understand:

\-**Steve's claim #2**: EMBRACE OPPORTUNITY

This is dumb, pollyannaish trash coming from someone who cannot come up with a good lie as to why he is manipulating the stock.

\-**Steve's claim #3:** 1.2 BILLION POPULATION WITH ONLY 2% ONLINE PENETRATION

This is a crazy lie to convince people that the market is less mature than it is and therefore we have to keep waiting for JMIA to figure out how not to throw cash into a fire pit.

A Doji is when a stock opens and closes at approximately the same price with less volatility than normal. This is that. Additionally, if you look at the volume it is up as sales, but the price is constant. This signals that whoever is buying is holding or putting in high limit orders.

Trust me, You don’t want to miss out


Overall:

Walmart’s new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon. They could become the future Amazon if the amount of people with Walmart Plus continues to grow. They should make a lot of money online during the Christmas season and pandemic and you should expect very high earnings going forward.

Walmart is making a push into the pharmaceutical sector, investing money into the space. They also announced a healthcare/ health insurance 
program recently. Health is an area of huge potential due to the Pandemic causing focus on the health sector.

Walmart is the largest retail store but was not affected to badly by the pandemic. Since they are the largest retail store you can except the stock to rise after the current restrictions on retail stores are lifted without having to worry about it falling with bad pandemic news.

Walmart is:
- A new online retailer with huge potential 

- Growing in the healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries

-Set up to make money distributing COVID vaccines

- The largest physical retail company in the world. (Physical retail is a sector that goes up a lot with good pandemic news)

These types of stocks are all stocks that people look at to find huge potential in growth. Walmart is really innovating and putting themselves in a position to grow a lot as a company over the next few years. There’s a chance that they will become the world largest online retailer and worlds largest Pharmacy along with them being the worlds largest physical retail company. That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.





Thing to read (references and today’s news):

My Findings:

1. Walmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).
Keep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. They might buy tiktok too which shows their open to new and risky strategies and innovation. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.

2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.


3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didn’t go down with covid does not mean they won’t go up when it goes away. I expect large gains in the stock once the pandemic is over. 



That took hours to write so I would appreciate it if you gave it an upvote and commented your thoughts :)

What do you think!?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cannabis stonks go brrrrrr _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dish hopefully loses 160+ channels tonight. DISH a satellite TV provider. They are up 42% this last month to $36.89. Today their contract expires with Nextar. They have been negotiating and claim Nextar is the devil and is raising prices too high. This could cause exponential customer loss, stock plummet.

Dish also got into a bidding war and overpaid for SPECTRUM wireless contracts they spent roughly 20 bn to aquire. This was earlier in the decade. However, the time is running out and they have yet to produce the build-out requirements for these by the FCC. The march 2020 deadline already passed and the next step is them failing to meet the 2023 deadline. They will face a 72 million dollar penalty should they fail.

The bull case here is that sprint and t-mobile merger failed and that Dish received an upgrade to Buy by some analysis because they predict Verizon may want to purchase these contracts for their network so that t-mobile does not obtain it.

Backstory, I have done work for Dish and they are horrible. Dish loses 671K customers annually. Currently with somewhere around 13.9 million. They also own Sling TV which is terrible and loses large amounts annually. The representatives that enter your home are micromanged into selling a minimum of $34 a job of upcharges on anything from HDMI Cables to full sound systems or smart home devices.

Dish has cut a huge amount of internal and external workforce this year amongst COVID-19 as well as raising the requirements for technicians to sell more. COVID may have brought in more temporary customers but with this blackout and more annual customer loss than their competitors I see this a potential shockwave into bear territory for the company if they fail to make a deal.

Something to keep an eye on, I would absolutely love to throw some PUTS on this one.

Update:
I spoke with “my guy” and he said it’s misleading somewhat. 160 channels is nationwide loss. A given area like Your Town May only lose a fraction of that amount based on what channels are with that provider in Your Town. 
He said it will cost a lot of money as dish then offers free over the air antennas with install (they’re usually like $120?) in this situation to compensate. That could hurt the profit margin depending on how wide of an area and how long this goes for. The customer usually pays $12.99 for locals so each customer receiving one could drop the local pack. 


They have already lost channels 8 and 23, and a couple others before today. I have yet to find out which channels are gone now or how the meeting went. 

Hope to see some gigantic drops on the stonk just because.

Update: “About 5.4 million Dish customers are being hit by the carriage impasse. Nexstar’s station portfolio now includes top markets like LA, Chicago and New York as well as dozens of other cities. Dish has about 9 million traditional satellite subscribers and another 2.5 million on its internet pay-TV bundle Sling TV.”

[5.4 million customers ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2020/12/dish-nexstar-blackout-carriage-dispute-wgn-america-1234636844/amp/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question for people who were trading stocks before 2020 I started trading stocks at around August. I've been letting myself in slowly, trying to keep a diverse portfolio, and sometimes taking some small risks like putting a little more on individual stocks etc, that are topical/historically solid, etc. I'm doing okay at the moment, but my feeling is that it's a very unique time in the stock market, where the world is pretty connected into one big thing at the moment. 

Like for me at least, its obvious to be investing in airlines right now as they're low currently and the world will eventually return to normal and even if that's not soon, they are guaranteed bailouts etc. But I feel like that's obvious because of the really weird situation we're in. 

My question: is 2020 and during the pandemic a very different kind of stock market? When the pandemic ends, does trading become more nuanced? Or is actually just because i wasn't in it before, that I didn't notice the more 'obvious' moves.

I hope this made sense lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, December 03, 2020 Your daily trading discussion thread. Please keep the shitposting to a minimum.

My hands are sore from jerking off your dad so I’ll make this brief. 

A cup and handle pattern is formed [during an existing uptrend ](https://imgur.com/a/W7YOBWS) which GME was certainly not in during 2019. A quick zoom out to the weekly chart [makes this pretty obvious.](https://imgur.com/a/H0kWHLI)

What you’re [seeing](https://imgur.com/a/XU9Hl08) is [basing](https://imgur.com/a/dsi8C5M), a period of consolidation where a downtrend stops but before the next uptrend begins. Very bullish if you catch the breakout, which was around $5.

The cup and handle pattern [has formed over the last 6 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/vHAWzv4) and is quite beautiful. However, if you’re playing this pattern you aren’t supposed to buy until it bounces back up and breaks the top of the cup. A lot of you have this cost base at $18-19 but got in too early and before the pattern is completed. If it completes the target is [around $26](https://imgur.com/a/WyKZZjI), though with other factors could be higher.

Godspeed soldier._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Gang Takes on Nat Gas I would like to dedicate this research to the oil trader that made a bill shorting Nat Gas after a hurricane and the kid in my stats class for igniting this idea.

Alright, listen up Fireman, Austismos, Goons, Gigolos, and Spooks alike we are taking on the Global Energy markets today. Skip to comments for TLDR. Our emphasis will be on how US Homes are heated. With patriotism and pandemic numbers in full swing, President-Elect Biden may attempt to slow the US Economy, pushing families into homes. Don’t debate this in the comments, debate if your local sheriff’s department has the funding and resources, and willingness to uphold this.

Let’s begin at your new favorite three-letter agency EIA; our journey with understanding and defining how the U.S. Energy Information Administration defines what makes up our statistics.

* **Residential** sector includes homes and apartments.
* **Commercial** sector includes offices, malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and places of worship, and public assembly.
* **Industrial** sector includes facilities and equipment used for manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction.
* **Transportation** sector includes vehicles that transport people or goods, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, boats, barges, and ships.

All global energy markets revolve around these sectors. With Petroleum (Oil for the Canadians) providing roughly 37%, Natural Gas 32%, Renewable 11% (kewk), Coal 11% (Trump 2020), and Nuclear at a dismal 8%. Honestly, side note why the fuck are homes still heated on Nat Gas, Electric and not Nuclear? Idk im retarded. Wait its because Nat Gas and Oil are big swinging dicks in this bracket. For those keeping score that’s +1 for Globalism and Capitalism, Science and Commies 0.

Data is a bit dated ;) at 2015 but it’s the best we got from the EIA

So moving along here you see Nat Gas and Electric as make up about 80% of the market. What provides that you ask?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ut1wcxdp4u261.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=76628660c9fba96d72f3f01ebb405cf83977bb41

Ok now, 44% of homes are heated with Natural Gas based energy which is highly efficient only consuming 16% of Nat Gas reserves, while 41% are heated by relying on the power grid; which is powered with an additional 36% of the United States Nat Gas. So in total United States homes consume about 52% of US Nat Gas markets.

Here is an [article](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45716) from the EIA starting to expect greater consumption this winter than in previous years. Posted Nov. 2, 2020

Within this article, they state we should expect consumers to spend 6% more on their winter bill than last winter. Also, producer costs are down 2% year over year. (lockdowns in cold climates were already in effect, for some of the “winter”)

Moving on to transportation and oil markets, 91% of transportation is powered by oil. Think, global shipping lines, domestic holiday shipping, domestic general goods shipping, and the biggest contributor that provides all of these things, airlines. Personally, I’m staying out of this portion due to a diverse set of market forces acting on global shipping markets. Tanker gang rises up tho.

Screenshot from EIA [article](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php) is shown above has Texas and Pennsylvania produce almost 40% of our Nat Gas

In conclusion and with the understanding that, United States Nat Gas companies out produce all other nations what are the tickers you want to look at?

Exhibit 2: GME share price vs time, see the 6m chart at https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/

The pattern is clear, every spike in price is coincident with more short interest opening up to drive the price lower, which works in the short term (<1 week timescale), but not further. My interpretation is that the spring is being compressed, but at big risk to the short sellers, is this incorrect?

You're throwing your money at people that barely type 10 words per minute. You're throwing your money at people that don't give a fuck about you, and use you as fuel for their endeavors.

We are the future and we literally control the internet. We see and process everything faster and better, and we have the power to control the trends. We are the literal work horses that get everything done and without us everything would crumble.

Yet you paper-ass handed nerds crumble at the second that a negative tweet comes out from an idiot old-fuck, or some dumb founded article from a worthless and jealous(MS) institute that literally no one uses or cares about.

You can track the drop in share price with the decrease of shortable shares.

That's when the price dropped from $28 to $25.   🌈 🐻 have basically exhausted the shortable shares, so I suspect we've hit the bottom (for now).

This morning Schwab notified me that they borrowed 18,300 shares. I wanted to do some option plays, but you can't since the shares are on "loaned." I called them up and told them to close the program.

Within 1 minute of transferring my shares back, PLTR started to go back up from the day's low of 21.50. I guess the shorters had to cover 18,300 shares?

PLTR to the moon!  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR downgrade So Keith Weiss, William and Mary graduate decided that good old MoStan needs a position in everyone’s favorite meme stock PLTR. In his reasoning behind the downgrade he said that “relative to their peers they are trading at an extraordinary multiple.”

I need us to combine our autistic powers (think like retard strength but with brain power)and figure out who he was talking about?

Thanks!

TLDR: who are Palantir’s peers he was referencing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You have to know when to pull out (even if you never do) So much loss porn today, on a day when the market is more or less flat. Why? Because of all of the PLTR bag holders. Yeah, some of you bought horrendously OTM short-term calls, sure, but some of you were people looking at 400% gains and you held because PLTR to the moon.

I keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.

I know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.

Loss porns were funny but I keep seeing "lost my life savings" or "gambled on significant margin" or "i used student loan payments for this" and it's really bumming me out. So either start using what little brain cells you have or at least leave out the context because I want to laugh at you without feeling bad.

1. Pick a SOLO theme and stick to your conviction.  
2. Buy calls months out.  
3. Split your buying up into bunches. If you wanted to buy $50k of something, buy $10k to start and buy $5k on every solid bounce in either direction (dip or boost) you see.  
4. Roll calls out a month ahead if shit isn't going your way yet.    
5. Have a target and be willing to pull out once you hit it or at least significantly scale back.   
6. Don't be afraid to walk away if shit clearly isn't working. How idiots stuck by NKLA after the truck rolling video is a good example here. Sure it worked for a little while longer, but the greed got crushed recently.  
  
  
Don't do weeklies unless you don't like your money. Don't follow random advice, it works sometimes it doesn't other times. Stick to your plan. Using OptionsProfitCalculator and other tools to see if it's even worth the risk is a good place to start. Asking yourself questions like is this even possible for this to do what I'm hoping it does - is a good place to start.

Hopefully you didn't completely wreck your account. What you need to do now is be smart about how you make your tendies back. There will be a few of you retards who get lucky with some FD's and make it back in two days but thats not going to work for all of you. 

What you need to do now is have a plan and know it might take a bit longer. IF you still believe in either of these companies, I mean actually have good understanding of their business and potential catalysts over the next 3-6-9 months then you should reposition into longer dated calls. You will have a good shot to make most of your money back. But it will take time. Don't hold onto your current piece of shit contracts. They are most likely going to 0. Also consider buying some stock. Again wont pay immediately but these companies can still do 100% moves over a relatively short period (6-12 months) or even faster. 

If your butt hole hurts so bad from this beat that the sight of NIO and PLTR gives your hemorrhoids then it's time to do the above strategy into a new ticker all together. Again don't sit on losers too long. If you can extract value do it, but have a plan before you sell anything. 

Anyway, I'm sure you all bought more FD's and will go bust by Friday. So DM me your wives number so I can take her out to Chili's and get a handjob in the bathroom.

Ackman also said, likely announcement of target will be in first quarter next year.

So with this info, I am quite sure PSTH will go down to $23 - $24 range in next few days.

My retarded suggestion is as follows:

If you have commons, sell covered calls for Dec / Jan, wheel it.
If you have dec calls, sell it
If you have jan calls, cover it with dec calls or sell it.
If you have march calls, cover it with jan calls.

Again, this is just an opinion from your retarded bro and I thought many times if I should make this post or not, but eventually decided to make one.

I had a average cost of $10 on Stock X with about 5k shares. Stock X goes up to $60. Then I set a stop loss at $40. It then executed. Is that a good or is that bad? In terms of tax? The stock was bought multiple times and averaged out to about $10. So, there are ST and LT gains that will be taxed. I then bought back in because I believe in the stock long term. Bought back in at $43. There is a $3 difference ($43 - $40 stop loss), so I essentially missed this $3 window. At 5k shares, with $3 difference in gain, this equals to $15k essentially "lost" opportunity, correct? 

Now, I buy back in fully with 5k shares again, my average is then now $43. Should I have done this?! or, just left it alone!? Analyst expects the stock to hit way above $60.

I'm not allowed to post my positions because rules but I like Hennessey and obviously hold some H🍆_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EASY MONEY MY FRIENDS 💰 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ According to my TA, stock go up _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNOWflake's business explained, no jargon  SNOWflake earnings come out today! Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.

I work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:

· Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. 

· Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.

This is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! 

Hope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!

* China (uses half of copper in the world) has recovered from the pandemic fully and has imported record amount of copper this year

* People speculate on EV companies like crazy but regardless of which EV companies end up dominating the market and which ones go bankrupt, copper wins.  Each electric vehicle uses 3.5 times more copper than combustion vehicle.  An electrical bus uses 11-16 times more copper than a conventional bus.   Super charger stations needs copper.  Any green infrastructure will require a lot of Cooper.

Goldman thinks copper price may break the 2011 record by second half of 2022.  https://www.ft.com/content/36fe5230-e24f-4fbf-8690-fd211f655347

So what to buy wise, I looked through a dozen big cap producers and jr miners.  Most  mine too many other metals and some own a lot of copper underground but digging up maybe a challenge for environmental/political reasons.  What's left are FCX, SCCO, and HBM.

Back in 2010-2011 when copper price broken record last, FCX traded over $56 ($23.68 right now), SCCO traded around $46 ($60.38 now so maybe not cheap), HBM traded around $17 ($6.78 now).

I have been buying FCX shares for 6 months, just started buying options last couple days.  Right now I have

* 2000 shares of FCX

* 50 contracts of HBM Jan21 7.5C

* 50 contracts of FCX Jan21 30C

* 20 contracts of HBM July21 10C

That's over $50K of positions in copper producers but I may buy some FCX leaps soon too.  The 2021 options maybe more of a moon shot unless copper price spikes a lot sooner than expected._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR: Tagging the major fib can't be ignored &#x200B;

Why?? Part of your margin agreement allows your broker to lend them out. Shorts borrow your shares and sell them. Effectively your own investments are being used against you. Even worse, your broker gets paid to do this. Currently the borrow fee on GME is 7%, but it was as high as 192% back in April:  
[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

If you own your shares for cash (no margin loan), you can ask your broker to move them from a margin account to a cash account. Others can chime in here too, but my understanding is if this happens, they are no longer lendable without your explicit permission.

This is the retail version of an institution recalling their shares from a lender. If they're no longer lendable, they're no longer shortable and if enough shares are held in cash, shorts are called to cover.

Im here today to talk to you about a company Im really hyped up about called **Momentus**.These guys are doing some really awesome shit out here providing last mile services for space transport, implementing new high-efficiency propulsion technologies for inter-planetary travel and shipping, and they’re positioning themselves to be in on the GROUND FLOOR of \*Permanent Space Infrastructure\* and the permanent space economy. These guys rule. This is the **first publicly traded space infrastructure company.**

Dont even fucking kid yourself about this: If human beings dont blow themselves into the stone ages, space is \*i n e v i t a b l e\*. We’re looking at $415Billion in revenue in the space industry currently, with Bank of America projecting the industry to expand upwards of $1.4Trillion in the near future.

As excited as I am about these guys, I’ll do what I can to give you the information I’ve been able to dig up so you can check em out and see if you're interested. I personally think they have some short term hype potential (which I’ll explain later) but Im buying calls now to lock in a price for this company to eventually exercise and hold for the full trip around the fucking moon

**Friends First: Momentus Confirmed Partners**

Currently, Momentus has confirmed and active partnerships or provides services to NASA, Lockheed Martin, and our favorite billionaire meme-lord papa Elon via Space X. They are already confirmed to be participating in the (hopefully) January 14th 2021 first-ever ride share rocket launch in partnership with Space X. They’re launching 4 different times with Space X in 2021 including an already-booked full vehicle in December of 2021 so they are already out there making plans and getting shit moving. Besides these big names there are many others they have current accounts and partnerships with including Global Ground Station, Relativity, Albaorbital, and others. And just as a little sugar on top, [the President of SpaceX prefers the types of space-tugs offered by Momentus over small rockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacex-president-prefers-space-tugs-over-small-rockets-2020-11-18) (wouldnt mind em giving me a lil space tug myself ifyanowutimsayin)

**The Men Behind the Mission**

The president and founder of Momentus is a man named Mikhail Kokorich. This guy was born in Siberia and studied physics in Russia where he finished his degree with honors while simultaneously starting a company. He has formed and headed several successful companies starting at age 19 with one that provided explosives and chemical services to Siberian mining companies. After that he founded and ran a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores, second in size only to Bed Bath & Beyond, successfully scaled and sold one of the largest consumer electronic retail chains as well as one of the biggest timber companies in the world.. He finally moved back to his childhood dream of building a space company. The rest of their team includes people with previous experience in aerospace, propulsion, and robotics as well as others. Plus, Mikhail is Russian and they beat the US into space so he’s already got a leg up. Also, Chris Hadfield (the astronaut that did an autistic David Bowie cover from the ISS) is on their Board of Directors, so thats pretty cool.

**The Company, The Vision, The Mission**

Momentus as a company currently has customers for space transportation services including last mile delivery, payload services that will decrease the costs across the board for launching and developing satellites, as well as fixing those puppies up and refueling them \*while they’re in orbit\*. They have a proven groundbreaking water propulsion technology that is significantly cheaper than any current offerings, is reusable, and is already working since a successful test flight in mid-2019 thats still going to this day. **No pushing the satellite down a hill and turning the camera bullshit here.** They put their money where their mouth is and shot that fucker into space just to prove they could, and its **still going.** Currently they have >$90M of signed contracts and 4 confirmed Vigoride (thats what they’ve named their first model) launches on Space X Flacon-9s. They already have a product roadmap with 3 different models to be offered by 2024 providing both small satellite all the way up to 20,000kg transportation. They will have limited commercial launches starting in the first half of 2021 with full commercial launches going live by Q4 2021. They are compatible with Space X, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, and Relativity with active launch deals signed with all except Blue Origin currently. They’re also in negotiations for over $1.1B of contracts including with NASA and the US government. Companies like Starlink, Amazon, Apple, and Google already have plans to create their own satellite networks and Momentus is the first in line with proven technology to service all of these future plans with big and long lasting tech players. They have a clear path to profitability and >$1B in EBITDA. Lastly, they’re already looking to the future and working on plans for in-space solar energy generation, water and resource harvesting from asteroids and other planetary bodies, as well as all sorts of other cool sci-fi shit that (I hope) humans will be capable of before Im fucking dead.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**Momentus is a bleeding-edge space infrastructure and technology company with a successful and passionate founder, a proven currently-in-space revolutionary water propulsion technology, active partnerships with Space X, NASA, and others, and already have good finances and a clear path to profitability and growth. They’re going public via a special purpose acquisition company with an enterprise value of $1.2B which will later be relisted under the ticker $MNTS.

Momentus was founded by a Russian (the first country in space), already has working partnerships with Papa Elon, and wants to build a future where getting to and moving around in space is cheap, renewable, and profitable. This guys are [going to the fucking moon and back several times on a tiny, water-propellled 🚀 with or without you](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005408/en/Momentus-Announces-First-Rideshare-Mission-to-Moon), so I’d suggest you grab a seat early and hold on tight

The CEO came out yesterday with swaggy updated guidance, and earnings are two weeks from today. So while there might not be any 20% days for this one, look for it to keep chugging quietly up in advance of that.

Bear case is that Cramer likes it.

Short term calls for a run up look good imo, low 70s by next week easy.

PFE or Pfizer is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and ranked 57 on the 2018 [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500) list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. They have a 226.2 BILLION dollar market cap.

They make  Lipitor which all of us probably need after yoloing our life savings into PLTR.They also make a drug our wife's boyfriends routinely dont need -Viagra

But the biggest question I have... why arnt we riding PFE to TendieTown.They literally are a massive pharma company with experience dealing in international regulations..Theyve partnered with BionTech and just got APPROVAL to use their COVID VACCINE IN THE UK NEXT WEEK

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696)

Literally even Delta is riding their wave back to life  and have altered flights to deliver their vaccine by storing it in dry ice.

Moderna went up 70% to 170$ and only dipped because of serious profit taking because Merck cashed out at like a 650% gain (i think i saw they made over a billion in gainz)

PFE and Moderna are safe bets. PFE a safer bet. Look at headlines. Literally the governors of California and North Carolina have already said how thankful and blessed they are that they are getting a few hundred thousand vaccines from Pfizer and Illinois is about to follow suit.

PFE literally has a meeting for vaccine drug approval with the FDA on December 10.They are experienced, they are financially secure, and they are already making and distributing the vaccine. UK already approved their vaccine, the FDA will follow suit and PFE will make us serious money.

Im all in with my small account.25 contracts at 45$ strike price with an expiration date of 12/18 and

**Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.** 

1) **Develop software for Grid for trading electricity** \- 

Name is “Autobidder”. The grid you’re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn’t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)

Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You’ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. 

&#x200B;

2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **–** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you’ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you’re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. 

Since Sun doesn’t shine at night, and sometimes it’s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla’s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla’s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla’s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. 

&#x200B;

3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage –** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you’ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn’t buy a house that doesn’t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. 

4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs –** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It’s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it’s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. 

&#x200B;

The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who’d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that’s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they’re building from scratch. 

&#x200B;

**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that’s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it’s laughable generally to even think something like “we’re gonna make our own business software”. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don’t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   
   
 

**6)** **Selling Insurance Products –** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance “an auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business”. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you’re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They’re currently offering it in California only. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines –** As per Elon, he doesn’t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they’re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it’s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They’ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn’t know anything about vaccines? Well, he’s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac – a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   
   
 

**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles –** Oh no…Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren’t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they’re building. Don’t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories –** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn’t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you’ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla’s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn’t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won’t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   
   
 

**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) –** So we’re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you’re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla’s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn’t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with “better chip” next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla’s range doesn’t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let’s not even talk about compute

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- "Tesla Dojo"** **-** So this is something the industry hadn’t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   
   
 

**12)**  **Mine lithium –** Hold your horses, it’s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they’ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they’ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they’ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. 

&#x200B;

**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries –** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They’re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won’t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla’s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won’t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.

**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**

I have posted quite a few times on vale and wanted to post yet again for another perspective that has formed about its future.

Vale has been on a bull run with the rest of the market, the sentiment is that Vale is working out a deal with TSLA over supplying nickel for the car batteries that elon musk is going to be producing; I got to thinking exactly how much will vale be getting in revenue and wanted to crack down on some numbers with some assumptions added in, If tesla is set to manufacture 500,000 cars this year and each battery cost on average 10-12k, we can assume that half if not less is for the materials of producing the batteries and then the rest is either markup or for labor; So taking some rough numbers, 5k$ x 500,000 cars is 2.5 Billion USD for the year.. Good chunk of change! but is it enough to push vale to new highs?

Vale currently trades around $15.50 a share, and looks like it will push around 75 billion in revenue, currently at a market cap of 82 Billion dollars and a net income looking around 20 billion for the year after 4th quarter reports later.

TSLA will definitely add some value, but what valuation would be reasonable to aim for? 100 billion market cap? 120 billion market cap? or perhaps is an 80 billion market cap a fair price as of right now and in the near future.

&#x200B;

I am bullish on this stock, I think that as TSLA grows and the EV market grows, so will opportunity for nickel/iron miners.. But I see road bumps in the near future and would like to get some thoughts on this.

(5800 shares from $5.75)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Roblox - A first look into valuation before the IPO With news of a Roblox IPO, I decide to dive into this company to see what the hype is about. When Roblox was first brought to my attention, I thought they were some sort of gimmick legos. Full disclosure, I have never played this game, but I did play Runescape many, many years ago. Chopped the hell out of some Yew trees. This makes me not the least qualified to gauge Roblox as a video game, but we are gauging its potential as a stock instead.

   

* Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds
* Roblox plans to IPO before Christmas, so we take a look at the rumored valuation of $8bn
* Covid-19 has generated a huge boost to traffic with Daily Active Users ((DAUs)) growing 82%, hours engaged growing 122%, revenue growing 68%, bookings growing 171%, and a large $292.6 mm in free cash flow in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020
* The valuation story depends on Roblox's ability to continue growing once the Covid pandemic is in the rear-view mirror

**Roblox Business and Technology:** Roblox was founded in 2003 and has hit many milestones before the planned IPO launch. The most important recent developments being the Joint Venture with Tencent to establish Roblox China and re-launching Roblox Premium to develop a subscriber base with steadier cash flows.

The Roblox business model is based on the underlying technology and infrastructure that support the 31.1 million average DAUs. Roblox defines a DAU as "a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day" [(source: company S-1)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm). 

This business is based on three elements:

* **Roblox Client:** The underlying app that allows users to explore 3D worlds
* **Roblox Studio:** The toolset that enables developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D      experiences and content 
* **Roblox Cloud:** The services and infrastructure that power the platform

[We think this is what Roblox players do, but we can't be sure](https://preview.redd.it/cw6x1j3dwr261.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=351745b196e484eca18f7a959dcc73cddb178c70)

The Roblox platform and the key technology characteristics are as follows:

* Identity: The Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. There are a wide variety of character styles.
* Friends: The Roblox Client allows users to connect through various means, including detecting nearby players or meeting in the Roblox world. The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud. The Roblox Platform supports text-based chat among users sharing the same 3D experience and between users connected through the social graph.
* Immersion: The Roblox platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share experiences.
* Low friction: Users have the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular      client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. When a user joins an online experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on the user’s social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. 
* Variety of content: Roblox provides developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. **Developers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform.** Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates. There were over 18 million experiences on Roblox as of Sept 30, 2020.
* Global: The Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the nine months ended September 30,      2020, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed the platform.
* Economy: Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased.      Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content or by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. 

[Robux, the currency of the online Roblox world, buying options](https://preview.redd.it/ob8nmkdrwr261.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d00a16cb7c44c1d36329ef4692f1d85cd3b309)

**Developer Incentives:** With nearly the entire Roblox online universe being built by the ingenuity of developers and creators, Roblox has developed a system to incentivize natural development expansion.

Roblox currently offers developers and creators four ways to earn Robux:

* The sale of access to their experiences and enhancements to these experiences
* Engagement-based payouts - rewarding developers for the amount for time that Premium subscribers spend in their experiences
* The sale of content and tools between developers
* Sale of items to users through the Avatar marketplace

As users purchase and spend their Robux on Roblox, developers receive 70% of the Robux spent within their experiences and 70% of the items that appear in the Studio marketplace. Creators receive 30% of the Robux spent for their items on the Avatar marketplace.

[ Example of a store from Mining Simulator by Runaway Rumble within Roblox  ](https://preview.redd.it/ll886iywwr261.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=a297ebec391df538a2db9c580294c677a6b2d7c3)

These earned Robux are deposited into virtual accounts where developers can convert Robux into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1 Robux to $0.0035. In the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020, developers and creators earned $209.2 mm, up from $72.2 mm in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2019. Clearly, the Roblox developers and creators are also benefiting from the massive spike in users on Roblox.

**Current Roblox Business Profile:** When users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of experiences for free, although the business model for any experience is ultimately up to the developer. Users can purchase Robux either as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service billed monthly. 

For one-time purchases, users can purchase the virtual currency through various channels including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, credit cards, prepaid cards, Microsoft app store, PayPal, and others. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 34% and 18% of Roblox revenue was generated on Apple App Store and Google Play Store, respectively. For operations through both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, Roblox must pay the customary 30% to Apple or Google. 

Roblox has managed to rapidly expand its DAU base. 

&#x200B;

[source: Company and our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/tgm7pzjzwr261.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bea9ab82d310c938dc0fff317a4ecbbb37ba47)

Roblox has grown its DAU count by 94.9% and 96.9% in Q2 and Q3 of this year, respectively. DAUs are up in every geographic region with the Rest of the World segment growth being particularly impressive. However, Roblox acknowledges that this upsurge in growth during the pandemic may not be sustainable when they say, "We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods" (source: company S-1).

The growth profile and future look of Roblox as an attractive investment hinges on their ability to keep the surge in DAU growth they've experienced as a result of the pandemic and then continue to grow their DAUs (albeit at a slower pace compared to 2020).

The DAU metrics show that 55.6% of DAUs in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020 are under the age of 13. 

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/cyhv0lh2xr261.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a85667c88551495acbff9c346b7ea71da5cbdd)

DAUs drive spending, and Roblox has seen the average bookings per DAU increase as well. Bookings are defined as "equal to the amount of virtual currency purchased by users in a given period of time" (source: company S-1). Therefore, we can expect bookings to be the most widely watched metric every quarterly earnings release, not revenue. DAUs and average bookings per DAU growth are the primary drivers in our valuation model.

**Roblox Cost Profile:** The major Roblox operating costs consist of 

* Cost of revenue - 3rd party payment processing such as Apple and Google app stores - 12.5% of Bookings YTD
* Developer exchange fees - amount earned by developers and creators on the Roblox platform - 16.9% of Bookings YTD
* Infrastructure - Data centers and technical support - 19.8% of Bookings YTD
* R&D, G&A, and Sales and marketing - 19.8% of Bookings YTD

As you can see from the chart above, the Loss from Operations has widened significantly the past 4 quarters. However, this is slightly misleading because the company is cash flow positive and the company has been generating more cash flow, not less.

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/ub0dbvdaxr261.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=0052285a3da1637689665e1708d86cf482402877)

The reason for this is the method the company uses to recognize revenue vs bookings. On revenue recognition, "We generally recognize revenue from users ratably over the average lifetime of a paying user, which for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 was 23 months. Therefore, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of purchases of Robux during previous periods" (source: company S-1). And bookings - "Substantially all of our bookings are generated from sales of our virtual currency **which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user**" (source: company S-1).

[source: Company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/zoad08rcxr261.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a9d7615a3cf3cbd3f35779c598ddf9e97f9fd9)

**So these accounting losses don't necessarily matter** because the company is free cash flow positive. As we can see in the table of bookings and revenue, revenue as a % of bookings declined from 70% in 2019 to 38.4% and 48.8% in Q2 and Q3 2020 respectively. 

**Roblox Growth strategy:** Roblox is focused on four core strategies in order to achieve growth:

* Platform extension: Roblox is continually investing in the platform including in avatars, experiences, technology, and other social features. These efforts can further drive bookings per DAU.
* Age demographic expansion: Roblox and developers are working on building higher quality experiences      and content that appeal to an older age demographic. These efforts can drive DAU growth as well as bookings per DAU as older people don't have to beg mom and dad for their credit card.
* International growth: The JV with Tencent in China is a testament to Roblox's ability to grow      internationally into new markets.
* Further monetization: Roblox is working with their developer community actively to help improve      monetization. Efforts such as Roblox premium being introduced in August 2019 as well as working with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities on the Roblox platform can further drive monetization.

**Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming Market:** The MMO market has increased rapidly and has hit over 16 million total players. ([source](https://mmo-population.com/charts/players)) We take a look at the market's growth to get a sense of the growth that Roblox may be able to achieve in the near future and beyond. The total number of players dipped in 2019, but the trend is clear with around a 28.5% CAGR in total MMO players over the past 3 years.

[ Source: https:\/\/mmo-population.com\/charts\/players  ](https://preview.redd.it/1u289h9jxr261.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=42b6b45ae0f250d7b671e39c015c3191a4d818de)

We also take a look at the MMO arguably most similar to Roblox, Minecraft. Minecraft is owned by Microsoft and they have released intermittent data points on the number of active players on the platform. The number of active players on Minecraft has increased from 40 million in June 2016 to 126 million as of May 2020. We have only 5 total data points in this time-frame, but this indicates a 33% CAGR over the period and it has accelerated from October 2018 to May 2020. Can Roblox experience a similar level of growth in active players?

**Roblox Forecast:** The basis of our valuation is Bookings per user growth, DAU by region growth, and expenses as a % of Bookings.

Bookings per User have grown 68.6% and 52.5% in Q2 and Q3 y/y, respectively. We think they continue to grow at a high pace in Q4 and Q1 of next year. However, growth will then decelerate as the populations are vaccinated and people start to live their lives as normal once again, thus removing a tailwind for online gaming.

&#x200B;

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/65tv0bgoxr261.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e840ee21dfd46a6fe29407791fedf8d2124640)

We have Bookings per user growing 20.6% in 2021, 10% in 2022, 7.5% in 2023, and 5% in subsequent years. For example, this deceleration in each DAU spend gives us a quarterly spend on over $20 a quarter in 2024.

DAUs have grown rapidly during the pandemic, and likewise we expect this growth to decelerate as the pandemic draws to a close. We forecast that Roblox will consolidate its Covid user-base gains, and grow an additional 12.5% in DAUs in 2021, 7.5% in 2022, and 5% every subsequent year. This means that Roblox will pass 50 million DAUs in 2024 and will have close to 60 million in 2030.

We forecast that Roblox's costs and expenses will increase, but as a result of scaling will decrease as a % of Bookings in the future. We anticipate that Roblox will be able to consolidate its cost profile so far experienced in 2020 and will have a cost profile \~60% of Bookings in the future, with the largest contributors to cost being cost of revenue, developer exchange fees, and infrastructure where it is more difficult to create efficiencies through scale.

For some scenario analyses of what the company bookings will be in 2025, we look at different ranges of DAU growth and Bookings per user growth. Roblox currently has averaged 31.1mm DAUs in 2020, and we run scenarios from 22mn to 92mm DAUs in 2025. Likewise, we grow average bookings anywhere from 0% to 17.5% a year. We estimate the likeliest bookings range to be $2.9bn to $5.4bn in 2025, compared to the estimated $1.8bn in bookings for full-year 2020.

**Valuation:** We value Roblox through a Discounted cash flow model with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% and a perpetual growth rate of 4%. With these assumptions, we get an equity value per share of around $26.50. With the rumors of Roblox seeking a valuation of \~$8bn [(source)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/technology/roblox-is-all-but-guaranteed-a-blockbuster-ipo-15496912), we get 114% upside.

Just for fun, we run a scenario where we give Roblox decrease DAUs -5% and give 0% growth in bookings per DAU, while keeping the same cost profile, for the final three quarters of 2021 (when the pandemic winds down). We then grow at an anemic rate in DAUs in the future, 5% in 2022 and 2.5% a year onward, we get a price target of \~$18.30 and an equity value close to $12bn.

**Risks to our View:**

Younger audience: With 55.6% of DAUs under the age of 13, how likely is it that they stay on the Roblox platform, we don't have a definitive answer. Kids so young move to the next hottest game very easily and quickly and therefore it is crucial that Roblox continue to capture and keep their attention in order to grow their DAU count.

MMO gaming market competition: An extension of the first risk, the MMO gaming market is incredibly competitive and Roblox will need to continue to innovate and develop its platform to stay ahead of the competition. We aren't aware of any new releases that directly challenge Roblox's position as one of the most widely played games in the world, but new video games and revamps of old games happen all the time. We look forward to seeing how Roblox continues to differentiate itself in the gaming market from competitors and whether these efforts will be successful.

Inability to consolidate Covid user-base gains: Once the pandemic ends will the majority of DAUs gained no longer play Roblox or play/spend less? Our model assumes that the company is able to keep the majority of its DAUs and continue to grow, but this is truly a risk without a real precedent.

**TLDR;** This stock has a very positive story and a lot of price upside if Covid-induced growth can be consolidated and future growth can be achieved. We look to the pricing of the IPO.

Let's all win money today,

Nightman_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why analyst ratings should be taken with a grain of salt, an analysis of J.P. Morgan's NKLA analyst Paul Coster So, the GM MoU with NKLA gets published yesterday and the stock tanks.
This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

"We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger," Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/3de4184e223f46448f8f09bdf66a2e4e.html?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&_v=1&theme=2&color=1&hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it “a compelling strategy.”However, Coster also points out Nikola’s near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.“We think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,” Coster said. “Failure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviously… For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.”Coster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/)
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost come to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesn’t give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I don’t know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market.

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don’t disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB trade idea. A theta gang approach. Here’s my plan on how I’m gonna trade $BB. The post will have paragraphs cause fuck those that don’t use paragraphs. 

So, You see $BB all over the place and feel like FOMOing into calls. Here’s a better approach.

Instead, I’m going to sell a cash secure put or even sell it on margin (since the margin requirement are trivial, TD requires $75 margin!) at the $7.5 strike for the Jan 15th expiration. 

It was trading yesterday at $160, probably lower at market open today since BB is up 18%. Maybe even consider the $9 strike.

The reason being is that the IV is skyrocketing; currently at 130% and IV rank is at 60% meaning that this current level of IV is higher than 60% of the historical IV in the past year. 
Let’s see what the maximum gains and potential risks are:

If BB continues ripping, the put will expire worthless and i get to keep the credit and return about 200% on margin held.

If BB stays flat, the IV will crush ( known as reverting to the mean) will tank the premium of the puts which then i can buy back cheaper. 

If BB goes bankrupt and trades at $0 (unlikely but let’s assume maximum risk), max loss would be ($7.5-$0)*100= $750. 
But credit received is about $160 in credit, so $750-$160= $590. That’s the maximum loss in case BB goes to zero which isn’t gonna happen.

TLDR; instead of buying calls and paying for the insane IVs to subsequently get fucked by IV crush, sell a cash secured put._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRWD will kill it CRWD has been one of the favorite SAAS Stocks of the year. 

Consensus estimates expect $214.36M in revenue and breakeven profit. Last quarter, CRWD guided $210.6-215M in revenue and a loss per share of $0.01 to $0.

They have beaten both revenue and EPS 100% of the time in the last 4 quarters and my belief is they’ll do that again today AH.

Oh yeah, house votes on legalizing Cannabis today which should pass.  May get killed in the Senate unless the dems win the GA Senate runoffs in January which is a possibility especially with the Trump supporters wanting to boycott the GA runoff elections as they feel disenfranchised with Trump's loss in GA.  

On top of which, Mexico's senate voted to legalize weed last week and they need to make a decision by 12/15 so there's another vote in the lower chamber this week or next to make it happen.

And Thailand recently legalized it (like last week!)  Why is that big?  Because ASIA is huge!  Where do you think we shipped all of our cigarettes after it became unfashionable here in the states?  Those guys literally wrote the book on sin and excess.  Why do you think so many dorky white men fly to thailand?  For the massaman curry?

And, "The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on Wednesday accepted a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to remove cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs."

It's already totally legal in 15 states, medicinally legal in 20 more, and decriminalized in 10 more beyond that.  https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state


TLDR; lots of catalysts happening on the weed front.  it will legalize eventually.  make your bets.  2021 will be a banner year for weed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JPMorgan published the article that said Nikola’s 25% dive is a good buying opportunity, let’s look at that claim ***Papa Elon warned us on twitter about EV SPACs.***

When someone tells you to buy a stock without a large DD to help their argument **do not buy.**

 **The 25% sell-off in Nikola on Monday represents a good buying  opportunity for investors as the company is no longer distracted by its  Badger pickup truck, JPMorgan said.** 

 **"We think this is a positive outcome for NKLA over the medium to  longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck  initiative," JPMorgan said.** 

**NIKOLA TRE**

**Financial Times and Wall Street Journal** both confirmed the rumor that Nikola signed a contract with Romeo Power to use their batteries in the Tre 

The Tre is the only way they have to get something on the road. They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. 

 So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. 

 There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. 

 The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. 

 In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. 

 But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh 

So they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. 

**NIKOLA TWO**

It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph 

Nikola Two For those who don't know, that's the two trucks that they had Bosch design and build for them a couple of years ago. 

He claimed that it could do 0-60 in under five seconds, when anyone could see it took at least 10 seconds. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)

1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. 

2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  

3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  

4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  

Two speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. 

Nikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  

The truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph. No wonder it's parking lot only. 

There is ONE time we did see the Two driving kind of fast. It's in a video called, predictably, "Nikola Two in Motion". The video description is almost a word for word copy of that of the famous video of the One rolling down the hill.

Executive Summary: Market has wrongly placed PTON into a COVID basket of stocks which would see demand and growth disappear once a vaccine is developed and life goes "back to normal".  Bears believe demand will disappear, everyone will cancel their accounts and the bikes will end up on eBay.  They are wrong. Below are the reasons why the bears have it wrong.

&#x200B;

* PTON revenue 2017 - 2020 and 2021(company projection):  Y/Y 100% gains.  Starting well before COVID.  Working out at home was already a trend.  Think of all the Instagrammers who were starting their own workout pages and charging membership for basic production value instruction. Enter PTON a professional plan and revenue starts growing.  When COVID comes it accelerated the demand and PTON is now about 4 years ahead of their own projections and accelerating.
   * 2017 $218M
   * 2018 $435M  +100%
   * 2019 $915M  +110%
   * 2020 $1,826M +100%
   * 2021 (est.) $4,000M+  +119%
* Massive Lead in interconnected fitness space. No significant competitor into this new space.
* Premium Product and experience.  Works as expected.  Intuitive. Addictive. Measured performance. Results.
* Cult like enthusiasm amount users.
* Demand outpacing supply - Building additional capacity to address this very real issue.  Wait times for delivery can exceed months.
* Celebrity exclusive artists. Exclusive access to superstars.
* Growing class usage - artist classes with over 300,000 riders.  massive social movement.  Think of over 4 average football stadiums combined.  Each day classes get bigger. Costs stay same.
* Social power of audience size.  Large Data opportunity. Potential marketing opportunity.
* Subscriber base is growing and still small given the TAM.   Q1 ending Connected Fitness Subscriptions grew 137% to over 1.33 million and paid Digital Subscriptions grew 382% to over 510,000; total Members grew to over 3.6 million.
* Used by celebrates, athletes, trainers, and everyday people.
* Patented experience. 8 separate patents on the bike, 5 on the treadmill.
* Increasing manufacturing capabilities and building out flagship spaces in major cities. Branding very strong.
* Profitable in last 2 quarters - expected to have 4th quarter of profit at 3/31/2021.
* Consideration for S&P 500 inclusion in 2021.
* Price: $40 per month is a bargain compared to in person cycle classes that can be $20-$40 per single class depending on the market.  The membership is good for two people.  With more equipment in the future the membership becomes even more efficient.  Bike costs are fixed and financeable.
* Work from Home thesis.  I see working from home as a new normal.  Those that have jobs where it is possible to work from home have adjusted and found ways to perform remotely. They have gained time with their own family and found time that was otherwise wasted in a commute.  Working from home is very efficient and green.  Companies will adjust.  Commercial real estate is hollowing out at an incredible rate.
* Investment commitment.  When someone pays $2,000 for a product they are invested.  I see this as another sticky point.
* People get used to their favorite trainers.  They follow them online and connect with them.
* Tags are used for community.
* Ride with friends.
* Multiple products.  Aside from Bike, there is stretch, strength, core, outside running, treadmill running, yoga, Pilates, meditation, etc.  This is not a one trick pony and the more a user is engaged the more valuable the subscription becomes.
* Additional Markets - PTON has not entered the eastern markets.  They have barely started to enter the US market.
* New products.  Bike and Bike+.  New treadmill to be released soon.
* Apparel Line
* Healthcare case.  Health is more important than ever.  Potential partnerships with medical providers that could subsidize membership and product as part of premium.
* Intersection of existing business models.  AAPL - Product.  FB - Social Community. NFLX - Subscription.
* Average analyst price target remains around $135. Top target is $160.

TL/DR.  Lots of ways for PTON to win. Fears of demand disappearing after a vaccine are unfounded.

Position - Long Shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ From the Scientist who posted the NVAX DD: Updates about recent COVID Vaccine news and today's price action for $NVAX & $MRNA I've gotten numerous questions about what to make of the last few trading days for $NVAX, as well as $MRNA and $BNTX so I thought it might be useful to give an update on recent developments in the COVID vaccine race and how I'm interpreting them. 

I've already made two long posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/)) about why I think NVAX is the best vaccine stock and as of today have over 60k invested in stocks/options (proof at the end) so I'm not gonna try to pretend that I'm not biased towards NVAX. 

But with that in mind, I still thought this might help NVAX/MRNA/BNTX holders because I think the next month is gonna to be crazy for all three stocks (less so PFE/JNJ/AZN) and I don't know of too many good sources of information for the typical retail investor.

&#x200B;

**Today's action**

https://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498

I think today was just a pullback from the big moves over the last few days bc I couldn't find anything that would have cause all three stocks to drop. Please let me know if I'm missing something.

Although all three stocks followed the same pattern at the start of the day, MRNA's selloff seemed to accelerate right around 12:30pm, which coincided with an interview of Moderna's President Stephen Hoge as part of the Evercore ISI annual health conference ([webcast link](https://wsw.com/webcast/evercore11/mrna/2356374); requires name and email to view video). I don't know if the two things are related, but comments he made during the interview were picked up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2

Whether or not I'm overinterpreting the two events, there were a couple of important things that came up during the interview that might be of interest for MRNA holders:

1. In my first post, I talked about how the 95% efficacy for MRNA that's been widely circulated only refers to prevention of symptomatic disease and not prevention of infection. Well this was the opening topic and I wonder whether this was the first time some people realized that the reported 95% efficacy didn't refer to infections and prompted an overreaction. I think Hoge did a good job in navigating the questions and made it clear that they'll be reporting that data as a secondary endpoint from the trial.
2. Manufacturing capacity was another big topic and Hoge said that the upper end of the 500M to 1B doses they're estimating for 2021 isn't going to happen unless everything goes perfectly. He said that the 500M estimate was more reasonable and to my ear seemed to be hedging quite a bit, making me question whether 500M is going to be difficult to achieve.
3. They expect to have 20M doses by the end of the year
4. No safety issues have been observed and we know that the vast majority of safety issues with other vaccines present within the first few weeks (can't remember the exact timeframe).

&#x200B;

[This](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s) was the only other thing that I could find that may have impacted NVAX/MRNA/BNTX:

https://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242

I haven't spent a lot of time talking about JNJ, as their Phase 3 trial was halted in October due to a case of transverse myelitis and everything I've read suggests that they're not going to be able to apply for emergency use authorization until mid-1Q 2021. I have to get more caught up on JNJ to figure out the implications of their progress, but my impression until now has been that they're behind. That however might not be the case outside of the US, and if so, maybe this news was relevant for NVAX/MRNA/BNTX. I'm skeptical bc I saw almost zero discussion of this, but I think it warrants some consideration. 

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Important Upcoming Catalysts

&#x200B;

**Emergency use authorization announcements**

https://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db

[Link](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article247526955.html). I think this is just an attempt to reassure the public that they're not going to take any shortcuts. I think it's extremely unlikely that both of the mRNA vaccines don't get emergency use authorization given their high efficacy rates and reportedly good safety profiles in the middle of a pandemic. We'll know based on the AdComm meetings on December 10th for PFE/BNTX and December 17th for MRNA. 

This is obviously a positive catalyst for MRNA/BNTX, but I have no idea how much they'll run-up to the announcement and how much of them getting approval is already priced in. As far as how this impacts NVAX, I think we might see a small pullback if positive announcements but I honestly have no idea what will happen. I tend to think this won't matter much for NVAX since it's been clear for a long time that they're behind PFE/MRNA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines** 

Something that I think is completely off the radar but I think is going to be a huge deal within the next month is the fact that mRNA vaccines have significantly more reactogenicity than the vaccines most people are used to. Reactogenicity includes symptoms like injection site pain, swelling, fever, and fatigue; symptoms that are unpleasant but not dangerous. 

If you're an investor in MRNA/BNTX, don't shrug this off. This [article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022) published in Science is what convinced me there's trouble ahead and this can't be ignored:

https://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39

Here are a couple of quotes from the article:

&#x200B;

>... after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a “goose egg,” ...  within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9°C fever. “I started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,” he says. “**I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: ‘Should I call 911**?’”   
>  
>  
>  
>Hutchison's symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, “**Nobody prepared me for the severity of this**.” He says the public should be better prepared than he was, because a subset of people may face intense, if transient, side effects, called reactogenicity, from Moderna's vaccine. Some health experts agree.   
>  
>  
>  
>“**Somebody needs to address the elephant**: What about vaccine reactogenicity? While it's … not going to cause any long-term issues … how is that perception going to go with the public once they start receiving it?” asks Deborah Fuller, a vaccinologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, whose lab is developing second-generation RNA vaccines against COVID-19. She worries the side effects could feed vaccine hesitancy. “**I feel like it's being glossed over**.”   
>  
>  
>  
>Most people will escape “severe” side effects, defined as those that prevent daily activity. Fewer than 2% of recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed severe fevers of 39°C to 40°C. But if the companies win regulatory approvals, they're aiming to supply vaccine to 35 million people worldwide by the end of December. **If 2% experienced severe fever, that would be 700,000 people.**   
>  
>  
>  
>Hausman also sees a need to support people who have serious reactions. **For example, people may need “a hotline with a nurse triaging …** **figuring out if you need to go to the hospital or not. Will your medical expenses be covered if you do?** These are important questions.” 

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to contribute to fear mongering or indirectly help my NVAX investment by highlighting this (although these issues are part of what made me invest in NVAX in the first place). That's all from an article published in Science which would be one of the last sources that would ever be interested in reducing vaccine acceptance.

The bottom line is the US, vaccine skepticism and misinformation - particularly about COVID vaccines - is higher than ever. What's going to happen once the people being injected aren't clinical trial participants and instead include people that are reluctant/skeptical? Even if the rate of severe reactogenicity is only 1%, that's going to be a lot of sources for news stories "about new untested mRNA vaccines" and a lot people sharing horrible experiences on social media if millions get vaccinated. 

I think this could hit BNTX/MRNA hard if it becomes a big story line. Still probably some gains to be had in the runup to the EUA announcement, but I would be real careful if I was holding options once we get further into December and the probability of this as a story line increases.

&#x200B;

**NVAX + Positions update**

Assuming the below screenshot supposedly from JPM is [real](https://twitter.com/MaxSpeculation/status/1333956816187875328/photo/1) (I can't find the original source), NVAX lowered the interim update trigger from 66 events to 50 events in their Phase 3 UK trial, which means we'll get the interim update sooner that what was originally stated in the clinical trial protocol. Their head of R&D said they'd do this last week, so I suspect this is legit but no guarantees.

In case you're not familiar, the interim update is when we'll get the first readout on efficacy. If it's good (90-95%) then I think the stock goes up massively. So I'll be holding through that announcement pretty much no matter what happens from here on out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8

&#x200B;

If you're holding options that expire on December 18th, then I might consider rolling them to January bc it will be cutting it close. My plan is to actively trade the December options and keep building my core position in January calls so I give myself enough breathing room for the announcement in case it doesn't come in December. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782

I rolled a lot of gains from the last few days into these positions, so even though today I gave a lot back, I'm still up significantly since I started this trade. The reason for the weeklies is that NVAX has a couple of investor meetings coming up in the next two days and I think this rebounds.

Called BABA at 255 a few weeks back, and PLUG at the end of October. I know the sub-species of idiots who exist on this sub need to earn some money to later lose on OTM calls for high-risk small cap companies that are at all time highs. I’m here to provide. 

There is no better purchase then Saleforce tomorrow, we are below all moving short &amp; long averages, and we of course have had another unprecedented crash on amazing news. Providing a wonderful opportunity for you idiots to buy in at an absolute low, when the company will be at all time highs within the next two months. 

I know some dumb cunts are going to be like “well their future outlook isn’t looking as good as we wanted” I’m here to tell you that when stocks have been crashing like Paul Walker after beating expectations for no reason, what do you do as a CEO and CFO to attempt to avoid this? You set the bar super fucking LOW to make sure your investors are nothing but happy and stop reducing your companies value by 10% every quarter. It’s like none of you have ever read a book on financial relations or PR.. Oh wait... 

Buy the stock or by calls, whatever you want to do, Saleforce will absolutely make you money this month. Merry Christmas assholes.

EDIT: Well boys and girls if you got in early this morning; Christmas came fucking early.

EDIT 2: Position adjustment: Day traded 12/31 250C for roughly 50% gain. Due to larger sell off then anticipated adjusted the Strike to 12/31 240C. 

There also seems to be a misconception about what I expect to gain from these contracts, and I need to make sure that everyone understands I do not chase 4000% gains. I’m not betting on CRM going to 300 by the end of December. 

When it comes to making money with bullish OTM positions the question is simple: Will the stock price rise enough, and at a high enough ROC (Average ROC presented with IV) to overcome the loss of speculative value, or Theta from its current position? When I release free money alerts I’m telling you that within the expiration date this will occur. Whether you want to hold and hope that it continues is fully up to you. In other words I’m happy to tell you what to buy, but I won’t tell you when to take profit. 

In other words people, don’t get greedy and bag-hold your fucking calls over the next month if you have OTM’s. Take advantage of the oversell on the bounce back and get out. You don’t buy OTM hoping for real value by the time they expire you buy them to sell on the one big day it bounces back._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 12x in a month - NIO / JMIA / TSLA / PLTR _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone actually read other research by Hindenburg?

Been awhile since I made a post educating you retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is "this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called "implied volatility." They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called "IV crush."** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand "Reversion to the Mean."

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a "reversion to the mean" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the "Kelley criterion" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

A bunch of strange action during AH as people read a confusing headline and misinterpret it as an issue of new shares (it's warrant redemption from when it was a SPAC, expected and already factored in by analysts).

I have been trading since 89 and I have never seen a stock with more shares short than the float. there is 25.91 million shares short more than the float of the stock. I have witnessed EXPE, ROOM, HLF and Volkswagen shorts, but never seen anything like this. How do you even short anymore than the float ? do you just make up shares which is illegal under the guidelines and trading rules.  

Then how do you get 65.16 million shares outstanding and 67.45 million shares short. Even if the float wasn't enough they shorted 2.29 million shares over every share ever issued in this company. How is it even possible? The answer is it isn't and it's illegal

Both have taken significant after-hours drops.  Are these money-making dips to buy first thing in the morning before they strike back up? Or, are these dips a big red-flag for these two?

FCEL is down from a close of $9.08 to an after-hours price of of $7.45.

BOX closed at $18.70 and immediately dropped below $17.50, right before a seemingly positive Q3 earnings call. Reports say that investors we're disappointed, although the dip seems to have happened before the call had occurred.

There's a vote tomorrow that a lot of retail investors are panicking about because "AlL ChyNeSe StocKs aRe GeTTinG deListEd". Bro. Look at this shitty spreadsheet I made, the panic today was in the EV sector, not Chinese stonks. Look at fucking $BABA and $JD chilling, huge market cap companies not panicking on a vote tomorrow,  know why? Because there's no fucking chance in hell they get de-listed.

[EV panic](https://preview.redd.it/vzwx2s9s4o261.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=187746ce8dfabf71d44a2d380b635ff856d44026)

Even if this vote passes, the companies get THREE YEARS to comply with the US about their stock exchanges being audited by US companies. Before you say NIO is audited by an American company, no it's not, it's a Chinese branch of that company and the US wants their own hooligans in there, which by law in China is not allowed because Chyna #1

Here's why you shouldn't panic:

Look at fucking Baillie Gifford and Company who own 8.91% of NIO who KNEW about the bill proceeding to the house from passing the senate in MAY 2020. They increased their ownership by over  ELEVEN MILLION SHARES, don't know how much money that is my smooth brained companion? That's over a $495M bet on NIO going upsies.

They have connections in the financial media and various regulatory agencies.

But one interesting thing is just to highlight a section of this DD that actually fulfilled today as promised:

**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**

>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.

And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).

What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  


If we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. 

That is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!

Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

TL;DR = GME, Tendies, Moon.

"Many use Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime or Microsoft Office. The subscription model continues to expand, as the company's sales and margins increase significantly and are more predictable than with one-off payments. The business models of many companies will have to adapt, especially due to the corona crisis. The subscription model will therefore continue to spread beyond the tech companies.  This is exactly where Zuora comes in, a SaaS platform to maintain and manage subscription services. 

In my opinion, such a tool is particularly helpful for small and medium-sized companies in order to manage invoices, check payments and analyze sales. And by specializing in the subscription model, you can set yourself apart from the well-known ones like SAP and Salesforce. The founder and CEO of Zuora was previously Chief Strategy Officer at Salesforce, so he definitely knows his stuff. You also have well-known customers (e.g. Zoom, Dazn, Daimler, Siemens, Microsoft, Nvidia, GoPro etc.), in whose success you also participate, and you also work with consulting firms such as Accenture, Deloitte and PwC.  

The growth was a bit disappointing lately, so the price crashed a bit, but recently it has recovered somewhat and is in a clear uptrend. The price (currently $ 11.70) is still far from the all-time high of $ 37.80 shortly after the IPO 2018 and the KUV is 5 compared to other SaaS companies such as B. ServiceNow or Zendesk cheap, so I see upside potential. In September they shot up to $ 17.80 within days of the numbers, which should be the target again in the medium term. With the hype that such disruptive companies are experiencing this year, at least I wouldn't be surprised. What do you all mean?"

Watching the China Hustle on Netflix is not DD. The only hustle is the fact that folks are fudding you out of your BABA's NIO's and JD's etc.

Lets look at the vote planned for tomorrow:

"This bill requires certain issuers of securities to establish that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. " (not owned by CCP)

"Foreign issuers of securities that use such a firm to prepare an audit report must disclose for each non-inspection year the percentage of shares owned by governmental entities where the issuer is incorporated, whether these governmental entities have a controlling financial interest, information related to any board members who are officials of the Chinese Communist Party, and whether the articles of incorporation of the issuer contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party." (Again, a lot of focus on CCP)

In other words, proof that your books arent cooked and more importantly that you're not a CCP front operation. 

Thats a fair ask. The bill is mostly about the CCP fears and their geopolitcal expansion. This varies from data collection to militairy tech advancements. It would be silly to have your adversaries militech companies funded by US investors.

The bill is not about preventing cooked books, or protecting the average retail investor. This is a geopolitcal chess move aimed at key CCP companies.

If this was about financial transparency, what about the SEC? or all big banks for that matter. 

The ADR is not a Chinese invention. The US banks facilitated the onboarding of Chinese companies to the NYSE, and made a lot of money on the back of retail over the years.

The only reason why this bill is on the table is very simple, leverage or final "trump" card. This will drive further negotiations on sanctions and geopolitical topics.

One thing I have been wondering is this, if we do get the huge short squeeze and hypothetically let's say it hits $50. Who is going to buy all our shares when we want to exit? Are the shorts going to be the ones paying $50 a share to exit their positions? Wouldn't they realize this is exactly what we are hoping for and just hold their positions until it drops again? Retail definitely isn't going to buy our shares at that price. Who exactly will be paying us our profits?

Thanks for any answers and Goodluck everyone!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SUMO - Going Belly Up As you regret your post Turkey day belly gains, let me give you a bit of insight into SUMO. I've started a medium sized position and am expecting this to go belly up over the coming weeks. Hoping y'all can get in before the run-up is too late.

**My Positions**:

https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69345e8adbae2e1bc707664b1a453fb3a63641f

**Background**:

SUMO is a cloud based analytics platform that enables clients to summarize their data and provide extra security. Think of it as a mini-PLTR with a focus on cyber security and issue management. They IPO'ed on Sept 17.

As far as their product goes - it plays well with all major products including AWS, GCP, and Azure. That speaks to their client base, which ranges from Pokemon Go to Airbnb, but includes whales like $BUD and $DAL - any company who values data and cyber security is in play.

[Financials](https://investor.sumologic.com/static-files/ede9f243-bb20-40a3-b3e9-d60835488125) look good - they've grown 50% YOY for the past few years with extremely low large customer contributions (2100+ customers). Revenue is $155m, which is like .0001% of the cloud security/analytics market share ($50b TAM). All revenue is recurring, and all clients are locked into multi-year deals when they sign. Clients don't seem to churn, and are in fact increasing their revenue spend as the contract goes on.

They do have significant competition in companies like DDOG ($550m in Rev / $30b in market cap), SNOW ($400m in Rev / $90b market cap), and CRWD ($480m in Rev / $33b market cap) vs their $155m in Rev and $2.6b in market cap. Institutions are starting to grab shares - 60% institutional ownership and climbing fast. 

**Research**:

They break their business into 3 tiers: Small, mid, and enterprise market. They have 70+ openings (\~ 10% of headcount), with a focus on Enterprise and Sales positions, which would indicate they are expecting high growth and a focus on larger clients. 

They've projected slower growth rates into Q1 and Q2 of 2021 at about 25-30%, which caused their stock price to fall off when they IPO'ed (since recovered). However, they are also projecting much lower costs, which will lead to higher margins and profit.

Recent reviews on Glassdoor haven't been friendly, granted most tech companies let go lots of people with COVID and those employees need a forum to express frustration. Their new leadership seems focused on growth and the IPO, which may not be fun for most employees, but will be good for profit margins.

**Play/TLDR**:

Earnings is Dec 7. Buy shares and sell covered calls to grab high premiums for Dec earnings and roll it into longer dated OTM calls in Feb/March. Unless they beat guidance massively for Q1/Q2, the stock will sit tight, and then gain over the coming weeks as institutions continue buying._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PFE UK vs USA For those of you betting the $PFE vaccine approval.

Closing price was 246.34 which makes 0.0776 worth $19.11. So that makes Slack stock worth about $45.90/share. But that definitely isn't 27.7 billion. You can see what the price should be based on different market caps in the photo. So for that acquisition it should be around $48.50

What am I missing here?
