Get ready for the biggest paradigm shift in medical practice since the x-ray💀

The stethoscope is to the Doctor as the sword is to the warrior; and just as the sword was replaced with the firearm, so to does point of care ultrasound (POCUS)

With increasing ease of access to CT and x-ray imaging, the negative effects of radiation exposure have prompted a shift in medicine toward less harmful imaging.

In steps ultrasound. Ultrasound isn’t new of course, but traditionally it has been performed by specialty trained ultrasonographers. it uses sound waves rather than radiation, removing ionizing radiation from the picture. the limitation of the current US model, especially in resource limited or acute care settings, is the time from ordering the study to completion and interpretation by a radiologist (1hr or more) or communities without access to ANY imaging.

US teaching to doctors and advanced practice providers has EXPLODED in the last 3-4 years, with medical schools and residencies integrating US training and fellowships as standard.

In the near future, providers in acute care settings will be expected to utilize US as a diagnostic tool, and it is a very exciting time for many of us.

BUTTERFLY NETWORK has changed the game forever. they offer an US probe that was the first of its kind. it is small, and attached to your phone or tablet and provides very high quality US imaging on demand.

This is HUGE. 

The limitation was cost ($2000). but the cost limitation is over

Yesterday, BUTTERFLY announced their newest generation of POCUS, the IQ+ at the same price as their first generation model.

The first generation model may now be found on ebay by sellers for around ($1000). 

prices are going down and providers now have visual window access orders of magnitude better than the traditional stethoscope.

BUTTERFLY is not yet publicly traded, but it’s main investors are the BILL and Melinda Gates Foundation.

other companies have followed suit that ARE public:

FUJI FILM
GE
SAMSUNG
HITACHI
TOSHIBA

and others have developed their own versions, but none have offered the diagnostic quality at the price of BUTTERFLY.

Forget big pharma. This is the future. be on the lookout..

Wish has rapidly growing revenues, and the vast majority of their operating expenses are marketing related. In 2019, if they had cut their marketing budget by 8.8% then they would have broken even. This is a good sign imo, it means they are reinvesting all the profits (and then some, including the cash they will get from this IPO) into growing the company, but they could choose to be profitable at any time, which is a sign of a well run business.

Their cost of revenue increased this year, and currently its growth is outpacing their revenue growth (cost of revenue in 2020 so far made up a greater portion than cost of revenue by this time in 2019, for example) but I assume a lot of that is due to the pandemic, and their cost of revenue as a percentage of their revenue was flat from 2018-2019, so this year is probably an irregularity. It's likely that their cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will drop next year.

~~This isn't quite Shopify, which has 50 employees and billion dollar yearly revenues.~~ But it is still an e-commerce company that mostly hosts other people's products, so its operating expenses don't scale with its revenues. This is a very good thing. It means insane potential profitability as their revenue grows.

Their financial filing with the SEC is here, it has all the numbers I mentioned (or you can calculate them from the given numbers): [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm#rom82777\_2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm#rom82777_2)

Ok.  Last quarter, they posted a huge earnings beat, and the stock value jumped.  I dont know how the stock will react this time, but I'm telling you the earnings beat will be similar this time around.  They report Tuesday before market open.  Consensus expectations are lower than they were for Q2.  

Here's what Dick's Sporting Goods has been up to:

* Their workers have been getting bonus pay since March and no stores have cut hours.
* Management announced in September they'd need to hire additional staffing for the holiday season
* They cannot keep large items in stock.  They have been selling out of everything.  Primarily including: weight systems, golfing gear, driveway basketball systems, camping and fishing gear, backyard recreational shit like trampolines, etc.

And here's the anecdotal version.  I have a friend who is a freight manager there and I've been asking him to put certain things on reserve for me.  He laughed and said it's impossible.  I wanted weights, and he said he can't put them on the floor and expect them to last through his shift.  I asked if it was still as busy as it was back in April and May and he said if anything it's busier.  

"Do you think thats just your store?"

"Everywhere.  Nobody in our region has extra inventory."

Here's a couple versions of earnings history and expectations http://imgur.com/a/WmYq7mn

\- FMR LLC - newly added about 800K shares. They are a little known money manager called Fidelity. As one of the biggest mutual fund/money managers in existence, this is huge. 

These four groups provide tremendous validation to IPOB/Opendoor - nameplate anchors in the equity (who collectively now own close to 25% of the float) who will help attract a ton of followership as this gets to merger. 

You can validate the data on your own looking at the institutional holdings tracked by Nasdaq or CapIQ.

Here's why you should buy the shit out of this: 

1. Bill Gates, the architect of Covid-19, is an early investor. He doesn't fuck around with garbage companies and has more influence than most foreign heads of state
2. VRM isn't selling Lambos and Beemers, it is going after the mass market of people who just need an affordable car for 5-20k. "Sell to the rich and you'll be poor, sell to the poor and you'll be rich"
3. Covid isn't going anywhere. Lockdowns would affect manufacturing at the major automakers which will limit the supply of new cars and push up sales of USED CARS to record levels.
4. Check out [this comparison](https://prnt.sc/vniexh) between Carvana, CarMax, and Vroom. Major divergence and I expect to see some mean reversion since they all do basically the same thing, except VRM is targeting a poorer/larger market where there's better margins.
5. Stimmy time ain't happening until 2021 (don't listen to that bitch, Nancy) - which means consumers have to be smart with large capital expenditures, and VRM provides both value and convenience.

First, I’d like to preface with my understanding that General Motors has a terrible track record when it comes to EVs. In fact, their EV1 (the first mass produced electric vehicle) took a colossal shit in the 90s- leading to the recall and destruction of nearly all leased cars. Even looking at present day, current offerings are also shit; the volt is disturbingly ugly and costs too much, and the bolt looks like a premature avocado. That said, I see a bright future for $GM in the coming months.

**$GM vs $TSLA for the consumer EV**

Tesla (TSLA) obviously has the predominant market share of US EV market, but GM is well equipped to take over a significant portion of the Chinese market. Elon constantly talks of a $25k Tesla for the “poors”, but the three-year timeline for this is uncertain. Hongguang Mini, made by a GM joint venture, costs just $4,300 and is currently the bestselling EV in China (surpassing the M3). While something this small most likely wouldn’t succeed in US or Canadian markets, there is a large opportunity within Asian and European markets. GM (thus far) has predominant market share in the entry level EVs.

&#x200B;

[$4,300!](https://preview.redd.it/6kdoyll86n061.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5533bc905b40d7f4bc67ddec715bb8cd2d2fe634)

**$GM ups spending on EVs and autonomous cars by 35% to $27 billion**

&#x200B;

* GM will spend $27 billion on all-electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, an increase of $7 billion, from initial plans announced in March.
* The increase in investment will support GM’s plans to release 30 new EVs globally by 2025, including more than 20 for North America.
* GM said it has moved up the release of 12 EVs, including pickups for its Chevrolet and GMC brands.

Comparing Tesla and General Motor’s R&D costs, GM spent about $7.8 billion on research and development in 2018, an amount that was again 5X more than Tesla’s R&D spending of $1.5 billion during the same year. That said, Tesla is obviously the leader in this EV market. So how will this 35% increase put GM ahead?

https://preview.redd.it/kwfxcdw36n061.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fb1dbcdd91bb0740f04a0afc8db242250672c16

As seen from the chart, from 2013 to 2015, Tesla’s R&D spending ratio rose quickly from 11% to 18% revenue whereas GM’s R&D spending ratio has more or less stayed in the same range at 5% during the same period. However, the gap of R&D ratio between Tesla and GM were closing in in 2019 at 5% when Tesla’s figure was seen de-accelerating since 2016 and reached the lowest at 5% revenue in 2019.

While Tesla’s R&D budget growth rate turned negative in 2019, the average figure was still around 40% for the past 7 years which is much better than GM’s average R&D expenses growth rate of -1% over the same period.

In other words, GM’s R&D expenses have roughly stayed in the same level in average from 2013 to 2019. This increase in spending will be help GM reach its new goal of launching 30 new EVs 2025. This is a significant increase from the previously stated 22 vehicles.

This increased spending will also go towards the second generation of its uItium battery when it is released in 2025. This battery will be 60% cheaper than the Chevrolet Bolt battery, while doubling the expected energy density. Furthermore, GM has partnered with LG to manufacture the ultium battery at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which opens in the first quarter of 2021 and will have a capacity for 30 GWh/yr. On the contrary, battery production at Gigafactory 1 reached an annualized rate of roughly 20 GWh in 2018.

**Technicals**

*I’ll be honest, I know nothing about fundamentals, P/E ratios, or even what the greeks mean. I haven’t taken a single economics finance course in college- I study rhetoric. However, I do my research and take buying opportunities when I see them. I’ll refer to Deutsche Bank and their 12% increased price target on Friday.*

"We are very encouraged by GM's updated product and investment strategy and targeted cost/margin trajectory, which could ultimately give it a strong market position and solid profitability in EVs”.

https://preview.redd.it/tmv0umad6n061.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=057ebfb940124c31343ab6dc557af6870f3024af

From a price perspective, GM hasn’t moved above its October 2017 all-time high and has only just moved beyond its earlier peak in December 2013. In respect to EV stocks, GM’s trading volume is still relatively low @ 16M Friday. Comparing $NIO @ 209M, $TSLA @ 32M, and shit $NKLA @ 18M - retails investors have yet to consider $GM in this EV race. Once volume and media news increases, I can see volume and price increasing easily.

**Design**

From the examples seen thus far, General Motors is not fucking around when it comes to design. Take the recent C8 for example: The C8 is using the same type of materials as the C7 (aluminum frame, plastic and carbon body), manufacturing techniques, and the same types of engine components that they already have. Yes, a mid-engine car is theoretically better, but design innovations have been at the center of discussion within the industry.

The Hummer Ev and Cadillac Lyric look fantastic, and will provide luxury consumers the ability to choose something other than a Tesla, Audi e-tron, or EQC in the coming years. GM has also teased the new Chevy EV truck, exemplifying this continued design innovation.

How are my beaten-down RKT retards feeling after the ass pounding this past week? I am fairing fine because mentally I knew this was going to happen, which is why I've carried a giant bottle of lube around in preparation for this recent "packing of thy fudge" if you will.

But if you disappointed RKT retards want to feel better about your torn-apart assholes, then I encourage you to click the link below:

[https://www.nexsystech.com/](https://www.nexsystech.com/)

Nexsys is in the Rocket FOC (family of companies); they offer two revolutionary products:

Clear Sign - this is a digital platform that is on par with Docusign's product - you know Docusign, the over $40B dollar company whose sole purpose is to digitally sign documents THE SAME way that the Clear Sign platform allows lenders to engage in Eclosings. Clear Sign is tailored for the mortgage industry - it’s not a one-size-fits-all digital signing package from a company who doesn’t know mortgage closings from mini marts. Eclosings, outside of RKT are very rare but will soon be the industry standard providing immense growth for this product which is already certified for legal use in 25 states (will soon be all 50 states).

The next product is:

Nexsys clear HOI- This technology platform makes it easier to connect insurers and mortgage lenders (yes they are selling this to their competitors). It is a one-stop homeowners insurance verification site that streamlines and automates the process.

Nexsys is also going to launch another product for lenders (again, their competitors) which will pull insurance information from a direct API into your LOS or use Nexsys' online portal. It’s connected to any insurer in the network, and real-time updates can be made in seconds rather than days. The product will allow for users to initiate policy updates such as mortgagee changes and effective date changes with their APIs or portal.

Nexsys is offering another product, aimed at insurers, which will enable insurers to do the following:

* Free up agents’ time, call center inquiries and B2B, portal maintenance by automating third-party requests; Kick the processes and expenses that don’t generate business to the curb.
* Communicate to your lenders with consistency. Insurers message and your policy information are sent using the same format every time, eliminating potential data input errors and other delays.

Why is this important you ask? Well if you are retarded enough to buy RKT at $30, then you are probably retarded enough to not understand why this is eye opening.

RKT is selling their products TO THEIR COMPETITORS - which tells you where RKT's true focus lies: technology, NOT mortgages and if you don't think they will continue to invent and sell more industry-disrupting products like this, then you are highly mistaken.... and retarded. Also there is a big focus on helping insurers with these products - what company does BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY own in insurance?  GEICO - this is a platform not only for mortgages but will also be used for auto. Hmm I wonder who ROCKETS big partnership will be with, which they are waiting until early 2021 to unveil... I also wonder the secret company Warren Buffett is investing in and chose not to disclose in the filing of last quarter's 13F.....

Jay Farner said it himself in an interview with CitiBank: we are a technology and marketing company that happens to also sell mortgages (I will do another write up on their digital marketing tech which they also sell B2B).

The fact that RKT is willing to sell their tech to competitors is eye opening - and if you notice none of the Wall Street analysts talk about this. They think RKT is just a mortgage company.

There is an information edge here that the market does not realize. For example, those of you who invested in RKT, did you know they were selling disrupting tech to their competitors? Probably not... and neither does the majority of the market.

Their tech provides simple, fast and trusted digital solutions for COMPLEX personal transactions. Millennials, who will soon make up the majority of the market, do not like anything complex. And this is why they constantly innovate, to satisfy the needs of their customers (dumb ass millenials). They've been leveraging decades of technology investment and innovation to drive industry disruption and deliver an unmatched customer experience in the largest consumer asset class in the us, supported by 3 percent annual home price appreciation \*knocks on wood\*

Also if you haven't listened to Farner's confrence with Citi, check it out, it is worth a listen. Enjoy your weekend fellow bag holders - and know your bag will only get lighter. Eh who knows maybe we are all fucked and should have just invested in EV instead.

Be in before your dumb biased friends

Warren Buffet owns it. He bought more during the 2020 crash. Saudi Arabia’s fund even bought Suncor, not Canadian oil stocks, Suncor specifically (google that suckers!). Suncor has massive potential.

Most don’t realize. But oil’s supply-side has taken a worse hit than demand. We always hear in the news “oil demand dropped! Oil demand this and that!” In reality, these oil producers stopped producing and now there’s a supply shortage.

Suncor is best positioned. They are the most efficient oil company in terms of process, and cost. In Canada, they are easily the most efficiently run company.

They have hidden value on their assets. Look at their Refining and Marketing. R&M alone puts their valuation higher than where the stock’s trading at.

*Skip this paragraph if you want, not necessary But if you wanna blow people’s minds, understand what I’m about to say.* The reason Suncor’s R&M business segment has hidden value is because it’s made up of refineries purchased a very long time ago. Under IFRS (and GAAP too) companies are not allowed to value a property higher than what they bought it for. Doesn’t matter if it’s worth 2x or 100x from where the company bought it. Suncor’s refineries are old. They are included in their ‘book value’ at net $9 billion (look up their statements, go to business segments and look for Refining and Marketing). So $9Bn on the books. They have 4 refineries. A SIGNLE REFINERY costs at minimum $10 BILLION to build in Canada. Suncor has 4 included in their R&M assets. So already, that $9Bn on their books is actually like $40bn. (That doesn’t include all the gas stations they own which is also included in that $9Bn, crazy I know.) But wait it gets better. In Canada, a refinery is worth wayyy more than just the metal it’s built from. Canada is highly regulated and almost impossible to build a new refinery. That means getting your hands on one in Canada is extremely important. It opens you up to a highly exclusive market. So remember that $40Bn we came up with? Imagine if Suncor wanted to sell those. Do you think they’d go for $40Bn in a market that’s next to impossible to penetrate? No. What would happen is every oil company in the world would say “wait Suncor is offering their Canada refineries, wtf! ?” Then they’d bid on them. And they wouldn’t pay $10Bn for 1. They’d bid those things to the moon. Picture what Exxon could accomplish with those refineries. It wouldn’t just be worth the building to Exxon, it would be worth adding to Exxon’s huge integrated network. And now in Canada? Wow. It seems like these refineries would go for way more. In fact each one is worth closer $30Bn. But guess what, Suncor isn’t gonna sell them because they know how much these refineries make.

How can you value these for sure and brag to your buddies? Well these refineries actually make around $3Bn in profits every year - check their statements and look at their average R&M earnings. If the average company is looking for a return of 5% on a new asset. These R&M assets are actually $60Bn ($3Bn / 5%). But that’s the average asset with an average company. What about an exclusive, almost impossible to penetrate market such as Canada? What if Exxon was looking to buy Suncor’s R&M assets? Well in this exclusive market, these discount rates aren’t 5%. They’re more like 2.5%, 1% or even <0.5%. The reason is because the value an acquirer adds to their business is worth far more than $3Bn that is currently produced every year.


Why are they so damn cheap? The problem is there was a one-two punch earlier this year. The OPEC supply war combined with a sharp drop in demand from government lockdowns. That combined with an already overall negative social sentiment toward oil meant quick sell offs. Funds were forced to sell for many reasons. Funds getting margin calls. On the debt side there are momentum funds having problems with oil & gas computer modelling. On the equity side, funds of every type are getting redemptions. A huge amount of what's going on is forced selling.

All of that meant a cheap price. Suncor is best positioned for a run up. Just ask Buffet or the f’ing Crown Price of Saudi Arabia!! Yes, please google that. They literally bought Suncor shares specifically.

The catalysts are of course vaccine talks. The recovery of demand. Supply shortage. But value alone is the biggest catalyst.

[Even this former Goldman Sachs PM thinks GME can be supercharged](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1329804056831922177?s=20) 

TDLR: Ryan Cohen thinks the Gamestop Management are dumb idiots but believes that GME 🚀🚀🚀💸💸💸. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, starting with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a  high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.

To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent.

Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction. He alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset.

Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. 

First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. 

Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.

**Stock Market Value**: $828 million ($12.71 per share)

## Activist: Ryan Cohen

**Percentage Ownership:** 9.98%

**Average Cost:** $5.98

**Activist Commentary:** Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company [Chewy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CHWY), which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.

## What’s Happening:

On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.

## Behind the Scenes:

Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.

Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.

However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.

To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as [Advance Auto Parts](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAP), [Best Buy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY) and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.

The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023. 

Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.

If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.

It will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century. In the words of former U.S. Army General Eric Shinseki: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on $TLS Telos (Palantir son) What do ya’ll think of Telos?

I thought there was a drop in users. 

Juat self some retard doubt that I want to get your tist gist on.

FDA to consider Pfizer vaccine for EAU on dec 10. Good time to buy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Curious Case for Clean Energy So we've all seen what weaponized autism can do to stocks like NIO and Tesla and I'm here to say things are just getting started. The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). 

So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. 

So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.

Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

TLDR: buy clean energy etf calls

However shit companies like BLNK are trading at 150x sales now lmao. 

I made a lot on SBE and sold at $25 bc this shit is unsustainable. The FOMO is real and I can’t wait for the Christmas bagholder special: EV edition next month.

Take profits, don’t be retarded_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trying to find the next meme. Liquified Nat Gas and engines for alt energy vehicles Long discussion ahead. Skip to bottom for positions. Buy WPRT Calls.

TL;DR is that I think this has potential to become a meme soon.

By EOD I bailed on everything I had in EVs/FCEL/PLUG, aside from my Nio shares. Maybe I dipped out too early, but I think the EVs and likes of PLUG/FCEL are gonna be difficult to navigate now that the initial hysteria could be dying off. both FCEL and PLUG closed below the highs they hit on Thursday, but who knows, market gonna market. Anyway.

I don't think we're done with alternative energy and tech. What I like now are alternative fuel sources for cars - namely liquified, renewable, and compressed natural gas. Some of this shit is even made from waste products and I'm told it's a cleaner alternative to regular old fuel. The best part is, there are some actual sales and usage of this already. I like the market to transition to alt energy that is a little more profitable in the short-term, as they've been dumping a ton of money into companies that have little or zero revenue. We either go full retard into EVs and hydrogen or we see a short pull back.

Right now the US only has like 200k of these vehicles max, mainly trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles. Plenty of room for growth. China has 5 million, but I don't know of the companies who did it there. The most glaring problem is that this technology has already been tried and failed, but this redemption story is playing out now in the hydrogen sector with PLUG/FCEL. The U.S. made a huge push for this back in 2008 and the two stocks I'll be talking about hit their ATH in 2012 (WPRT $45 and CLNE $28). Currently they're sitting at $3.50ish a share.

However, I believe we see a renewed interest now with Biden in office and this hype for greener energy solutions. This shit is something we have available now and can start using today until things like hydrogen and EVs become the norm. It's ideal for the transition and we do need realistic and practical solutions for right now, until newer tech gets where it needs to be.

WPRT is my favorite of the two. They make the engines and components for vehicles using natural gas and hydrogen. They're under Cummins (CMI), which has proven to be an outstanding company. WPRT has doubled in the last 2 weeks, up 12% Friday on good, but not insane volume.

CLNE is a pure play on liquified/compressed/renewable natural gas and fueling stations. The stock is up 40% in the last 2 weeks. Up almost 9% Friday on good volume. I think WPRT is the true play, as their financials look better and have ties to Cummins. Not to mention they are involved with both nat gas and hydrogen.

Both stocks are still under the radar and have had mooning days, but also flat days and red days, so they're far from meme status. They closed near their daily highs, while many stocks faded. Someone is buying this shit. I see huge potential here, but it could easily fizzle out without some kind of news in the form of increased government backing or new contracts from a huge companies.

**Positions: WPRT $3 calls 12/18, WPRT $4 calls 01/15 (66%)**

**CLNE $3 calls 12/18, CLNE $4 calls 01/15   (33%)**

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
> Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
> In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
> “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
> “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
> Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
> The S&P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
> JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
> “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
> But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
> The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
> The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
> Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
> Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
> “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
> She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

> # The Thanksgiving Trade

> Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&P 500 decline was in 1964.

> Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

> Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

> # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

> First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

> How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

> The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

> Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

> The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

> Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

> It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

> The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

> # A Month for the Ages

> Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

> In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

> In the large-cap S&P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

> While just about every stock in the S&P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

> # Long Term Averages Taken Out

> With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

> As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

> In the table below, we show a list of the S&P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

> # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

> Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

> Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Retard vs Autist Ffs, I can’t believe I’m triggered enough while taking a shit that I needed to stop mid-wipe to write this shit.

I know most of you fucks work at Wendy’s and eat crayons on the daily but for fucks sake, can you fuckers learn the difference between retard and autists??

RETARD - This is 99% of this subreddit. You dumb fucks will throw your life savings into a weekly or 0dte yolo because some dumb fucks DD had all rockets.

Example of a retard is that fucker who dumped his life savings of $250k into GME weeklies, this is a prime example of a Retard.

AUTIST - think about the movie “rain man”. This guy is a fucking autist. He jerks off to his DD and charts, can’t speak in complete sentences but will draw support lines up the ass on a chart. 

This is a fucking autist, think the purple mattress guy, this is a prime example of an Autist.

God damnit, I need to rub one out now because I’m so god damn triggered.

TLDR - Retard go stonk stonk stonk, autist go x, y, z calculus_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on BABA Ok so who the fuck looks and Jack Ma and doesnt feel instant trust and comfortability in placing a fucking YOLO on that mans company?

[QuantumScape (QS): Upside of 100% or More? (Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jts3au/quantumscape_qs_upside_of_100_or_more_bill/)

The ticker QS will come live in just a week's time.  In the meantime, the current ticker is KCAC.

Anyways, on to to relevant quotes from Farooque's article:

> Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY)-backed QuantumScape, a manufacturer of large-capacity solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Volkswagen will use the company exclusively for its EV needs. Being the European EV market leader, the fastest-growing EV market on the planet should be reason enough for you to be bullish.

> However, it would help if you were patient with this stock. All of the parties involved said they have enough funds to back its ambitions. But the issue is cost-effectiveness and managing demand. Since we are dealing with experimental technology, those issues can be resolved in due time. You need to hang tight and believe in the concept.

*Disclosure: Long on KCAC warrants.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Welcome PLTR to the meme team _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can I get some TA on this chart please? Looking to see when to expect a rebound. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell calls using leaps as collateral If you already know this, then fuck off. This post is for the retards here who don’t.

You can sell calls using your leaps as collateral, just open up your $1000 RH account and click “sell” instead of “buy” in the options menu.

So when PLTR is fucking mooning and IV is high, sell a slightly OTM call and then on days like yesterday rebuy the calls (or let them expire OTM) and use the premium to buy shares.

Here is a YouTube video explaining it:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1PiUOgiYk

You can also use this strategy to get around PDT restrictions.

If you buy a SPY call at it’s dip and SPY revs up but you can’t DT it because your dumbass used your last DT to finally sell a call when it was -25% instead of +10%, then sell a call THE STRIKE ABOVE the one you have bought - you’ll collect that premium instantly and you can just let the options expire who gives a fuck you already made gains.

This also works for puts, but when selling a put using a put as collateral you sell THE STRIKE BELOW the one you are using as collateral.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Why Moderna?

This vaccine will be Moderna’s first product on the market. It’s a huge deal for them. Also of course it does not need to be stored at fucking cryogenic temperatures. Additionally, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccine uses mRNA technology. Success will provide proof that this type of technology works. Moderna’s research and development in general (not just on the covid vaccine) is fixated on this type of technology (hence the ticker $MRNA) and so its success will be huge for them as a company. Moderna will absolutely be applying for EUA soon, and when they do the stock will spike, as it will when it receives approval.

Questions

“Is it priced in?”

No. Just look at what happened to BioNTech stock today.

**The Big Short**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.
* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.
* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.
* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24
* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  "4IR", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

So I've been jizzing my pants at my PLTR gains so far. In in those post-nut moments of clarity, I decided to read some J.R.R. Tolkien. 

Do you fucking nerds know what Palantir even is? Yeah, yeah, you've seen the memes about Saruman viewing tendies in some kind of black sphere. But do you know the story of the Palantirs? Yes, plural, you illiterate autist. There's 7 of these motherfuckers. Alright? SEVEN!. Now if you're a a homosexual ursine kind of fellow, you'll be like, "Ah HA! Divide stock price by 7! PUTS!" But if you're a chad bovine, you'll be like "Ah HA! Multiply stock by 7! CALLS!". But you're both retards.

Listen, go pop you some popcorn and, and get your fucking DVDs out, if you autists aren't too young to have those, because it's movie night bitches. I know y'all are too damn lazy to read the book, so pop the goddamn movie in. Y'all were taught by dick whistling substitute teachers, weren't y'all? 

For those of you too damn lazy to get stoned and watch some good ass movies, let me lay it out for you. There are 7 goddamn Palantirs. They are known as "The Seeing Stones". Right? You following? I see you thinking "damn, that's a good ass name for this company." After all, what is AI besides goddamn electricity pulsing through fucking rock and other minerals. But stop right there, wipe that grin off your face. You know what the Palantirs are known for? Deception. That's right motherfuckers, this homoerotic trans-species adventure story would've ended with one goddamn book if people didn't believe in the Palantir. 

Alright, so for those of you watching the movie, fast forward through the gay shit and peep my boy Sauron. He's looking through one of the Palantir, and you know what this fucking retard sees? He sees Pippin! Fuckin' gangly ass, always eating, but never chubby Pippin! So Sauron's like, "we're gonna get this bitch." Surprise cock bag! He ain't got the ring.   


Alright, pop the next movie in and fast forward. You know who looks at the Palantir next? Fucking Boromir's dad. You know what this chode yodeling ballsack tickler sees? He sees an impossible defeat, he makes crucial decisions on the fake news he sees. Keep fast forwarding. You see what actually happens? Aragon whips his big dick energy all around with a fucking ghost army, and Boromir's punk ass bitch of a dad kills himself by throwing himself off a ledge because he's like "fuuuuuuuuuuuck, my teeeeeeeeendieeeeeeeeees, I bought puuuuuuuuuuuuuts." \*Splatter and pants shitting noise\*      


Alright, put the last movie in, this one ended like 27 times and you never know which one actually is the end. Trust, if you think watching a movie with 27 endings is bad, try fucking reading it. But before the ending(s) arrive, guess what fart-bubble eaters? The fucking Palantir show up again! This time though, it ain't entirely deceptive. My homie Sauron peeps into it again, and guess what this ghost-fucking flame-dick sees? He sees Aragon with his big dick wearing that ring like he's trying to maintain an erection on his way to Mordor. For those of you watching the movie, you know that isn't true, you know Frodo is rocking the cockring on his mircopeen on his way to Mordor. Either way though, it's on it's way to Mordor. Which, if you're both illiterate and don't enjoy good ass movies, that's bad for my Dark Lord Sauron.  Speaking of, what does this phallic fondler do? He goes on the offensive, he leaves Mordor to go on the offensive, trying to lure Aragon away. That's like buying PLTR puts. Fuck! But y'all seen the movie, y'all know what happens. It was a bad move.  

So what's the moral of the story here?  Once, the Palantir misled with optimism, twice it mislead with pessimism. That's 2:1. Fuck gay bears. Buy PLTR._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options strategy: I have 3 contracts with same expiry and $5 difference for the strike for each contract.

I am the definition of mediocrity although it took me an extra year to graduate high school.

As I aged like cheese the duller and more boring I became. When I was 28 I decided to get a job that was paying a little bit better than working at a Wendy's'. Since I had this extra cash laying around I thought I'd start "investing", but not in boring ass stocks, I'm going to make big money...weed stocks. 

Canada had legalized weed for while and I thought they were going to be the new disruption to recreational drug use. I started throwing all my money in weed stocks, TRST, TBP, MMEN, you name it. Every paycheck went into buying more weed stocks (I don't touch the stuff but I could see my sister was addicted). I became less obsessed with going outside and showering and more time "investing". Over time I had probably 20k sunk into it lowering my average every paycheck as the stock spiraled downward. Desperate for hope I turned to /r/weedstocks so myself and the hive mind brethren could post shit about how this is going to happen one day and we would be rich.

Then news hit about TSLA going bankrupt. Everyone on TV is important, and were talking about this so I checked TSLA out. I did my DD by looking at /r/teslainvestorclub and the hive mind brethren would post shit about how this is going to happen one day and we would be rich. So what did I do? I sold most of my weed positions except the ones that went so low that I thought it would be better to bag hold and put the rest in TSLA. Oh man I was a risky boy betting stocks on this ev company. 

Turns out they fixed their problem with bankruptcy and the stock started to go up, but I wasn't making money fast enough. I don't remember if was the important people on TV or some fake news but something led me to you beautiful retards.

Options, why have I never heard of this before, I'm an "investor", I should know this. You guys managed to explain it in a way that was relating, entertaining, and not wanting to make me shoot my brains out. From there I following the retarding stone of learning.

I have more recent leaps added but these are my bread and butter. From these positions I now have more money than I ever dreamed of. Since I thought I was a god why not try day trading as well. After losing like 20k I understand why most people fail, fuck that shit. 

None of this shit is advice, I continue holding long until my parents kick me out. I am still shit at doing this and will always have the view that this is glorified gambling. I risk it all cause I'm young, beautiful and have no baggage holding me down (Also my lifestyle hasn't changed at all, so if I lose it I am still in the same position). I just want to give the perception all this is possible even from a retard like me who will probably lose it all (started doing covered calls).

[Here is proof](https://imgur.com/a/cfwl5DO)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are you autists so stuck at minor price differences, especially with PLTR Literally people crying about buying at 19 while it is at 18.14 currently.

Are you retarded? If everyone agrees this is a long term play, buying at 12,15 or even 20 doesn't matter. Either this is going to be something or not and the few dollars more or less won't matter shit.

I see people making prediciton of it reaching easily 300 but in the next sentence writing buying anything under 20 is good... Bitch if you are convinced it reaching over 100 than even buying at 50 is great.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Future SPAC Trendy: GIK - LOI Expected to Drop This Week or Next 👀 👀 Sup my people,

Even though some of these EV companies are a total joke, I think we found a winner here. GIK and Lightning eMotors are in “advanced talks” regarding a funding deal. See the excerpt below for funding info and what Lightning does:

“Lightning eMotors has raised about $28 million and was valued at about $47 million after a March funding led by BP Ventures, according to PitchBook Data. It said at that time it would use the funding to ramp up production to fulfill new orders for electric powertrains for Ford Transits, Ford E-450s, Ford F-59 step vans, Chevrolet Low Cab Forward 6500XD trucks and Lightning Electric city buses.

The company in October said it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, increased production and doubled its workforce.”

The wave on this guy hasn’t come close to starting with volume only picking up yesterday. Traded sideways all day until after hours where it went up ~3%. As stated LOI is expected to drop within the next two weeks. Could be the next CIIG. 

Do your own research, but let me know your thoughts.

I don’t know I’m retarded. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ZM Speculation Double D's Hey fellas. Here's my speculative ZM DD. Short and small. Like your gains if you havn't been playing TSLA, NIO, PLTR, CRSR.

- Lockdowns coming in fast (Illinois, Ontario eh)
- Cases rising more each day (USA numba one!!1)
- Thanksgiving coming on Thursday (people saying use Zoom versus visiting)
- Zoom is offering unlimited time on Thanksgiving. Solid PR by them. Gets people talking 
- Zoom earnings report November 30th after hours. Stock went up fast last ER run up then jumped 45%+/- next day. Remember that? Also, remember negative oil?
- Cases rising and lockdowns = boomers, WSB, and millennial plebs rotating their Robinhood accounts back into tech and home stocks.

This is my DD to buy ZM calls. 

Buy 12/4 600c for maximum leverage and IV crush. Buy weeklies (not FDs) or monthlies for lower risk but lower gain. Review your Greeks before you buy.
Positions: 12/18 500c.

Numbers are too high for COVID cases, but how long it remains in shutdown will be based on # of new cases and how many people are getting tested. I figure we’re gonna get shut down and stay shut down until after New Years. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years... I remember doing thanksgiving dinner hopping back in the day. Anyways, people are gonna get together and the shutdown will prob linger.

Listen you sad AYRO buyers who got in at the top, there is still hope for you to recover BY NEXT WEEK.

Karma Automotives has been in the electric car making business for years now, most notably their work for FSR (Fisker) in 2012 when making the Fisker Karma.

And before you say “BUT THEY WENT BANKRUPT” well actually- the battery suppliers for the Fisker Karma went bankrupt so they were unable to continue to produce the cars. (Which they are STILL PRODUCING BECAUSE OF THEIR NEW INNOVATIONS)

What does this mean for AYRO? Well they are set to bring in more than $300 million dollars for this 20,000 car collaboration, making all sorts of equipment vehicles for companies based in the U.S. since they manufacture out of CALIFORNIA!!! YES NOT ANOTHER CHINESE PUMP AND DUMP

AYRO right now is selling for $8 a share, and nearly hit $10 just this morning but was blind sighted by another idiotic Andrew Left article, just hop the fuck on before it’s too late, out of all the EV’s AYRO has the most room for growth because it hasn’t hit a fucking 1000% jump yet like every  others EV._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB This Week This sub summarized for the week:

Calls. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME So yea, GME didn’t hit 14, and I should be banned right now but mods are probably still working at Wendies, so maybe they’ll do it after their shift is done. (Tagged one earlier). But today was overall very bullish for GME. We sustained the breakout and closed above 12.70. today was a bit weird Becuase of OPEX and MM’s were obviously trying to destroy options by pinning the price at 12.70. Also, we’ve stopped following IWM, before these last few days, movement was heavily influenced by the Russel 2000 movement, which was annoying as fuck. But we seem to be out of that, and out of the range that we’ve been in for about 3 weeks now.  

Also, idk how much more I have to say this but, the squeeze isn’t something that starts suddenly. I see people always ask “is it happening?!? GME squeeze starting?!?” After a morning spike. No, the squeeze isn’t starting yet, it needs a catalyst, which will likely be Cohen buying out GME.

Moving on...

Look at this:

https://imgur.com/a/kWEpwpX

What you are looking at is:

- A strong dip
- A very strong bull rally
- A long period of consolidation

It is the third point which would excite any 'price action traders', should they hang around here

What you are looking at is an extraction of liquidity from the markets. An event that happens on any trending market. The price narrows into a contracting channel as all parties wishing to partake gradually find common ground

The pattern is fractal. If you look at charts where an asset is trending, you will see this pattern time and time again. Months, weeks, hours, minutes - it does not matter

The point to consider is, where is the liquidity in this market?

Because it is only the presence, (or absence!), of liquidity that drives markets. Take a moment to absorb that, because it is entirely relevant to what I am about to say next

The rally between March and August *was not* caused by strong buying liquidity entering the market. It was caused by a contraction of supply. Think about what a price change really means for a moment... absolute number of buyers/sellers doesn't matter. You can have a situation where you have the same numbers of buyers, but simply by contracting your selling, you can pump the market price

IF, you are big. Like JPM big, or hedge fund big. And most stocks are owned by pension funds, who would presumably be agreeable to pumping prices because they are never going to sell anyway. Second biggest owner is the investment banks and hedge funds. Between those three, they control the vast majority of buying/selling power in the market. Which gives them the power to control the price simply by *restricting selling*

Back to the graph. This period of liquidity is nearing it's end. Therefore the market must find it's next bounds of liquidity 

It could break high, it could break low, I don't know. But it signifies a powerful and decisive market move (btw the lines converge in early Jan, so could happen anytime until then. Action within the pennants is deemed chaotic)

I have marked two consolidation periods. The first on the 4H, the second a trend line. I do both because there is a beautiful confluence and I just cannot resist it, but ignore the smaller pennant and focus on the larger

If we break the lower limit of the first line, nothing doing

If we decisively break the lower limit of the second one too, there is a problem

If we break the upper lines decisively... long_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Take Me to $1M I'm pretty new to this page, but I check it more often than Instagram at this point. Thank you for helping me get to a new peak--these gains are from a combination of organic W2 savings and a moon-bound market, but I've gotten a nice push recently from some BABA/PLTR/XPEV/SQ plays that I wouldn't have made without this group.

Hoping to reach the dos commas club by Q2 2021. There are some funny ass people on this page, and some that actually seem to know what they are talking about. Thank you all for your service.

AMEN!!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ELI5 - How do I avoid paying Overnight Funding on CFD apps when I am not using leverage? I am a beginner and I believe I understand the concept of Overnight Funding and leverage. 

However, I thought this would just be applied when I open a position larger than my account. I was using Plus500 (UK) and bought some stocks using their CFD worth way less than my deposit with them. I was surprised when I realized that they were charging me that. 

I would like to go long (more than 6 months) on some forex I am bullish with, and just have tried trading212 and Plus500 so far. Both seem to do the same.
