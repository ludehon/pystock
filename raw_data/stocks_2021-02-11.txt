Thanks in advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cannabis stocks tumble from multi-year highs as Reddit-fueled rally loses steam By the time markets closed on Wednesday, several pot stocks stood at their highest levels in years. Exchange-traded funds including Global X Cannabis, ETFMG Alternative Harvest, and Amplify Seymour Cannabis were the best-performing ETFs of the year to date.

The retail-trader enthusiasm now seems to have fizzled out. Profit-taking overcame the pot stock rally when the market opened on Thursday, immediately driving shares sharply lower.
The sudden reversal calls into question the Reddit traders' ability to drive sustainable rallies. The GameStop phenomenon that dominated market chatter in January similarly faded this month as those who piled in took profits or minimized losses. Wall Street Bets day traders have rallied around other stocks since, though not with the unity that fueled GameStop's surge.

There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also ample signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.

That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like "weed is dead" and "I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz."

For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.

These are not short squeeze/hype/meme stocks. Please stop looking at them as such.

Since the Government has now came forward and confirmed they are real, I have taken the time to research a company that is currently in possession of material, and has an existing Government contracts.

&#x200B;

This led me to finding the following company founded by Tom Delonge, [To the Stars Academy](https://home.tothestarsacademy.com/). This company has really stood out for me as it had the following members:

&#x200B;

1. Hal Puthoff - UFO Researcher for the Governments Secret UFO Program AATIP. You can find a long form presentation of his work on Youtube that he did after coming out to the public.
2. Lue Elizondo - Former Director of Secret UFO Program but he left the company at the end of the 2020. Left because he felt he needs to tackle UFO Secrecy through another angle, and not through a corporation. Latest interview makes it sound like he's rejoining the Pentagon to lead another research effort.
3. Christopher Mellon -  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations left for the same reasons as Lue Elizondo.

&#x200B;

The company has done the following:

1. Has UFO Materials currently being [studied](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=252612709434275).
2. Has signed a CRADA with the US [Army](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30498/the-army-wants-to-verify-to-the-stars-academys-fantastic-ufo-mystery-material-claims) for their materials.
3. Brought the now confirmed UFO videos to the [public](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/politics/navy-ufo-incident-reports/index.html)
4. Helped the US Navy create Guidelines fore reporting [UFOS](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/23/us-navy-guidelines-reporting-ufos-1375290).

They will be up for investment sometime this year and I'm hoping to purchase a thousand stocks.

Does anyone else know of another company that is investing or researching the UFO Phenomenon and have obtained any sort of Government contract? TTSA seems to be the leading company when it comes to the UFO Technology sector and Government connections.

It is one of the most active stock in the Euronext Lisbon because it is really subvalued and underrated. When I started the DD in this company the stocks were at 0.07€ and last week they passed the 0.13€ mark (it isn't a penny stock, the portuguese stocks just works this way because we're poor af). Some really big players are coming in such as Nuno Amado, a big portuguese investor that recently bought half a million shares.

Basically here we are, with a stock from the only bank listed on the Euronext Lisbon because it is the only bank that meets the requirements to do so in a historic low derivated from the whole covid situation ready to take off and go back to what it was.

Oh and in the Euronext Lisbon there are no shorts!

TL.DR - Buy BCP.LS the biggest bank in Portugal with many new clients as the other shark banks are bankrupt leaving their costumers empty handed.

A day ago, I posted a reply to another user who asked what happens to money he lost when his long stock decreased in value. That reply is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgq7qt/where\_does\_the\_money\_i\_lose\_go/gmt6zy0

My reply got a lot of responses, and evidently, I had explained it in a way that helped the concept "click" for a number of people. Another user asked me if I could try to write an explanation of "shorting" in the same ELI5 style as that other post. 

This is my attempt. This is intended to expand on the first example, so you may want to read that first. 

This is also aimed at new traders, and as such, is a bit of a simplification, and is intended to explain the concept itself, **and is clearly not investment advice**.

Let's set the stage: when we left off, the last trade taking place in the apple market was Linda selling an apple to Abobo for $0.75. The market price of an apple was then considered to be $0.75. Since then, a number of new people have entered the apple market, and currently, apples are trading for about $1.00; precisely, the bid-ask spread is $0.99/$1.01. The most someone will buy an apple for is 99 cents, and the least anyone will sell one for is $1.01. This is a narrow bid-ask, and shows that the market believes that $1 is a fair price for an apple at this time. 

One investor, Mr Badger, recently heard that a farmer (Mr Cobb) was experimenting with growing something called a "pear." Badger thinks that these funny-looking pear things might offer a competitive alternative to apples. He believes that by next year, some portion of people who are currently investing in apples might decide to sell their apples and invest in pears instead. He knows that as people become motivated to sell their apples, that this will result in the value of apples decreasing. Badger currently has 10 apples, and he doesn't want his investment to lose value, so he decides to sell his apples while they are still worth around $1. He places an order to sell his apples, and does so at the ask price (since this is the most someone is willing to pay for them). The person he sold his apples to (let's call him Simon) now has all the apples he wants, so he is no-longer bidding to buy more at $.99. The next highest bidder, an investor named Zoe, is only willing to pay $.97, so that is our new ask price.

Badger believes that it made sense to sell all of his apples. In fact, he thinks it makes so much sense that he wants to sell even more apples, but he has already sold all of the apples he owns. What if….

Badger finds another investor, named Malcolm. Malcolm believes that his 10 apples are a sound investment, and plans to continue to hold them for the next year. Malcolm knows that the value could go up or down, but he believes the value of his investment will gradually increase, given enough time. 

Malcom is "bullish" in his view of apples, while Badger is "bearish." The two investors disagree on what the value of the apples will be next year. 

Badger asks Malcolm, since Malcolm has no intent to do anything with his apples for a while, what if he loaned them to Badger? Malcolm would still own 10 apples, Badger is just interested in borrowing them for a bit. Badger even offers to pay Malcolm a small fee (interest) for letting him borrow his apples. Since Malcolm wasn't planning to do anything with his apples, he agrees to loan them to Badger, knowing that he will still own the apples, and is now getting paid by Badger. Malcolm's investment is now paying income!  

It's worth noting that Badger is borrowing 10 apples. He did not borrow any particular amount of money, only a particular number of apples. He now needs to return 10 apples back to Malcolm sometime in the future.

Badger takes these borrowed apples and now sells them! 

Badger sold the 10 apples to Zoe, at her bid of $0.97, meaning that the market value of all apples is now $0.97 and the next highest bid is Saffron's, at  $0.96. Badger now has an extra $9.70 in cash, but is in a debt of 10 apples. You could say that he has -10 apples, or that he is now "short" 10 apples. 

As it turns out, Badger was actually right. A year later, pears now make up 45% of fruit related investments, and the value of apples has declined to $0.50. Badger still owes 10 apples to Malcolm, and has paid him a total of $1 in interest during the past year. Badger feels that this is a good time to "cover," or return the apples to Malcolm. He purchases 10 apples from Kaylee for $0.50 (a total of $5) and gives them to Malcolm, repaying his apple-debt. During this time, Malcolm's investment has decreased in value, but, because he was collecting interest from Badger, a portion of the lost value was offset. Plus, he still has his apples, which he was planning to hold, anyways. 

As for Badger, he sold the apples for $9.70, paid $1 in interest, and bought apples back for $5. That means that Badger made $3.70 ($9.97-1-5= 3.70) by betting that the value of apples would decrease. Shiny!

But what if Badger was wrong? 

Badger took a risk betting against apples. All investments have risk, but short-selling has the unusual risk of nearly "infinite" losses. For example, say Badger has borrowed and sold Mal's apples, but the success of pears actually brought more investors into the fruit market. Some people likely sold their apples for pears, but with new buyers beginning to trade fruit, the market value of apples has actually increased to $1.50! 

Now, Badger realizes that his assumption was wrong, and he decides to pay back his apple-debt now, before prices potentially go even higher. He buys 10 apples for $1.50 each ($15 total), and returns them to Mal. Mal is ecstatic because he still owns 10 apples, which have now appreciated in value, plus he received another $1 from Badger for loaning him the apples. 

Badger, on the other hand, sold the apples for $9.70, paid $1 in interest, and then purchased the apples back for $15. That means that Badger lost $6.30 betting against the apple market! gǒushǐ!

In both cases, the price of apples changed by 50 cents, but when Badger was right, he only stood to gain a portion of what he lost when he was wrong. 

Now what if the price of apples had risen to $3 per apple, or even $7? Theoretically, there's no limit to how high the price of an apple could go, and regardless of the price, Badger would still eventually need to return 10 apples to Mal.  

Mal's investment can never lose more than 100% of it's value and can theoretically gain infinitely, whereas Badgers investment could never have gained more than 100% of its value, but can theoretically lose infinitely. 

That's the concept of short-selling!

 

Here are two more things to consider: 

1. You may have noticed that while Badger was short apples, both Mal and Zoe owned the SAME apples! Did badger just inflate the apple market? Not exactly. During this time, both Mal and Zoe owned a total of 20 apples, while Badger had -10. The total number of apples is actually still 10 (10+10-10=10). It might sound odd at first, but it balances out. 
2. When Badger sold the borrowed apples, he sold them at Zoe's bid. This satisfied her bid, and brought up Saffron's bid as the next highest. If Badger borrowed more apples, and sold those as well, he could satisfy Saffron's bid, and that would leave the market value of apples at $0.96. If he borrowed and sold enough, his trades would continue to lessen the market value of the apples. This would leave him in an increasing risky position, however. Each time he sells at a lower price however, his potential gains become smaller and smaller, while his potential losses (and rate of loss) become increasing high. 

I hope that made sense to any one wondering what short-selling is all about. I want to stress again that this is a simplified explanation, and is intended to communicate the concept of short selling. In real life, there are many more market forces in play, as well as regulations regarding when and how someone can short-sell an asset._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is this a good strategy? I look for OPTIONS with high Vol/OI (Volume / open interest) rates on Barchart to catch stocks where Big money has been introduced and get along with them. If there is low open interest and there pops up a big volume, it is because contrats have been opened. For example: (fak, not images allowed) Today someone bought 288.773 call contracts 2,5 strike 36 DTE of DNN stock. The actual price of DNN is 1,08. So someone is betting 6 millions USD that it would double its price in 36 days WTF... he may know something to bet that amount. 

&#x200B;

Isn´t it a good strategy to go along with those kind of positions?

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete loss as to what "up & coming" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know. 

**So what has happened**?

**Part 1** - **Gamestop**

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief. 

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.  


This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could. 

**Part 2** - **The Fallout**

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind "What stocks are the next GME?" & "Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms. 

**Part 3** - **Thesis**

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that. 

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently "seemingly" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.   


I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

&#x200B;

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.  


I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?   


Personally these are the steps I have taken. 

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple. 

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into TRX, "why", you may ask, "have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive canadian gold mining?" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Automation Level 5 Outlook for Blackberry "I don't think I'm going to buy a Level 5 car for at least 10 years," Chen said.

1. The e-commerce and cloud giant has had a $5 billion share repurchase program in place since February 2016, the last time Amazon bought back any of its stock was the first quarter of 2012, so the streak is 33 quarters of no stock buyback. But with the new ceo coming, he might change and start to repurchase the stock, remember before tim cook take over apple, apple did not give out any dividend, and then it changed. 

2. Prime member engagement keep increasing and prime membership is still growing yoy. All major product categories demand continue to raise across globally. 

3. Amazon high growing aws and advertising revenue streams are getting more profitable, the advertising division could keep growing and getting some market share from fb and google.  

4. Amazon bottom line is improving much better compared to analysts predictions, the last few quarters it beats expectations by a lot. With the covid situation getting more under control, the covid related expenses will mitigate, and amazon will be more profitable. 

5. Amazon delivery fleet is growing, I have seen my packages constantly delivered by amazon vans and contractors. In the future, amazon will be less dependent on USPS, fedex and UPS, and might even able to compete with UPS and Fedex. 

6. Finally the stock split, with the new ceo coming, this might become possible as well, this will be a positive catalyst that all investors want to see.

I will be keep holding my amazon stock, if it really dip further, I will buy more, I will hold amazon stock until I retire._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some non "frothy" stocks? Hey Fellow Investors,

I've gotten pretty lucky the past few months and made some YUGE gains on lucky guesses. I would like to rotate about 25% of my portfolio away from the lofty evaluation stocks and I just can't seem to find any good ones right now. I'm heavily invested in stuff like TSLA, NVDA, FANGM, GM, NIO, BLNK. 

Are there stocks that the retail environment has missed and are appropriately valued? I'm thinking WMT, KO, JNJ and that lot of companies. Preferably something with a bit more IV (Implied Volatility)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Message to other young investors For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my "fun" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. **All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month.** I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.

2U offers full online graduation programs for undergrad and grad students in addition to alternative credential programs like short courses and boot camps. They operate in the US, Hong Kong, South Africa, and the UK.

&#x200B;

ARK holds 18%.

&#x200B;

Currently only 1% of higher education is generated online. So, we are standing at the beginning of a transition and the pandemic just serves as a catalyst. 2U is the market leader in higher education and they are already partnered with many prestigious universities (Harvard, MIT, University of Cambridge, Yale, Berkeley, University of Oxford, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, NYU...)

&#x200B;

They are not profitable YET, but I strongly believe they can improve their margins. Marketing expenses make up the largest part of the operating expenses. Over time those will decrease (relatively) because their contracts are long-term (5 year+).

&#x200B;

The stock is sitting at $3,5bn with a price/sales ratio of about 4. The competition (CHGG and TAL) is priced at a ratio of around 10. If TWOU becomes profitable over time and continues to grow at a decent rate they could turn out to be massively undervalued.

&#x200B;

They have their earnings release today. I don't know what the stock will do in the short term, but if you are interested in a long-term play this might be a decent stock to watch.

The company offered 50 million shares, which they raised from 45 million, at $43. That came in $4 above the high end of its upwardly revised range. Before that, it initially planned to offer 34.5 million shares at a price range of $28 to $30. It received a market valuation of $8.2 billion."

Thoughts and/or prayers?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Explanation on TLRY/APHA arbitrage go get everyone on the same level - there are some more factors than you probably thought Hello community. I’ve seen some confusion around the arbitrage opportunity on the merger of APHA and TLRY. 

People throw around the number 0.8381 *a lot*. So I think it’s important to get everyone on the same page here.

APHA isn’t trading on a discount right now. It might be, but it isn’t for sure.

A common misconception to read nowadays is that „APHA is undervalued **now** because it needs to rise up to comply with the merger ratio **later**. That’s not true. The four scenarios here are the following (since the ratio now is around 0.5 instead of 0.8381):

1. APHA rises to meet merger ratio
2. TLRY drops to meet merger ratio
3. Both rise and meet the ratio there
4. Both fall and meet the ratio there

So as you See, it’s by no means a „free money situation“ to buy APHA now to profit off of the conversion to TLRY later.

What some people are missing is, that facts like price and ratio **today** don’t hold up to **at merger-day**. 

The two stocks will converge to the ratio of APHA/TLRY = 0.8381 the closer we come to the merger. Since there is no exact date yet except of „Q2/2021“, the ratios don’t converge yet. It’s as simple as that. They will converge since people will hop on the APHA-train if they see that they get a free profit off of the conversion and people jump on the TLRY-train if they see that a conversion will profit them there. In the end, the conversion will most likely not profit anyone since every opportunity is taken.

I like to hear what other thoughts are as I still learn to work out my own DD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Joint Venture Partnership Two similar companies went into a Partnership, Company A’s stock is the positive and Company B’s stock is in the negative for the day. Have 400 shares in company A, should I invest in company B as well if it’s cheap and the partner is doing really well?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who here knows how to invest in Carbon Offset Companies? Just starting my research into this space and hoping to gather info. from people who might have looked into this already. 

This space feels like a no brainer. Sentiment for companies to become carbon-neutral / carbon-negative will increase exponentially over time. I think there will be a big push for companies who want to be on the right side of history, who are pressured by their shareholders / customer sentiment. I think there will also be big pushes from government regulations for companies to invest in reducing their carbon footprint and going negative.

I'm trying to find some publicly traded companies that sell large commercial contracts for carbon offsets. Anyone knowledgeable in this space that can give me some tickers to start look into?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Answers to why did the market fall I've been seeing alot of post saying why did this happen at 10:30 or why did the market suddenly fall, to anyone new this is a completely normal occurrence, market fluctuations happen all the time. There are many reasons as to why this happens across the board, it could by high frequency trading, it could be big players taking profits it could algos, it could be many things, no one really knows, just don't panic and don't worry again this is completely normal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mid cap, low PE stocks? I’m looking for these types of stocks to invest, and really am not sure if there is a way to search for stocks like this, or if anyone has recommendations of companies that meet these parameters with good technological/innovative outlook_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does Questtrade Trailing Stop work on Options I understand how a trailing stop will work on stocks. But how does it work on options?

For example I have a call for a stock price of $20, and the option price was $6 ($600 total). When I enter in 20% as a trailing stop, what is the 20% based on?

1. The stock price of $20 = stop at $16?
2. The price of the option at $6 = stop at 4.8?
3. The cost of my trade at $600 = stop at $480?

When I set the trailing stop, what does it set as the peak?

1. The peak of the day?
2. The current price at the time I set the option? If I update the stop from 20% to 15% it would reset the peak?
3. The peak of when I bought it?

Thank you. I can't find these details online._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about trading common IPO stocks I've been a conservative investor for sometime now but have only recently started playing with some extra cash which has resulted in broadening of horizons and new experiences. I had a problem today buying an IPO debut stock and wanted to know/learn why I could not purchase it based on the data I had before trading started.

Specifically, I wanted to invest in the $BMBL IPO debut today and placed a limit buy at $48 before trading started. The IPO was priced at $43 per share so I thought that was a fair buffer. But as soon as trading started at around 12:30 pm est, the stock price shot up to $76+ with my order left unexecuted.

Do you guys have any insight on how to handle orders like this in the future? Is there something that I did wrong? Or strategies to purchase popular IPOs at the lowest opening price in general?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What kind if ETFS do you guys hold and why? In my portfolio I currently hold is 

QQQM - alternative to QQQ but cheaper/newer with less volume and fees. (held for low risk growth) 


ARKF - very bullish on this one with SQ/MELI/PINS/BABA/SE as a few of their holdings. 


SMH - also another industry im bullish on this covers the semiconductor industry with TSM / INTC / AMD / NVIDIA

What are you guys holding in terms of ETFS?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just a whole bunch of questions Hi, I've got quite a couple questions to ask, I'll try numbering them so it may be easier to answer if you just wanna answer one of them. Some of them might be stupid questions, or questions where the answer is just "it's up to you, or it depends", sorry I'm still pretty new. I'm thankful that there's a place here where newcomers like me can ask questions. 

1. I’ve recently been made aware of ARK and Cathie Wood. My question is do you guys recommend ARKK or ARKG? I do realize that they are focused on different things so “It depends” is most likely the answer I’ll get, but I thought it was still worth asking if there’s maybe one that you recommend more. 
2. Putting your money into an S&P 500 ETF seems to be very popular (VOO, SPY, etc). The ARK ETFs (more specifically looking at ARKK and ARKG) seem to perform better than the S&P 500. I assume the ARK ETFs are a bit more volatile and risky than just putting money into something like VOO, but this may be untrue. So, how much more risky is ARKK or ARKG and do you recommend putting the majority of the money you plan on investing into ETFs into VOO or should most of it be well invested in an ARK ETF?
3. When you are long on a stock and decide that you are content with your earnings and sell, do you reinvest the money you made somewhere else? Of course if you need the money then that’s that but if you don’t do you just put it in the next stock that you’re researched and think will give you a profit or do you maybe put it in a low risk ETF to sit for a while. I’m curious if people are constantly reinvesting their earnings (this question obviously highly depends on whatever YOU want to do with YOUR money so sorry if this is a bit of a stupid question, just wanna know what other people tend to do)
4. I understand exit strategy for individual stocks, take your profit when you have it, be happy, don’t get too greedy. My question once again relates to ETFs (you may be sensing a pattern). If you have an ETF with generally low risk (say an S&P 500 ETF), do you ever think about closing your long position? Again assuming you don’t have a wedding coming up or something that you need the money for, do you just keep adding some money every month and hold until you’re 60? Do you periodically realize your gains or just let the wealth accrue until you decide to exit, and when do you decide to exit?

Thanks for reading and extra thanks if you answer any of them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which is better long term investing? Looking into opening a Roth IRA and investing in some ETFs for the long haul. However, I can’t seem to determine if a S&P 500 ETF (VOO) or a total stock market ETF (VTI) would be more  beneficial? Both have similar .03% expense ratios. I keep reading total stock ETFs are more volatile which I would assume highs and lows are more drastic than a 500 ETF._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do traders lose more money than they invest? I have seen a few horror stories recently of traders who have lost huge amounts of money when it seems like they should not have been in a position to make such a high-risk trade in the first place. How does this occur?  


I'm thinking specifically about the case of a 20-year-old man from the US who killed himself after mistakenly believing he owed almost 1 million dollars from a trade. I understand that the man did not actually owe this much money but it seems insane that he should have been in a position to make such a high-risk trade in the first place. I am new to trading and am looking for information on how this can occur, how can traders with low equity be allowed to acquire so much risk in the first place? I have also seen the results of some "YOLO" trades that ended with the traders owing hundreds of thousands of dollars, how does this occur, and are there no restrictions in place to prevent this happening? Apologies if this is an obvious/beginner question._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB I think most people haven't realized how much good news $BB has announced, so I will highlight most of them now:

Get's Sony as a customer for QNX_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock market slump today Why did the stock market just sink in the last 30 minutes?  I am looking for articles or information but I can't find anything, is there a place to get information like that asap? Thanks!  I'm just so curious as to what makes the market slump instantly without there being any information out immediately, like how does that happen? I really hope that this is not considered a low tier post I just want a simple answer though.

Edit: Slump not collapse I meant.

Edit: to clarify, I'm still up for the day, and I'm not worried, I just want to know why it suddenly slumped at almost exactly 12 and where I can get up to the minute news about the market._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TDAmeritrade cash debit call I got myself into a little debit call with some trades yesterday of a few bucks. Sold some stock, and the alert on my app went away, but when I log in it still has a flag notifying me that I’m in a cash debit call of $0.00. I’m guessing that I’m in the clear, that the flag remains until the market closes, or just doesn’t update properly on the website. Phone support of course is a 90 minute wait today. Does anyone know for sure?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Douyu and Huya up 20%. Any merger news? Two popular Chinese Twitch competitors - Douyu and Huya - are both on fire today. 

There has been talk that Tencent was going to facilitate a merger between the two companies, and the deal was a target for anti-trust regulation in China.

China recently unveiled their new anti-trust rules, and I assume that is what is fueling this.

I cannot find any concrete news though.

Does anyone know what is going on and can they provide links?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can somebody explain the basis for stocks like $JDST, which was worth thousands per share and is now practically a pennystock? A friend of mine is brand new to the world of investing, and he put a good sum of money into JDST despite me telling him it’s risky. The problem is, I’m not advanced enough in the world of investing to really give him proper advice. I’ve been doing well, but I’m still learning myself.

Could somebody explain the basis behind stocks like this? I’ve seen others that say they were worth hundreds of thousands per share and then they become nearly worthless; my assumption is that most of that happens via stock splits? But again, idk enough about this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's this a sign of a bad broker? I put in a limit order for an ETF this morning. I put it in originally between the ask and bid. Waited a half hour, order status was just sitting there as "new" and the ETF meanwhile had gone up, so I edited the price to the new ask number listed. It's been hours and still no news on this other than "replaced". The original price I offered is now well below the current price. Is this normal and just something that happens, or is it a sign my discount broker is bad? Is there normally more information offered to people other than "new"?  For fast moving holdings do you normally have to replace your order a few times to keep up with price?

The other question is if Yahoo finance is showing a higher price than my broker is, should I just go with Yahoo price?

Value? The rumors around the Bumble IPO price have been highly speculative. 

While $20-30/share was bounced around, $43 was the IPO premarket. It's now being offered publically at $76.50 asking per my trading platform. That's roughly half the ask of much more established conglomerate brand Match ($MTCH).

**Some (newb) DD:**

ATD has maintained it's massive, consistent growth through acquisitions.  They are currently trading lower than their average price due to a deal falling through with a French retailer (Carrefour).  The only reason this deal fell through was that the French government blocked it.  Nothing to do with the money, or the companies themselves.

ATD is currently sitting on BILLIONS (2.5-3.5?) of dollars in cash, just waiting to stretch its legs into other markets.  
ATD is the largest provider of EV charging stations in Norway (which has had the most successful EV rollout in the world). They want to expand this outwards, and are looking towards the U.S. to do so. https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/circle-k-loves-norway-we-re-ready--805591037.html 

**Possible Catalysts:**

**Up:**

1) Any news of a new acquisition in the works.

2) Any news of large-scale EV network expansion.

3) Good pandemic news, less lockdowns = more foot traffic and driving. 

4) U.S. Weed legalization.  ATD owns 15% of Fire & Flower ($FAF), a cannabis retailer based out of Alberta.

**Down:**

1) Oil prices plummeting. 

2) New strains of COVID, decreasing foot traffic in their stores.

edit: Position: Long 139 shares at an average of $39.85_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Setting up order to both protect from loss and capture profit at exit point Is there a way to set up one order to both sell at a stop point or at a limit? Say for example I bought a stock at $10. I'd like to set up an order that will essentially do a stop if it drops to $9, protecting me from loss, and a limit if it hits my exit goal of $15. Numbers are random of course.

I assumed a stop limit did that, but I tried it today and discovered that's not the case. It seems like it'd be a pretty desirable option. But it looks like I can only do one or the other. I can't set up both a limit and stop on the same shares, and a stop limit doesn't do that either._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long-term pot stocks to buy?

I am new to investing, and trying to be smart and do some research but there's so much! I don't have a ton of money to invest so I've been going after some penny stocks trying to make a quick buck, but also want to be smart and get some long term investments.


I bought into the hype of another pot stock, and hate to be part of a pump and dump in an industry I believe in, but I'm realizing that company is not the one to go with for long-term growth. I plan on doing more of my own research, but I'm a little overwhelmed and still trying to learn what to even look for when investing in a company.

&#x200B;

The Company in question is called Vuzix or $VUZI. I know its a cute ticker but these mofo's are tough. This stock is a real money maker. The first thing you'll notice is probably that it's gone up 300% in the last 3 months but ill explain everything including why thats awesome (hint: they got some sweet deals with big pharma)

&#x200B;

So history time. They have been in business working on the frontline of technology since 1997. They've been developing VR technology for over a decade and hold 179 patens for VR lens, headsets, goggles, literally everything you can imagine they have a patent on. They also have patents on AR glasses and tech for them. 

&#x200B;

Why is this important? Because most of the world arent VR gamers, and VUZI specifically targets VR thats not for gamers. Here's a quote from the link below: 

"In fact, there are already frontline health-care professionals around the world using Vuzix’s smart glasses, and the company’s list of health-care customers continues to grow."  

They are producing technology that is actually being used in the field, and with the ever growing demand for VR for practical uses (ie NOT play withselves to virtual anime chick), VUZI is in prime position to slurp up market space and continue growing. I don't know about you but after I like to invest in companies that A. are actually making money and B. have a real product that is selling well.

&#x200B;

How is their balance sheet you ask? A lot better now than it was a year ago. According to the article below they went from a negative 200k gross return to a positive gross 300k return in just one year which is pretty darn good.

&#x200B;

The real shit though is found in AR. This is a market space that hasn't even begun to grow yet. Analysts are estimating that it will be a 77 billion dollar market by 2025 and VUZI is already tapping this market now!! If you go to their website which is the second link, you can see they offer glasses for warehouses and medical fields that can scan barcodes and determine what a product is which is pretty sick and definitely the stuff of the future. They also recently began developing sports wear AR goggles for skiing and more athletics wear is likely to come in the future.  I'm extremely optimistic about this company though. The best part is that it's on a little sale today. I'm actively looking to buy more but the premiums on the calls are a little high at the moment, so I'm loading on regular shares now. 

&#x200B;

Pos. 125 @ 13

TL DR  Vuzix is an incredibly well positioned AR / VR tech company that has a good track record, consistent income, a lot of patents, and products in the field already. It's very cheap right now and has huge potential

Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.

**Something about crayons.**

I found this on Stocktwits. Do what you will with it.

(Apparently this subreddit doesn't allow images. The image showed a chart of RIDE about to bust put. We are in the middle of that price increase now).

I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/08/2020) at $39.65 while RIDE is at $27.40. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.

**What makes them different**

Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).

**What does your crystal ball tell you?**

Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.

**Catalysts**

March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.

Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.

September The beginning of live production.

**Price targets**

Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.

Anyone have any info on why they’re shooting up?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The truth about marijuana stocks I see a lot of posts and comments about weed stocks on this sub. According to most people all across reddit, cannabis is supposed to be the next "stock that shall not be named" and is supposed to go to the moon in a short amount of time. 

Let me start off by saying this. Absolutely anything could happen and just because it is low probability doesn't mean it cant happen. But with that being said, I can almost guarantee you that cannabis will not be legalized this year. In fact it would be a safer bet to say that it wont happen for another 4-10 years.

Everytime we see an election, cannabis is in all of the headlines, all of the time. A couple states might legalize it, and then just like every other time this has happened, it flatlines and you hear nothing for a couple years. Every time without fail. Everyone thinks that the first thing a new president wants to do is legalize weed. That is not, and will never be the case.

Joe biden is no different. Joe biden has been against weed for 50 years in the public eye. His running mate Kamala Harris has been on legitimate news channels laughing about incarcerating people for smoking weed.

If joe biden does make a push for legalization, you can bet your life savings on it being a popularity stunt. Maybe mid term when he feels his followers arent backing him, maybe when it's time to run it back for a new election. But he WILL NOT do it for any reason other than popularity.

You have not missed the hype train. Weed stocks WILL go back down. If you want to get in now by all means, do it and HOLD. You will NOT get rich overnight with cannabis stocks. Regardless of how much reddit forces cannabis stocks on you, this is not a buy low and flip it in a week to sell high. If you want to invest in cannabis, it will be buy and hold. For several years. I promise you. 

Dont let the hype get to you. Cannabis is long term, and will be legalized eventually, but for now and the near future,  hold your horses._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Earnings plays WMT then COST Earnings play WMT Then COST

Essentially, the technology creates the revolutionary potential to address the limitations of conventional medicines with low stability and low solubility. Many medicines require water, refrigeration, larger dosing and with an inconvenient delivery method(IV, rectal, etc). The Xeri-technology solves these problems. The technology converts existing "unstable" formulations(vaccines, antibodies, proteins, peptides and small molecules) into stable non-aqueous easy to use injectables.

Severe Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition where the blood glucose levels fall below specified limits and must be treated immediately with emergency Glucagon. These situations should be treated very similarly to utilizing an Epi-Pen during an allergic reaction. Xeris employed the use of their XeriSol technology to convert the unstable, inconvenient, and risky conventional glucagon emergency kits into the first and only easy-to-use, non-aqueous pre-filled Syringe and autoinjector.

Morning all,

I can't imagine this is allowed or I feel like it would be more well known. I'm going to pop my 2020 and 2021 $6K into Traditional IRA (non deductible), then roll it over into Roth as soon as able (figure within a day).

I've always done this in cash, which I presume is only option...

That said, do you now if we can transfer securities? One stock for example I'm way up on, so I'd transfer over as close to $6K worth for each year contribution, then fill missing with cash to max it. I'd assume if this is possible it's based on current value (wouldn't it be glorious if it was based on original value though?).

I feel like this would be such a good thing that it would have to show up in Reddit posts monthly as a FYI do this, sorta like how often a Roth is preached.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fellas, I have a question regarding taxes on long-term investments. 
I’m basically new to the stock market and have been doing some real in-depth research into it. For the past two weeks or so, I’ve been gathering an extensive amount of data regarding both and while I’m learning a shit ton, lots and lots of questions are also on the horizon. 

So it is to my understanding that generally, lower taxes are paid on long term investments, correct? 

So, let’s say I buy ‘xx’ stock and hold it for over two years and make a couple thousand in profit. Right here, I’d be paying less in taxes compared to reaping my profits in nothing short of a year. 

Let’s say though, I choose to not keep those profits and instead, re-invest those same profits into another company? (or perhaps the same one)

Will my tax rates still be the same considering I made profits on my original long term investment or would it be lower as I’m not really choosing to keep the profit but applying it elsewhere? 

Can’t seem to find anything regarding this specific question so what better place than to ask here. As a newbie doing his research, any tips/recommendations or anything unrelated to this question is for sure welcome!

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record high close

> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay “patiently accommodative” to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is “a long way” from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

*****

> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday’s closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber’s ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray’s short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday’s premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

*****

> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she’ll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That’s an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

*****

> # 5. House impeachment managers to continue their case against Trump

> * House managers on Thursday are set to continue to lay out their case against former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial. Trump’s lawyers are expected to launch their defense by the end of the week. Chilling security video of last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, including scenes of rioters searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was introduced Wednesday as a key exhibit by Democratic lawmakers prosecuting the case for why Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.

[Link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-tried-to-buy-pinterest-in-recent-months-report-11613018910)

Microsoft Corp. made overtures to buy Pinterest Inc. in recent months, the Financial Times reported Wednesday night.

The acquisition talks are not currently active, the FT reported, adding that in the past Pinterest has signaled its preference to remain an independent company. The FT reported that Microsoft’s acquisition strategy is targeting active online communities that it can pair with its cloud platform.

Pinterest PINS, +2.15% has a current market valuation of about $50 billion, bolstered by a 36% rise in its shares over the past three months.

I think this is great news for the company, and shows its potential._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MSOS – Regarding having a chunk of its holdings in a liquidity trust I’ve seen a lot of people post about being wary of MSOS and YOLO because a certain percentage of their holdings are in a liquidity trust. This is confusing and I wanted to set the record straight on why this is.

A little background for those who are unfamiliar, MSOS is the only actively managed cannabis fund with only US exposure. YOLO is essentially the same but includes Canadian exposure and a bit of UK. Dan Ahrens, manager of both of these funds, was a guest on “The Cannabis Investing Podcast” and spoke to this holding. I typed out what he said below. Keep in mind this was recorded in August 2019 so some of the details with companies may be a little dated, but the main concept and investment strategy is still 100% relevant. There is a TL;DR below if you’d prefer.

“Our fund, YOLO, is really the only fund out there so far that is getting exposure to some of these MSOs (multi-state operators). A great example is Curaleaf with the acquisition that was just announced is going to be the largest cannabis company in the world by sales. We have companies operating in the US but they’re listed on the Canadian stock exchange and can’t get listed on the Toronto yet or NASDAQ or NYSE because of these very complicated murkey federal laws. In our fund, you know it’s very prominent in our principle investment strategies that we aren’t only going to invest directly in stocks that are listed as federally legal and listed on certain exchanges. We’re also going to use derivatives, futures, options, swaps, to gain exposure to stocks with similar characteristics. So we have a third party that buys the stocks, gives us back the return of those in a total return swap. Because it’s very important that we have exposure to companies like Curaleaf, and Harvest Health, and Green Thumb Industries. Very sizeable companies operating in the US, because the US market, as you said, it’s not just bigger than Canada. It’s many, many, many times bigger than Canada. Everyone got excited about Canada because that’s where the public stocks that we could invest are, and they passed recreational use, but we have to remember it’s a tiny market compared to the United States and the worldwide market.”

When asked about these swaps appearing as trusts and funds in the holdings:

“that’s the amount of cash to cover the swap. So we are getting into the weeds here a little bit, **but I want to point out that what we’re doing is virtually the same as if you owned the stock. We aren’t going to lever it up or have leverage. That’s the amount of cash that’s being held and is always going to be equal to the amount that we own in a stock swap.**”

**TL;DR**: the trust privately invests in certain companies that cannot legally be listed on an exchange yet, and YOLO and MSOS hold the trust. It all balances out in the end.

Side note, at the time of this recording MSOS wasn’t in existence yet, so you can now get purely US exposure with that one. I’ve held these two for some time now, and I was admittedly getting a bit of FOMO when they underperformed some of the other weed ETFs this week, but I still think these have more upside potential as they are investing in US companies that are currently difficult to invest in. Once they get the greenlight to be on a common exchange, I think we will see a similar surge with YOLO and MSOS that we saw this week with the global weed ETFs. In fact, some of the companies mentioned above ARE listed now, and they’ve been soaring with the rest of them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UCITS ETFs: EUR vs. USD and does stock exchange matter?  Hey there,

I am passive, "hold forever" investor, naturally preferring ETFs. But, as an European investor, I basically have to pick from UCITS ETFs. What confused me a bit is "how it works" when one ETF is listed on multiple exchanges and in multiple currencies (typically EUR and USD). If the fund (physically) replicates an index, in means it buys the stocks. So once I buy my share, does it matter what currency or what exchange did I use? Are there reasons I should care, if I buy for EUR or USD, and on what exchange (I mean London SE vs. XETRA vs. SIX, not some obscure ones).

For example, I am looking at  [iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?groupField=none&dc=IE&assetClass=class-equity&sortField=fundSize&sortOrder=desc&from=search&isin=IE00B1XNHC34#listing). What ticker on what exchange should I buy, and why?

I’m a young investor (early 20’s) and I’ve been investing since I turned 18. Nothing crazy, usually just ETFs or blue chip stocks and my account had grown pretty well (who knows how much of that is my stock selection skill vs just the entire bull market being in my favor).

3. Do DD on long term strategies: I need a detailed, chronological, overview of a specific company or product/technology.

This isn’t my usual kind of post, but man, I can’t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Let’s start by talking about who Tom Nash is & says he is. He is a new & trendy “finance & stock market” YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.

In the video he is claiming he is a former “senior financial analyst” which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.

So let’s go through the **5 reasons** I believe he is lying about his past & why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:

**1)  Let’s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed**

Even though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it’s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.

I was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it’s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn’t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?

I’ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations & how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.

Here are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,

[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF

[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \- I’ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let’s continue…

[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.

But yeah guys, this isn’t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don’t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I’m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.

The other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.

He is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it’s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.

But who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn’t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.

Just for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn’t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.

So, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don’t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.

**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past?**

[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)

As you Can see, I don’t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful “Senior” Financial analyst & consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.

Also, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn’t really help the small guys.

His YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru’s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn’t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.

I also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.

His main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn’t for a financial company, it’s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:

[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let’s continue

[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn’t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner & logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips & tutorials)

[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie & hide?

[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \-  Well… Nothing to hide then… He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture & and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over & over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.

And even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.

Maybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.

[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \- So… A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can’t take more of this so let’s move to the next reasons

**3) Getting in front of the lie?**

I believe that’s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.

In the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn’t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested

But, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?

He also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses & other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.

**4) Claims about his past**

I also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel & doing Fiverr gigs, I don’t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.

I also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills & endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.

But I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn’t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming & YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it’s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.

So yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.

**5) The Transformation**

He has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second & third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.

I also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing & social media, nothing about finance yet again.

# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious & fishy person out there, he is one of them.

I believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.

Most of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.

There are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant & analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.

Folks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.

So yeah guys, I don’t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past & his financial methods & just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert & genius**, while in a bear market you can’t find any of these people as they all flee.

**Later edit: He has currently disabled his Fiverr gigs, learned Russian and deleted the profile image LOL**

Especially regarding AMD/Nvidia/Intel there are big differences regarding the prices of a single share.
As I understand, every company can divide and unite shares at any given moment, therefore change the price drastically.

I was initially sparked to do research on Arista after reading some of Michael Shearn’s thoughts on the business in his investor letters. Charlie Munger has done some of his biggest investments in people/businesses that he believes are organizationally different, whether it’s the culture, incentives the CEO/founder or all three (think Costco, BYD, Warren Buffett, Li Lu), the company operates in a different way to incumbents. I think Arista also operates in a very different way to incumbents.

Research on Arista included his writings, extensive Factiva digging, Glassdoor reviews, a couple of books (Arista Warrior, Arista Way), YouTube videos with Jayshree Ullal, Andy Bechtolsheim, Ken Duda, etc., annual reports, shareholder letters, etc. there is quite a lot of evidence that indicates Arista is both culturally and organizationally different.

My observation stems from looking at the fact that: (1) The company was not VC funded and was instead funded by wealthy individuals that focused on quality instead of deadlines - thereby not releasing a product for 4 years – which in itself sets a "tone" in terms of what is expected from their employees; (2) even though the founders were very wealthy their first office was at the basement of a law building; (3) all C-level executives have the same base salary; (4) there’s a flat hierarchy, where employees have access to C-level executives easily (described in many Glassdoor reviews); (5) Ken Duda made a bold decision not to have a QA/QC team and describing it as a fundamentally flawed concept. The QA decision was particularly interesting. It reduces bureaucracy (office politics, not knowing who to blame, etc.) and increases accountability; and (6) CEO and other C-level executives contribute, with respect, in internal technical threads. In addition to that, I don’t think you would hear any software engineer claiming culture is the most important aspect in writing quality code – but Ken Duda did.

Good morning everyone. I have just gotten into trading and have made some decent profits and I am now trying to figure out if this a good way to manage my risk and make a consistent, sustainable profit.   
All of  these numbers are based on AMC ( I chose it as an example of high IV) at $5.65, buying 2000 shares and selling 20 Covered Calls contracts with a strike price of $7 and purchasing 20 puts contracts  with a strike price of $5 all expiring on March 12th. All of these prices are based off of markets on Feb. 11th.  


Stock cost = $11300

Put cost = $2000

Total Cost $13300

Covered Call premiums = $2400

&#x200B;

**Scenarios**

**Price stays between $4-$7:**

\- Puts expire worthless

\- Covered calls expire and shares are returned

\- CC premium covers expired puts.

\- Retain stock at near identical price point and make $400 profit.

\- Will lose money if price stays between $4-$5.50 unless I sell my puts at a good price before the Theta erodes the value

*$13 per day*

**Price goes above $7:**

\- Puts expire worthless

\- Covered calls could be executed at anything above $8.20 giving a profit of $2700 for stock investment

\- Retain premium of $2400

\- Premium and sold stock cover puts making a profit of $3100

*$106 per day*

or

\-Covered calls are not executed (estimated $7.50), stock value has increased by $1000 and the total profit is $1400

*$48 per day*

**Price goes  below $4:**

\- Anything under a $4 price point is profit on puts ($3.50 = $500 profit)

\- CC expire and retain premium

\- stock returned with loss of $4300 ($3.50 price point)

\- CC premium and Put profits cover stock loss with a profit of $600

Again I am pretty new to this so I wanted some advice/criticism on this idea. Please let me know if I am missing anything or have misunderstood something. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the bull thesis on dropbox? A friend suggested I should look into dropbox, so I did, briefly. As far as I can tell, it's buried in red flags. But I'm anything but an analyst so I need to run this by someone else to check my sanity.

They do look like they're crossing into profitability, which might seem okay since they only IPO'd two years ago, but dropbox has been around for well over ten years now. Their net income growth looks glacial in pace.

Liabilities seem okay on the surface, at about 20% of their market cap, but that brings me to my real concern: valuation.

At a 10B market cap, their PE is like 123. That's a pretty substantial "expected growth" ratio. I don't see anything in their historical financial data that can justify the required growth in a <5 year timeline. Dividing their market cap by 3 to bring down their PE to a more reasonable 60 would increase their liabilities to 60%.

They actually lost market share over covid/quarantine, which should have been ideal conditions for them to have a huge growth spurt, and I think it's easy to see why.

There is zero moat. Microsoft teams alone should be able to blow them out of the water. I just can't see how this company would be a serious consideration in this sector, but there seem to be enough investors who do and I just don't get it. I must be missing something.

So something has been bothering me for a few months now. When someone shorts a company they essentially sell the stock. This drives the price down because the stock is getting sold.

I’m fairly new to the stock market but one thing I’ve been able to learn quickly is that it seems like most stocks are considered overvalued relative to its accounting sheet. Though what exactly makes this a bad thing? 

It seems like above all else, what determines a stock price is it’s perception from investors. In this case,  wouldn’t something like debt or lower revenue drive price down simply because investors perceive other investors will sell because of this news? 

If investors of a stock all decided fo ignore fundamentals, could you create a stock that grows indefinitely? Would this be a bubble and if so, what would trigger a pop? Even if something caused its price to descend,  if enough investors ignored this trend and decided to just hold would this limit a long lasting drop in price? Additionally,  couldn't others see the dip as an opportunity to buy in driving up the price even more?

I guess my key takeaway is that it seems as if its in most investors interest to believe stocks will do well, so despite year after year with talks about a bubble pop, if everyone just ignores the fact that stocks are significantly overvalued then wouldn't it never drop? In which case,  whose to say then that a stock is overvalued? Isn't value then just whatever we agree on?

I appreciate it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For those who are thinking of picking up some TLRY/APHA as a momentum play **Have been holding and adding in tranches $TLRY and $APHA since Nov-Dec, for new buyers atm, I'd advise getting $TLRY for short term due to the current situation**   


**Firstly, let me say that this is specific advise for a short term play (in and out by next Friday latest) and I think there is serious (75-125% returns in 1 week) profit potential still left on the table even at current after hours prices.**

My total position atm is

500 $TLRY Average $20.8  
1200 $APHA Average $10.1

I'm aiming to hold TLRY until \~$145 per stock and APHA to \~$45 per stock

The reason I would recommend people to still enter the stock atm

1. A lot of potential for more upside, just 1 piece of good news/announcement/tweet could send this rocketing up  
**2) Lunar New Year is happening this weekend and stocks historically tend to go up right after. This might seem insignificant but it's actually quite a big factor since a lot of Asian countries like Korean, Japan, HK, Singapore have many wealthy retail traders who are just now getting news of this rush and are starting to buy now/over the next few days. A bit like how the international rush of money into GME only happened a bit after the US rush**

Not to directly compare this to the rush of money into the "over shorted meme stocks" recently, but if there was a time period comparison, I would say we are currently at the equivalent point of Friday, 22 Jan at the moment. 1 big catalyst coming out such as Elon Musk tweeting, a Republican senator supporting federal legalization, etc and we'll see a massive upwards surge into the \~$150 range for TLRY.  
Even without an obvious catalyst, I think there will be a natural surge over next few days and the weekend to \~$100 because of later buyers entering now, especially from international countries.

The reason I would recommend new entrants atm to buy TLRY over APHA is

1. Short ammount (TLRY is much more shorted, \~50%. This opens the door to a chain effect situation where continued price increase will force shorts to cover and lead to even greater returns)
2. Hype, TLRY is the headline name (kinda like GME was for the WSB situation) and this means that in general for the next few days-week, it will likely go up higher/faster than APHA so if you're in for short term gains, choose this

This is partly caused by the fact that the eventual ticker after the merger will be TLRY

3) If Elon Musk/some other notable influencer does a positive tweet, he/she is most likely to reference TLRY and this could cause an instant huge bump in stock price which will affect TLRY much more than the other marijuana stocks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in a chapter 11 company? I have been considering investing in Valaris oil company.  They are the largest offshore drilling company in the world.  However, currently, they are undergoing chapter 11 bankruptcy and their stock is dirt cheap.  I am hoping that their stock could rebound long-term for a significant profit.  Their stock started declining when the 2014 oil crash hit, and the pandemic has really knocked many struggling oil companies for a loop due to depressed demand.  I don’t think this combination will be in play forever.  Prior to the 2014 crash, Valaris stock had reached over $200 at times.  There is the threat of renewable energy, but I imagine that these will take some time to switch over to.

I know very little about investing in companies that are reorganizing, however.  I understand that a chapter 11 company will put out new equity and the old shareholders get a small stake in the new company, in Valaris’ case it is
something like 0.1 percent.  However, I don’t know what this means practically for shareholders or for the price of shares.

So it was cool to find that I still had a bunch of shares I'd forgotten about but, as you can see, I'd purchased these at much higher points and I lost a good deal of my purchase power. It'll take a while to break even with ERBB, HEMP, VAPE, and OSLH is defunct as of  July '17. Glad to see MJNA is doing okay, but I'm sad to see that I bought ERBB @ $10/share and it's now worth 2c/share lol. I'm new to this sub and I'm trying to recover my TD password to check there.

I thought this was amusing/funny and wanted to share._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is a normal market like? I started investing in early 2020, and a lot of us have also started investing in 2020 and 2021, so basically we only have experience in a hyper-bull market where money is constantly being printed and injected into the stock market, to a point where 40% of all dollars were printed in 2020, with 0.25% interest rates and hype around every stock and 2,000 checks being handed out for people to invest in them. 

What is a normal market like? I have no experience investing in periods like 2001-2007, 2010-2019, 1982-1990, 1991-1998, so what is it like? Do P/E ratios actually matter?

As investors, we often look at the moves we've made and judge ourselves on what we missed on or what we hit on. This is part of growing and learning as an investor.

But the thing that many people forget is the **almost** trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn't. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but *something* made us pass on it. 

#Write them down.#

Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn't make the trade.

This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, "man - if only I held this longer" or "I really messed up buying this on the rise". But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn't a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.

If you don't record the moves you **almost** made, then you're missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.

Hope this can help others as much as it's helped me. Good luck y'all!

Clubhouse, $API, and the future of this tech Note: I work in tech and sometimes take a deeper look into apps and how they work: monitoring network traffic, extracting and looking through app files, etc. 

**Summary**

Clubhouse is a "drop-in audio chat" app. I'm sure most of you on here sub are aware of it, especially with some of the recent high-profile users like Elon, Zuck, etc.

I was lucky enough to join in August and immediately saw the potential but doubted it would last 12 months given the app's clunkiness (and what looked to be a poorly-built backend) as well as the obvious threat of competition from established social networks and other apps.

There's also the little secret that the actual app itself is mostly just a wrapper around a third-party service... but more on that in a second.

**Who else is in this space?**

Go to your phone's app store and search for social audio/drop-in audio chat/etc. Also take a look through the popular apps in the social category.

* **Twitter** has a competing product: Spaces. Announced late November and soft-launched late December, it looks/feels better and has some functionality Clubhouse is sorely lacking, but it doesn't seem to fulfill the same purpose (which may be intentional). The rooms I've been in have frequently devolved into circular discussions on how Spaces compares to Clubhouse.
* **Facebook** has still failed to deliver a competing product but is reportedly working on a direct competitor (Fireside). The timing of this report is interesting giving Zuck's recent appearance on Clubhouse. He reportedly struggled to understand the app.

The FB news is also *surprisingly late*. Clubhouse is 10+ months old but I guess 2020 moved too fast and broke too many things: resources were stretched thin, their rollouts were slow or messy, even breaking many major third-party apps like Spotify on two occasions (one incident [lasted a few hours](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/a-mistake-at-facebook-broke-spotify-venmo-tiktok-and-other-iphone-apps/)). It seems more like Facebook was blindsided by this (on top of everything else).

**How big is it?**

Clubhouse went from \~10k to \~100k users from August to November, it passed the one million mark just over a month ago and is on track to pass 20 million by March.

It seems like everyone is rushing into the social audio space, but the technology and infrastructure required for the core functionality of these apps is costly to build, manage, and run reliably, so just about all of them make heavy use of third-party services for that.

**Which companies provide services for these apps?**

Two publicly-traded companies are Twilio ($TWLO) and Agora ($API), with the latter being the one to watch.

You could say Agora is sort of a *Clubhouse-as-a-Service*, but it's probably more accurate to say the Clubhouse app is largely just a wrapper around the Agora platform, at least on a technical level.

From personal experience talking with founders and software engineers, Agora is what people are choosing when building social audio apps, while Twilio is generally dismissed when I've mentioned it (due to pricing IIRC).

**Note: It looks like $API hadn't really moved much since it's June IPO — until Friday — and few are really aware of just how crucial Agora's services are to Clubhouse.**

**Some media outlets** [**still seem unsure**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/agora-shares-soar-as-investors-try-to-jump-on-clubhouse-apps-growth.html) **if Clubhouse uses Agora.** Fortunately you can independently confirm it does by monitoring your phone's network traffic while using the app, or digging into the app file if you have the ability to do so.

It also looks like Clubhouse uses Agora's RTM service, likely for managing room data and keeping things in sync such as who's in a room, # of listeners, access/permissions, etc.

**Concerns?**

And finally the most speculative part of this post.

Please feel free to chime in on anything here:

* Agora's pricing is competitive, but it's still a cost — likely a significant cost at Clubhouse scale. It also seems unlikely CH would rely so heavily on another service for its core features without strong agreements in place.
* Clubhouse could eventually develop its own software and infrastructure — but considering the team is so small (\~10 employees) and growth is high, it's probably not very high on their list of priorities. However, they *are* putting a focus on monetization.
* After a huge influx of users from mainland China recently, access to Clubhouse was blocked by the Chinese government. However, it should be noted that **Agora Inc is a Chinese company.**
* The high number of Chinese users despite the many hurdles (iPhone only, app not available on the Chinese App Store, app not in Chinese) suggests high demand in that market for such apps. Could Clubhouse's continued use of Agora win favor with the Chinese government and potential access to the Chinese market? If not, might Agora be the primary choice for a Chinese alternative(s)?
* Considering the growth in this category, there's likely to be some serious competition. Are there any other relevant companies on your radar?
* Will a "post-COVID" world significantly affect this category of tech? I don't believe it will but I'm open to other viewpoints.

Final thought: this post talks about Clubhouse and Agora more than other companies, but this discussion is ultimately about the future of these technologies and services and whichever companies provide them well.

I have no affiliations and no other financial interests relevant to the topic of this post or any of the companies mentioned._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Trap of Results-Oriented Thinking Imagine you are faced with two buttons that you can press, and you can only press one:

**Button A: You have a 50% chance to win $10,000**

**Button B: You have a .00000001% Chance to win $10,000,000**

What is the better option? Well probably Button A, but let's turn to basic probability theory to be precise. Treating it as an expected value problem, we find:

Button A: $10,000 * .5 = $5,000

Button B: $10,000,000 * .00000001% = $.001

Button A is the better choice 100% of the time. If you were given the option, you'd probably press button A.

However, imagine a world where you, making the right choice, chose button A and lost the 50/50 chance and didn't even win the $10,000. Then, someone steps up right after you, and after thinking for a bit, presses button B thinking it's the better choice.

**He wins.**

Confetti flies everywhere, his family is around to congratulate him and tell him how awesome he is. Everyone thinks he's a genius because hey, he has $10 Million and you have none.

As far as I can tell we are in the midst of the biggest economy recovery since WW2._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD for Rubicon Technology RBCN Rubicon Technology (RBCN) is a relatively forgotten stock. Extremely low volume, low float, small market cap.

I was turned onto this stock by my financial planner. He did not give me much background so I did some digging today before taking a starter position of 225 shares at $10.95.

Rubicon is a manufacturer of sapphire products for optical systems and specialty electronic devices. Think cell phone screens. Their products have applications in consumer electronics, aerospace, semiconductors etc.

They do not do huge business only approximately $5mill revenue for 2020, but they only have a $26mill market cap.

Here is the interesting thing. They ran at a net loss for the 9 months ending Q3 of ($696k), but they are sitting on over $10mill in cash/equivalents and $14mill plus of short term investments (treasuries). 

About two years ago they acquired another company called Direct Dose RX. Direct Dose Rx is a specialized pharmacy that provides prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and vitamins to patients being discharged from skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and directly to retail customers who want such medications delivered to their home. The delivered products are sorted by the dose, date and time to be taken and come in easy to use perforated strip-packaging as opposed to separate pill bottles.

This business currently makes up about 20% of Rubicon's total revenue. The pharmacy business has grown over 250% in Q3 2020 vs. Q3 2019 and over 400% in the 1st 9 months of 2020 vs the first 9 months of 2019. It is obviously a growing segment and they are currently only licensed in 11 states.

Now Rubicon is focused on diversification and increasing stockholder value and is sitting on $25mill in cash/investments.

In a press release on Dec 16th the CEO announced a $3mill share buyback to take place over the next 2 years. " In our opinion, shares of Rubicon’s common stock are currently trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and it is a good use of our capital to repurchase our common stock at favorable prices"

The release also mentioned: "Rubicon is also exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including potentially through acquiring an existing business, establishing a new venture, or other investment opportunities"

With RBCN's pharmacy business growing larger by the quarter and their assets outweighing their market cap by 20% I see an opportunity for growth here. I expect higher than anticipated earnings from their pharmacy business when we get Q4 earnings. 

With such a low float and small market cap, a little volume can really get this ticker moving. I want to be in before they announce whatever their next move might be. 

With such a low cap, this could also be ripe for some type of reverse merger. Possibly something medical related where the pharmacy arm stays and the Sapphire business gets split off, similar to what happened with AMRH/Jay Pharma.

Basically what I’m trying to ask, and I know many others are curious as well, is there time to buy still?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Look at the FDA Approval Process and How it Affects Your Investments I’ve been wanting to do a post like this for a long time now. Now that healthcare has basically been the hottest thing for the last year (and somehow still getting even hotter), I thought it would be a good time. Many people try to buy into pharmaceutical companies around FDA approval targets without truly understanding what they’re getting into. Full disclosure, I am a doctor, but I will try to write this in layman’s terms as much as possible. If I get anything wrong, I’ll be sure to edit the post. To the best of my knowledge, everything I am about to say is researched (and therefore correct).

I’m going to go through the entire FDA approval process as a timeline, and then at the end, talk about other things to consider when investing in pharmaceuticals (i.e., more nuanced stuff that requires/applies healthcare understanding). One caveat here is people use “phases” in multiple ways. The way I will use it is the way I see most often being used in press releases and DD on reddit.

**Preclinical**: to begin, you must submit a proposal that basically states why you think a biologic compound will work. Without getting too technical, the preclinical is basically where you demonstrate a proof of concept. 

Here is a very generic example: Let’s say that HIV binds to GME receptor on cells. I have been doing petri dish experiments on a compound I created that prevents anything from binding to GME (this is *in vitro* if you ever see that term tossed around). I submit this evidence to the FDA and say that I think my compound will work in theory. TONS of things work *in vitro* and never progress beyond that. At this point, the FDA says, “okay we think your compound might work too, you can start human trials.”

> Investor takeaway: the results of this phase mean absolutely nothing. If a drug failed in this phase, that would truly mean the company is incompetent in both their ability to assess the science, and in their ability to provide meaningful news to generate investor buzz. 

**Phase 1**: Anything that passes preclinical is ready for human trials. We are talking very small trials, like less than 100 people. For smaller companies, this is their chance to get some hype about their pharmaceutical. For anyone who understands the process, this is truly meaningless. Again, working in vitro does not (and likely will not) translate to working in humans. This phase typically lasts several months and is primarily designed to ensure that the drug is safe.

Here is a real life example, one that has already garnered a lot of attention: Atossa Therapeutics (ATOS) and their new breast cancer drug. Here is where medical knowledge (or solid research) can really help you. Their new breast cancer drug is called endoxifen. There are already multiple analogues (drugs that work in exactly the same way with minor differences in their chemical structures) on the market. Given the number of safe analogues on the market, it is likely (but not certain) this drug will be safe for human use. It is important to note here that phase 1 trials may be done on healthy participants without any disease, solely to test for safety. Accordingly, passage through phase 1 still may not demonstrate proof of concept on humans who have a particular disease.

Let’s say that ATOS had announced its intention to start testing breast cancer treatment and initiate phase 1 trials. Like I said, the likelihood of success is pretty high given the success of previous analogues. On the other hand the downside is huge. Companies can essentially go bankrupt at this stage if their “sure thing” drug or medical device fails. Always be sure to look at risk vs reward. A drug that enters phase 1 only has around a **14% likelihood** of making it all the way to FDA approval. Certain categories of drugs like those that treat cancer have even lower success rates (3.4%). While FDA drug approval does appear to be increasing **more than 80% of drugs that enter this stage will never see market.**

>Investor takeaway: the road from here is super long and passing this phase really can’t tell you anything about its success in further stages. Many drugs are analogues and breeze through this phase, it is important not to get too hyped on them for that reason. 

**Phase 2**: Unlike phase 1 that focuses on drug safety, phase 2 tests the efficacy of the drug you are studying. This phase will typically have less than 1,000 participants, but they will all have the disease of interest. In this phase, we are looking to ensure that the drug works (provides statistically significant improvement) and is relatively safe as far as side effects. To limit research bias, sometimes we will divide the participants and give some the drug and keep some as the control group (they may get a placebo or no drug at all).

This is a pretty straightforward stage and lasts anywhere from months to years. It really depends on the drug being studied. I would never really expect a mainstream drug to get through this stage in under 6 months. The only conditions in which that would be logically feasible are either: 

1. COVID (solely because of the politicization of the process) or 

2. drugs treating conditions with extremely high mortality (because people won’t survive more than 6 months).

Lots of companies like to start releasing press releases close to FDA review of phase 2 results. Always be wary of those results. If my breast cancer drug was successful in 600 people and failed in 300, then while the numbers look good, the data may not be there. There is a lot that goes into statistical analysis and it isn’t quite as simple as more people did well than did poorly. 

It’s also important to realize that side effect profile is really important. Let’s say the aforementioned breast cancer agent ends up prolonging life in 80% of the study participants that received the drug. However, there’s also this nasty little side effect of developing a pulmonary embolism in 15-20% of people. That’s not insignificant and it is up to the FDA to decide whether or not the risk outweighs the benefit. Sometimes the FDA will order companies to redo this phase if the data are inconclusive. With cancer agents, this is common because the drugs are so toxic to so many parts of the body, so it really is about risk/benefit analysis.

The important thing to look at in this phase when comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group is what is called the p-value. For those of you who took stats, you should know what this is. For those that didn’t, just know that in healthcare, results with a p-value >0.05 are considered insignificant. It’s also important to note that clinical and statistical significance are also key things to remember. Sometimes the benefit of the drug is so minimal that the side effect profile outweighs the benefits and the FDA will prevent the drug from moving forward. It’s also important to remember that if this is a drug entering a market where there are competitors, the FDA will look and see if this drug provides enough benefit over existing drugs before making a decision. 

One more nuance that pharmaceutical companies love to do is change the primary target. In the statistics world, that’s a pretty big no-no. If my initial proposal was that the breast cancer agent would prolong the life of my patients, and then suddenly I start talking about how it actually increases their pain-free time, this is a huge red flag. You can deduce that they likely didn’t meet their primary target and pivoted to something else they could meet. In any study you can find specific characteristic that makes you look good. 

>Investor takeaway: this is the first phase that companies can really release “meaningful” information. Because of this, many companies try to raise funds at this time to capitalize on the hype, be wary of the words used in their press releases and marketing. 

**Phase 3**: Phase 3 is basically a repeat of phase 2, but bigger. It’s used to determine real efficacy of a drug. In raw numbers, we are looking at about 300-3,000 participants and up to 4 years of data. Phase 3 looks at the exact same things as phase 2: efficacy and side effects observed among a treated group (and sometimes compared to a control group).

Statistical significance, that is, the thing that tells you whether the drug worked, is based heavily upon power. If you want to increase power, you can increase the sample size. In phase 3, the FDA is giving the drug a chance to sink or swim. They are once again looking to make sure you don’t discover any new, obscure side effects and to ensure that the phase 2 results were not a statistical anomaly/the drug really does work.

Beyond sample size, the biggest difference between phases 2 and 3 is that we are observing a longer period of time for adverse events. Note the maximum time differences: up to 2 years for phase 2, and up to 4 years for phase 3. There are side effects that don’t manifest within the first 2 years. 
A very simple example is, actually cancer agents that cause cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis after years of use. These are things that may have been masked in the phase 2 study because the duration. 

The other thing is that we may discover rarer, more deadly side effects in this phase. Let’s say in phase 2, we found that 2 of our 1,000 participants developed brain cancer. The phase 2 data may show that this was statistically insignificant and cannot be attributed to the drug (remember, sample size is very important). Maybe the phase 3 study will suddenly show that another 8 people developed brain cancer and it was due to the drug. 

>Investor takeaway: many drugs fail here, and not because they don’t work. They fail because they aren’t significantly better than what is available or the benefit is not enough to outweigh the risks. FDA approval isn’t simply contingent upon a drug working, there are many, many factors that come into play. 

**Phase 4**: this is the big phase, thousands of participants, possibly multiple hospitals around the country/world. This phase further increases the power of the data and shows that the drug really, really does work and is actually safe. Getting to phase 4 is actually a pretty big deal.

At this point, the company will apply for FDA approval including all of the information they have gathered at this point. In this stage, we are considering not only efficacy and safety, but also simplicity of use, and drug abuse potential. Drug abuse potential is a pretty hot topic right now because, well, opioid epidemic. Many opioids in the last few years have not received FDA approval solely because they are too easily abused. This entire application process takes 6-10 months for the FDA to review all the evidence and decide what happens.

It is not uncommon for the FDA to request more data before approving a drug or further review. Many times they will request the company conduct a new study of x to determine y. This is normal but can seriously impede the approval timeline of a drug. This is where you have to remember opportunity cost. After approval it goes to market, yay!

>Investor takeaway: you may think once the drug receives FDA approval that you are out of the woods in terms of your investment. You would be wrong. 

**Making it to market**: When a drug finally hits market, there are two major things for investors to consider. Let’s start with the scary one, removal from the market. Remember how many times I’ve mentioned power, and sample size above? That becomes super relevant here. Depending on the drug, when it finally reaches market we may have many-fold more “participants” with which we can study the side effects of the drug. 

Sometimes drugs are pulled from the market because certain side effects emerge that flew under the radar during clinical trial phases. Sometimes the FDA sticks a black box warning on the drug (which really makes doctors stop prescribing it unless they have to). In either care, share prices tend to drop. They will plummet, though, if the FDA removes it from market.

**Market earnings**: The last “opportunity” for investors in the approval process is the sales data after the first quarter of marketing. This is where the company shows their revenue from the sale of the drug. If you have medical knowledge, you can really thrive here. If you don’t, you are likely to get screwed because you probably won’t understand the nuances in what drives physicians to prescribe drugs and avoid others. 

Just because a drug works super well doesn’t mean it will ever be used. Examples of that are ACRX’s new sufentanil agents. Those will likely see poor sales data because from a clinical perspective, even though they are approved, and work, they will almost never be used. You would  not know that without understanding the specifics of post-operative pain management.

And finally, a disclaimer. Anything I said here, I can be totally wrong. Sufentanil could become the most popular agent on the market for reasons I don’t understand or couldn’t fathom. Maybe ACRX will have an insanely good marketing team. I am simply talking about making the best decision based on the available knowledge. Stock prices are fickle beasts and they don’t always respond the way we expect.

**A message to those who tend to hold on to their bags to gamble on FDA approval:**

> Yes, this really is gambling. Look at the statistics of how often drugs make it past each stage. You lost 40% on ATOS, you know what would be worse? Somehow their drug fails and now you have lost 80%. You see a drug running before FDA decision deadline, don’t buy it. No one knows how the FDA is going to respond and you are just as likely to lose your money than you are to make it.

> Honestly, you are more likely to lose money because there are three outcomes, and two cause you to lose money, one of which will potentially bankrupt your position. The FDA could either approve the drug (yay!), outright reject the drug (oof), or ask for more information. That last one is kind of misleading because it may not mean the drug has failed, but it definitely will destroy the hype built up and tank the share price. The extra information requested could take forever to get and you would, once again, have to consider opportunity cost.

If there is anything else you think I should have discussed, just let me know and I will try to add it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question About Trailing Stop Loss Orders I am working on learning about stocks and trading and I have been reading a lot lately on stop limit/loss and trailing stop limit/loss. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer too. Let's says I buy 100 shares of Stock A and then set a "sell all shares" trailing stop loss on it at 20%. Then after some time it's doing alright, but I hear some news about the company that makes me think big moves are coming so I want to buy another 100 shares to capitalize on the price spike. If I purchase the second batch of 100 shares, will they fall under the "Sell all shares" trailing stop loss order that was set initially on the first 100 shares tax lot, or would I have to set a second trailing stop loss order for the new tax lot?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This sub has been dipping in quality for a while, but with double the numbers I think the mods need to start doing some major reforms. Ok, as just a causual observer who has been subbed to a bunch of different stock relating subs including securityanalysis, investing, stocks, stockmarket, and yes even wallstreetbets. I always had a wide range of posts on my feed with different quality posts. Before the whole GME ordeal I actually found most of the subs to be at least 30 percent quality posts on an average day, with stocks being more close to around 60 percent. These are based on the top threads I would look at when browsing the subreddit. 

Nowadays stocks seems to be going through a "DD renassaince" where people are posting DD about any company that catches their eye. My problem is a lot of them aren't actually due diligence and mostly akin to affiliate marketing. You can tell who is just trying to pump up their stock  so they can get a bunch of new investors before they can move on to their next play. 

I have a few suggestions for the mods but of course they aren't perfect, I'm just brainstorming. 

1. Several flairs will require character limits. We don't need three paragraph DD's, or constant speculation without discussion. I think any flair relating to a company or industry should have a minimum of 10,000 characters. Mods can play around with the character limits but if someone can't even make up that much which in alll honestly is a 5 min read on an average blog page, then they aren't looking for a discussion. They are creating an ad. 
2. There should be a new rule that every DD, must include at least ONE negative thing about the company in which they are talking about, whether it be debt, competition etc. Perfect unicorn companies are once in a blue moon. EVERY company has faults, the point is how they deal with those faults and overcome them. 
3. There should be weekly megathreads to contain discussion of whatever stock of the week there is. 

These of course are all just suggestions, and I invite anyone to offer their own suggestions as I want to see this sub grow properly and not turn into a wallstreetbets or pumpandump._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RESN - G5 play. My First DD! I got involved with trading recently and have loved seeing all the amazing DD some of you put together. So I figured it's time I give back. I haven't seen $RESN talked about recently so I decided to do a bit of a dive on it. (I apologize beforehand for lack of meme-speak and rockets)

&nbsp;

Resonant Inc, a late-stage development company, designs and develops filters for radio frequency (RF) and front-ends used in the mobile device, automotive, medical, Internet-of-things, and related industries in the United States and internationally. It uses Infinite Synthesized Networks technology, a software platform to configure and connect resonators that are building blocks of RF filters.

&nbsp;

Why is this important? Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G. Their technology allows to filter out lower frequencies that can overlap with 5G frequencies, critical as the RF spectrum becomes more and more congested. This technology has the potential to be in every 5G device.

&nbsp;

In the beginning of 2020, they signed a strategic investment and a licensing agreement to design 5G RF filters with their XBAR® technology, with Murata Manufacturing, THE biggest RF Filter and Duplexer manufacturer in the world. (Source: Navian, 2019)


&nbsp;

In late December 2020, the company released a letter to shareholders indicating that they surpassed a shipment milestone of 50Million RF Filters, among other encouraging news. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150894/0/en/Resonant-Issues-Shareholder-Letter-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html)

&nbsp;

Yesterday, February 9th 2021, they provided prelim FY2020 results, showing revenues increased 330% YoY to a Record $3.2 Million. Also reported that as of December 31, 2020, Resonant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.0 million, which included $11.0 million of net proceeds from sales of equity under the Company’s previously announced at-the-market (ATM) program. And as far as I can tell, no debt. [source link](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/09/2172260/0/en/Resonant-Provides-Preliminary-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-Revenues-Increase-Over-330-to-a-Record-3-2-Million.html)

&nbsp;

Here's where it becomes interesting.. Resonant has reached a milestone with Murata Manufacturing allowing them to move to the next phase of building a commercial platform & high-volume manufacturing of XBAR-based RF filters for 5G. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/05/2103536/0/en/Murata-Manufacturing-Co-Ltd-the-World-s-Leading-RF-Module-and-Filter-Provider-and-Resonant-Inc-Confirm-Target-Performance-Packaging-and-Initial-Reliability-for-First-Mobile-XBAR-De.html)

&nbsp;

Institutional investors have also been steadily increasing their stake: 

* AWM Investment Co., Inc.	7.70%
* Longboard Capital Advisors LLC	6.97%
* BlackRock Fund Advisors	4.77%
* Select Equity Group LP	4.66%
* Park City Capital LLC	3.69%
* The Vanguard Group, Inc.	3.18%

43.44% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors, based on some early January numbers. Probably higher now.

&nbsp;

Short % of Float (Jan. 29, 2021) 10.01%

Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jan. 29, 2021) 9.33%

It is reasonable to assume that not too many are betting against this company.

&nbsp;

$RESN has been popping up on my twitter feed via some of the traders and investors I follow such as: [@LuoshengPeng](https://twitter.com/LuoshengPeng) and [@kkernttb](https://twitter.com/kkernttb) among others.

&nbsp;

So what we see so far is that their sales are growing, they're exceeding their projections, meeting contractual agreements while working with an industry giant. The best part is, they have opted for an intellectual property licensing business model, in the manner of Qualcomm, ARM and others.

&nbsp;

$RESN seems to still fly under the radar but has a good runaway to go for 2021.

&nbsp;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this one! And how did I do on my first DD. 

&nbsp;

POSITION: I'm long. 2500 @ $7.10 as of today, Feb10 2021.

**UPDATE** SOME MORE INFO ON RF FILTERS...The proliferation of 4G LTE networks, the deployment of new 5G networks, and the pervasive nature of Wi-Fi are driving a dramatic increase in the number of RF bands that smartphones and other mobile devices must support. And with the coming of IoT, those bands will be more congested than ever! Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls. RF filters are nothing new, and have been a part of mobile devices since their creation with 1G phones and those old wireless handsets we had at home before the advent of cellular tech!

 &nbsp;

What makes this unique is that 5G needs to be even more isolated from other bands to ensure signal reliability and strength. $RESN is at the forefront of this tech for 5G.

&nbsp;

Here's a link explaining the congestion in RF bands, a bit physcis-y.. https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/semiconductors/article/21137042/resonant-resonators-fuel-highperformance-rf-filters-for-5g

I have a corsair power supply, AIO liquid cooler, keyboard, and desk pad, and I've bought their low profile memory kits twice in the past. I believe in their products, trying to learn more about their business. 

A few days ago, Corsair was being talked about a moderate amount across investing subs, regarding possibly being a good play depending on the earnings report. 

I have 12 shares currently, but Corsair has been mostly trading sideways for the last few months. With mostly positive news and stocks dipping somewhat, is this a good time to get in/go more in on Corsair?

XPO smashed expectations, as analysts had projected EPS of 68 cents on $4.2 billion in sales.

“The investments we made in our people and technology in 2020 helped us to generate the highest revenue of any quarter in our history,” said CEO Bradley Jacobs in the company’s news release. “The industry’s biggest tailwinds are at our back in 2021—e-commerce fulfillment and returns, supply chain outsourcing and fast-growing customer demand for our digital capabilities.”

Looking ahead, XPO expects to generate about $1.8 billion in 2021 Ebitda, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Wall Street is projecting about $1.7 billion. What’s more, the company projects about $5.50 in EPS, which is far higher than the $3.91 analysts are currently projecting.

I've had my eye on BHF for a while now. The stock has appeared to be undervalued for quite some time. Could this new announcement of yet another stock repurchase program for a total of $1.3B of their common stock be another reason to buy now? It seems as though they may also feel their stock is undervalued.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ OPEN: Prospects and Thoughts?  

Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) went public last October and had been quite a hit. I bought the stock on Monday (Feb.8) and it soared more than 27% by today (Feb.10). I sold some shares and am thinking if I should hold the rest for long-term profit of just cash in the rewards.

\-The company operates as an iBuyer of real estate properties, mostly residential properties. They allow property sellers to put in information of their properties and make online offers instantaneously, claiming that total expenditure of selling via Opendoor would be much cheaper than hiring a real estate agent. After purchase they will renovate the property and sell them online. They also offer home loans and refinancing of mortgages.

\-They currently offer services in 23 cities in USA, mostly in West Coast, Midwest, Central Atlantic and Southern states. The company claims it has serviced more than 80,000 home owners. The company sold more than 18,000 properties in 2019.

\-Revenue for 2019 reached $4.74 billion. Despite the pandemic, revenue in first three quarters of 2020 reached $2.3 billion and operating loss diminished by more than 34% to $119 million.

\- Catherine Wood's ARKW bought a lot of the stocks. As of Feb.3 the ETF holds approximately 4.24 million shares of OPEN (1.63% of ARKW portfolio).

My personal pros:

\-Online exchange of real estate properties only take up 1% of total property deals in USA. It could be the next big thing in online purchase like online car selling and buying.

\-The company pledges to expand its mortgage business and with the booming housing market due to low interest rates it could add to the company's operating incoming.

\-The company is yet to move into housing market in New England and Northeastern states and when they do it would be a lot more growth space for their business.

My personal cons:

\-The management has stated that the company might not turn profit until 2023. (That being said, it seems many popular stocks nowadays are attractive for their future prospects, not current profits)

\-The recent hype of the stock could be attributed to recent buyings of ARKW.

\-The company's current business mode depends heavily on huge cash flows to buy properties for cheap and provide mortgages. Sudden circumstance changes (failure of securing cash input, Fed raises interest rates, resurgence of pandemic, luekwarm economic recovery e.t.c.) could take a heavy toll on the company's business.

All ideas are welcome!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What should I do to maintain my gains? Hi everyone! I’ve been following this sub for a few months and have found it very helpful, so I was hoping to get some advice from experienced investors such as yourselves. 

I’ve been investing since December 2018. I started with five stocks (TD, FTS.CA, CNR, NVDA, & ACB), and for my first year, I didn’t add much money or even look very often. This proved to work out in some cases (e.g., NVDA) and screwed me over in others (e.g., ACB), but I considered it a learning opportunity and invested in a few more stocks at the start of last year. I didn’t spend much time in the market until Fall 2020, where at the start of November, I began my tuition and really started to love investing and longer term swing trading (2 months average).

Long story short, across a TFSA, a cash account, and a crypto account, I’ve invested about $64,000 and as of today, it’s grown to about $115,000, nearly doubling my money. While I can attribute some of the gains to research and due diligence, I really feel like almost everything I invest in has been going up a crazy amount lately. I’m nervous for the inevitable pullback and wondering how others are approaching this? I don’t typically keep much money in cash, and worry that if I did, the market will keep booming without me. Then again, I don’t want to lose all my gains because this money will help my fiancé and I buy a house and support our future family sometime next year. How are you all approaching the market right now and should I keep doing what I’m doing? It’s been working well for me so far!

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys say when your family or friends ask you to invest for them? I've had two people recently ask me to invest for them.  I've been doing pretty well with my own account, but I'm not sure how I feel about risking other people's money.

The first is my father, who I'm considering taking him up on, mainly because I'm his sole inheritor anyway -- but it would be a significantly larger amount of money than I'm used to dealing with, which makes me nervous.

This sincerely is a bit distressing because I put a fair bit of money some time ago (hundreds of dollars each into diff stocks, not thousands or tens of thousands like some people on here so easily seem to toss).

These are companies I've believed in, and have felt they will do great long-term, but now?  Some of them are now meme stonks, and they're getting to be pumped too much by everyone trying to make a quick buck.

Yeah, I should be happy for the gains, but do you realize what that does to a company to skyrocket and then come crashing back down?  Especially once the media starts talking about X or Y company being the next big Reddit stock?  It makes regular investors grow leary of the stock afterwards, and the businesses are then lumped in with the /wsb stonks that were hyped.

What should have been steady month-over-month climbs for some of these have now made me feel like I have to watch my holdings like a hawk for when everyone starts dumping so I don't just not only lose out on earnings, but end up with shares that are valued much less than what I paid for them.

Im new here so if this is not the place to ask this just delete the post please_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ON - ON Semiconductor Analysis # $ON - ON Semiconductor

First time posting DD - please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of the post.

### TL; DR - Why I'm Long $ON.

ON Semiconductor Corporation, manufactures and sells semiconductor components for various electronic devices worldwide (see below for a detailed breakdown of products / services).

- The **semiconductor industry** as a whole is expected to **increase by 8.4%** in 2021^(1). Personally, I think it will continue throughout 2021 and possibly into H1 2022 as macroeconomic should continue to improve and pent-up demand is released.

- ON has historically struggled and maintained **lower revenue growth and profit margins** over FY19, FY20 Q1 and Q2 both historically and especially when compared with its peers.

- FY20 Q3 and Q4 have shown a significant turnaround which have allowed it to exceed average quarterly revenue growth for FY19. This is in part due to macroeconomic recovery.

- They have recently brought on a **new CEO and CFO** to turnaround their business. The new CEO has **experience growing both revenues and margins** at Cypress Semiconductors. He was also a moving force behind the **merger** of Infineon Technologies and Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the organisation.

- A primary reason for the **lower margins** are the use of several global semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) which increase the overall cost of goods. The organisation is in the process of **building a new fab** (in Fishkill, NY) and releasing multiple fabs (e.g., Belgium, Japan). The use of Fishkill should significantly **improve margins** and bring it more in-line with competitors.

- A key source of revenue (**~30%**^(2)) has been the **automotive sector**. As vehicle electrification (conversion of non-electrical vehicle systems) and the focus on the development of electric cars increases over the next few years the amount of $ON products within vehicles is likely to increase. As a result, **revenue will increase** from this sector. This area is likely to also be higher margin.

- Additionally, $ON products find their ways into **vehicle charging** and **battery technology** which is also a growing area. Global drive for **power efficiency** will also increase in the face of the "Green Deal" and increasing global drive for **CO2 reduction**.

- The business currently has the **free cash flow** and **shareholder backing** necessary to re-focus their business away from low-margin and revenue declining products to focus on **high growth and high-margin** areas. While this does depend on management execution at the present time, I see no reason why given historical track records of the new leadership they would be unable to deliver on this promise.

- Current P/E remains high (~69^(nice)x) however **forward P/E at 23x** is a lot more attractive particularly with the view presented above.

Please do have a read of the Bear / Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced view and an idea of drawbacks / considerations.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 08/02/2021

1. Share Price: $39.81

2. Market Cap: 15.787 B

3. Next Earnings: 31-03-2021

4. Analyst Day - 05-08-2021 (This is a day where they will talk about overall strategy and financial targets).

# Detailed Analysis

### Organisation Summary

Manufactures and sells semiconductor components focussed on 3 main segments:

1. Power Solutions Group – Target markets are industrial, and power focussed.

2.  Advanced Solutions Group – Target markets are industrial including automotive (this is a growing market segment and includes electric vehicles^(3) and autonomous capability^(4)), consumer including personal electronics e.g. laptops etc. (this is a slowly growing and relatively stable market segment barring unforeseen macroeconomic issues^(5)), computing (cloud power management - growing particularly due to remote working requirements and increasing cloud focus from organisations^(6)) and industrial communications (IoT – growing area^(7)), medical (medical imaging – stable, clinical point of care e.g. quick diagnosis / testing – most likely growing, patient monitoring – growing, portable medical devices – growing^(8)) and aerospace / defence (stable, commercial aerospace most likely shrinking to a degree^(9), space related chips – possibly growing longer term?). Also provides custom design / fabrication (probably small market segment / overall revenue contributor).

3. Intelligent Sensing Group - Image sensors, proximity sensors etc. across similar markets to ASG. Again, expected to grow both from an industry perspective but also from a product perspective^(1).

### Bull Considerations

- The Fishkill fab at maximum capacity is expected to allow for the generation of **2 B in revenues**. The current timeframes expectations are that this capacity can be reached by **2023**.

- The ramping of Fishkill is a few months ahead of schedule and the organisation is actively seeking to **sell two fabs** in Belgium and Japan which should make available some cash.

- Continued growth expected in higher margin product areas incl. automotive, communications (e.g., 5g), medical etc. (See Organisation Summary for details).

- ON may prove to be a **viable merger / acquisition target** - M&A isn't an area I'm too sure on how to research so this may be way off base.

- Weiss Asset Management **increased holdings** by 4.3% (as a portion of portfolio) around the last half year / year to 5.2% could signal bullish institutional sentiment.

- Relatively high level of cash flow will mean they are likely to be able to maintain the interest payments of ~140 / year. Additionally, their assets more than cover their liabilities.

- Good growth in both EPS ($0.38 and $0.21 in Q3 and Q4 FY20 respectively - Q3 was higher due to income tax return) and free cash flow (101.8 and 283.9 for Q3 and Q4 FY20) on a quarterly basis over the last year.

### Bear Considerations

- For FY19 the largest 5 customers across each business unit (PSG, ASG, ISG) comprise 41%, 35% and 48% of revenues respectively. This means a loss in even one of the largest customers would have material downwards impact on revenue. 10 of the largest customers represent 27% of total group revenue.

- Increases in prices of raw materials e.g., gold, copper, silicon etc. would cause significant negative impact to profit margins.

- While not fully cyclical in nature they are expecting fluctuations in results from quarter to quarter over the next year. While I don't expect the dips to be significant especially when compared with '20Q1 and '20Q2, or FY19 this could still put a damper on my price expectations.

- Any significant dips in revenues and free cash flows would impact ability to repay loans, this could impact ability to repay loans.

### Neutral Considerations

- Moody’s gives $ON a credit rating of **Ba1** which is sub-prime i.e., reasonable credit risk / risk of default but speculative in nature so could have upside^(9).

- The new Head of Intelligent Sensing Group has significant experience in automotive products (incl. at Nvidia) which could indicate additional product focus on the autonomous driving side.

- No insiders have been purchased shares since 2016 and have been selling since then. However, one thing to note is that organisation executives / leadership are typically long-standing employees, and this is presumably not atypical behaviour.

- If the demand drops again then ON face underutilisation charges for their facilities and machinery which would reduce gross margin.

- Failure to execute on streamlining business would result in large capital expenditures on new / re-focussed product areas without the required return.

- Weak track record on M&A activity with acquisitions to date being sub-optimal and not really synergising with current offerings or opening significant new markets. If this continues would negatively affect price and waste free cash flow.

By April APHA and TLRY are going to merge, meaning every APHA share will be converted into 0.83 TLRY share.

So it's my understanding that as long as APHA/TLRY < 0.83, it's worth buying APHA since it's basically discounted TLRY share.

Today APHA/TLRY = 0.45

I read here that the closer we're going to be to the merger, the closer this number is naturally going to be to 0.83

So my question is :

For this number to get close to 0.83, will APHA rise, or TLRY dip, or a bit of both?

Thank you and sorry if it's a basic question i'm trying to understand_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
