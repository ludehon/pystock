 EU strikes deal with CureVac for up to 405 mln COVID vaccine doses Good news for mankind: CureVac's vaccine is also effective against Covid-19 and the EU signs a deal with them.

"The European Commission will authorise a deal with German biotech firm CureVac on Tuesday to secure up to 405 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said.

"I am happy to announce a new agreement. Tomorrow will authorise a new contract to secure another COVID-19 vaccine for Europeans," she said, adding that the contract with the German firm follows EU funding to the company to develop its vaccine.

The Commission president also said she hoped to finalise a deal soon with Moderna for its COVID-19 vaccine.

The deal with CureVac follows supply agreements the Commission has reached with AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and Pfizer for the supply of their potential vaccines."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Costco announces a special dividend of 10$ a share https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN27W2XX

I have a question I've been wanting to ask for a while now. So I'm using the free version of YF app to track my portfolio. What I've noticed is that once you've liquidated your positions fully in a stock by putting the minus sign next to the lots, you are left with two choices: 

1. You keep the stock in your portfolio where it stores your data, your returns which is reflected in the total portfolio balance; doing this however will mean I now have 10-12 stocks on my app that I have to scroll through on my screen when I've already closed out all the lots. 
2. You simply delete all the stocks entirely from the portfolio list; this provides a more cleaner look as you no longer have old stocks to scroll through, however deleting it now erases all the gains and cumulative returns you've made on your total stock balance

Is this supposed to be how YF designed the app, and is this a feature that I'd need to pay for in the upgraded version? I don't have plans to upgrade the app or anything, but I am just wondering if anyone else is facing the same dilemma as me, or am I just being totally OCD about it. 

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What's your investment philosophy? It took me a couple of years to get there, but I think I've finally landed on good investment philosophy/strategy.

I've realised that all of my biggest investing losses have been when I didn't know much about the company I was buying and the market it was in. Or when I tried to time the market and buy/sell at certain times. My biggest wins have come from buying companies that I understand really well and holding them for longer.

I work at a large enterprise tech company, so for me this means focusing on other enterprise software companies. I often get exposure to these companies because I use their products at work. This helps me to get a far better understanding of their likelihood of future success. I also plan to hold each investment I make for a minimum of 5 years. (Ideally 10+ years).

There's nothing novel about this approach. Buffet calls it focusing on your "circle of competence". But sometimes, you need to come to the same conclusion through your own direct experience.

Option B. A REIT ETF that's down about 50% from all time high last year, the holdings are all USA. I can buy several hundreds of shares here. They pay a monthly dividend that I would reinvest in the ETF. Risky play short term, but long term I think they'll bounce back once the USA opens up.

Alibaba has a secondary listing (BABAF), which I invested in back then because it's much cheaper than its primary listing (BABA). At the time of this post, the BABAF is $32.84 per stock while BABA is $258.31 per stock.

I thought I made a smart decision until I talked with my friend and he showed me the news and the recent events in China regarding Jack Ma, Alibaba Group, and his newer company (Ant) being halted by the president.

Currently, it doesn't look so good. I've been reading books regarding history and governance, when an authoritarian doesn't like a businessman; it usually doesn't end well for the company. (Side note: NIO which I've invested in and a lot of people are positively betting on is backed by the Chinese government and it's doing well, this shows a pattern and possibly how to predict a stock of a company based on its relationship with its authoritarian government).

Magna isn’t waiting around for the electrified world to come to the company. As one of the few Tier-1 suppliers with full-vehicle manufacturing capabilities, the Ontario, Canada-based “mobility technology” company already is involved in production of three OEM electric vehicles (EVs) and hopes to apply that skillset for additional manufacturers, perhaps in North America. Magna recently announced that Fisker will use its EV platform to underpin the upcoming Ocean SUV (top).

Magna was heavily involved in the engineering of the Fisker Ocean and also will manufacture the all-new EV, with production slated to begin at a Magna-Steyr facility in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2022. Beyond the contract-manufacturing arrangement with Fisker, Magna also will purchase shares representing 6% of Fisker’s equity. The Ocean is one of four EVs for which Magna has a production connection, including the Jaguar I-Pace, Sony’s Vision-S and the ArcFox Alpha-T.

&#x200B;

With Magna already a contract manufacturer in two of the world’s three largest automotive markets, North America is plainly in its sights. “We have a clear strategy to not only expand our production in China, \[but\] to also offer our service in North America,” Stein explained. “It all depends on the awarding situation. As soon as we have a firm contract, we would be able to offer that in North America.” 

[https://www.sae.org/news/2020/11/magna-charging-ahead-on-contract-ev-production](https://www.sae.org/news/2020/11/magna-charging-ahead-on-contract-ev-production)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just bought me some PTON I was pretty bearish on this stock until very recently but I've come to the conclusion that I just didn't fully understand/appreciate the opportunity here.

I ran it through my scorecard and it came out with the highest score of any stock I've analyzed.  The growth speaks for itself; the question for me has always been whether the growth can continue.  My earlier thinking was, "No way, they're going to run out of people willing to spend thousands on exercise equipment."  But I completely misunderstood where this company is headed, and didn't give enough credit to the brand value.  Here's why I decided to invest at this point in time:

1) While the equipment is expensive now, it will come down in price over time.  As the business scales and grows, they will be able to offer the equipment at cheaper prices to bring in new business.

2) I think this company is working on a model like Apple's, where it starts off as a hardware company but over time the hardware will just serve as the mechanism to bring people into the Peloton ecosystem.  The real money-maker is the digital subscription and content service.

3) The bikes/treadmills might be just the starting point for the company.  The next stage will be to see if they can figure out a way to grow into other types of equipment to capture other forms of exercise.  For example, if they can figure out a way to sell some strength training equipment so people can do weights in the Peloton environment, that would be huge.

4) I completely underestimated the brand value and the hook of the community.  I'm not a customer myself, but every person I've heard from who is absolutely loves it.  Some of their top instructors have hundreds of thousands of social media followers.  They just signed a multi-year partnership with Beyonce.  So while other companies will try to compete, I just don't see them being successful in dethroning the king.

5) But what about vaccines and getting back to normal?  I don't think it matters at all.  Will some people return to the gym and use their Peloton less often?  Maybe.  But as long as they keep their digital subscription, it doesn't matter.  People who invested the money in the equipment aren't suddenly going to quit using it because COVID is over.  I think the true value of PTON is that it creates a gym environment in the comfort and convenience of your own home.

6) Based on future growth the stock was actually fairly valued at its high of $140 recently but the selloff down to $100 makes the stock very undervalued._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who's next in line for a vaccine breakthrough? After the news coming out today with Moderna, currently looking over this:

Under the wash sale rule you cannot claim loss if you sell at a lost and buy the same stock within 30 days. My scenario is a bit different. I expect a market pullback and I want to lock my gains without tax but also don't want to miss the bull wave.

I have a Roth IRA account and a regular broker account.  


Roth IRA with Vanguard Technology(VGT) with 2k Gains so far.

Broker account just cash.  


Can I sell from Roth to lock the gain then buy the same amount back in broker account?

My idea is:  
If it is a bull market then my gains will be in broker account and I have to pay some taxes.

If it is really a bear pullback then my broker account will have a loss and after 30 days I can sell the loss in broker account and claim the loss in taxes. (If I didn't make this move and it hit this scenario then previously I wouldn't be able to claim tax loss because my stocks were in ROTH.

Hi all, I'm new to this subreddit so apologies if this isn't the right spot.

After having no experience in stocks whatsoever, 1 year ago I got into playing with cheap stocks (\~$5 per share, so not technically pennystocks?), with the strategy of selling them when they hit $10, buying 2-$5 shares, and repeating the process. I've been able to do this a couple times, but its a slow process for sure. I always hear that stocks always go up in the long term, so is this a viable strategy to make a little money for a passive stock trader like myself?

On a side note, I also bought 1 share of UBER when it come out, and I was planning on selling it when it reaches $100/share, similar to my strategy with the small shares I have. It has been such a slow crawl upwards so far (almost $50 now) should I keep it and watch where it goes, or are there similar priced stocks with greater potential for growth?

In late September, the company said the FDA imposed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 2/3 study as well its Cellectra 2000 delivery device.

"The FDA's authorization to proceed is based on its review of INOVIO's non-clinical data, device information and interim Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data as well as its design and plans for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 segments of the planned clinical trial," the company said.

Just 8 weeks ago, Germany had a swine fever affect almost its entire hog population causing Tyson Foods to spike 5 percent. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/10/german-farmers-face-possible-pig-culls-as-african-swine-fever-discovered

About 16 months ago, China´s hog population was decimated from another swine fever.

It is going to take China 3 to 4 years to get their hog herd just back to where they were. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-meat-consumption/chinas-pork-consumption-falls-as-african-swine-fever-spreads-idUSKCN1SN0HG

Additionally, Each person in China eats 74 pounds of pork a year. It is very Hard to change a habit like that.

About 12 months ago, Tyson has started actually making plant-based meat products, and hybrid protein products that are appealing to consumers who want to eat less meat. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-unveils-plant-based-nuggets-in-move-into-meat-alternatives.html

This is right on the back of Beyond Meat reporting an absolutely horrendous earnings report.  Beyond Meat BYND, reported a loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents a share, vs. net income of $4.1 million, or 6 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue improved just 3% to $94.4 million, from $92 million a year ago.  Beyond Meat has a revenue that is less that 1 percent of Tyson´s revenue.

Tyson Foods is a BEHEMOTH and it is time to start saying how can they improve as a company rather than just telling people to stop eating meat! Tyson even produces all of the chicken and most of the beef products that supplies McDonald´s corporation!
Maybe farmers can start giving their cattle a different diet(Wendy´s looked into this and proved that emissions from cows can be cut drastically just on the type of feed the cattle are given). Maybe Tyson can start to build smaller and more spread out slaughtering houses so that several thousand people do not have to come together and work at one location. Maybe we should stop condemning this company that employs 145,000 extremely hard-working Americans.

Because Brazil, with their enormous animal agriculture, is simply going to fill the vacuum if companies like Tyson shrink. Before you start thinking of Tyson as the enemy, just keep in mind that Brazil actively burnt down their rainforest last year in order to clear land to have more ranches and to further expand the amount of heads of cattle they can produce. Remember that hashtag that trended on Twitter #savetherainforest for about 2 weeks and then we all forgot about it and went back to browsing the internet. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/why-brazilian-farmers-are-burning-the-rainforest--and-why-its-difficult-for-bolsonaro-to-stop-them/2019/09/05/3be5fb92-ca72-11e9-9615-8f1a32962e04_story.html

More than 30,000 fires burned in the rainforest in August alone, a nine-year high, according to the space research institute.

The fires have prompted activists to call for boycotts of Brazilian goods. Fifteen fashion labels, including Vans, Kipling and Timberland, have said they will not import Brazilian leather. Finland has called for a ban on Brazilian beef imports to the European Union.

One last final thought - Yes, raising beef and chicken is very water intensive, but so is many other industries and crops. It requires 600 gallons of water to produce one pound of cheese.

Also this week we saw the largest ever global equity inflow as you can see in this Bank of American chart as there were over 40 billion dollars being pushed in equities. [CHART](https://ibb.co/18g7xrJ)

All sectors finished in the green on Friday with real estate, energy and industrial leading the way with all 3 sectors having more than 50% of companies up over 2%, even tech kept up the pace after leading us through this recovery with over 37% of companies being up more than 2% on the day.

We also saw small-cap and value plays outperform again as people are betting that the economy will have a broader breadth of recovery after the vaccine will be available. [CHART](https://ibb.co/jTMx5ry)

The VIX also finished the week very strong as it continued to decline to it’s lowest level, ending the week at the 23 level. [CHART](https://ibb.co/j4057B8)

As you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/dW01vyR) and the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/G2Fvk7c) almost all companies were in the green on Friday with a few exceptions like Nvidia, NetFlix and Alibaba, as they were punished a little after the huge run they in the last 9 months while Alibaba continues to struggle with the Chinese government.

The COVID-19 numbers are dangerously going up as you can see, with daily cases going parabolic, indeed with a bigger number of tests being taken but there is still a huge rise in positivity rate, and as you can see this is the 3rd hump of the pandemic in terms of numbers of hospitalized people. The one positive thing for the moment is that deaths haven’t gone up as much due to the better treatment but this number does usually trail the others so we will have to see what happens in the next weeks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/wdSTt4v)

Here you can see better that weekly test are up almost 10% while weekly cases have gone up 4times that much almost at a 40% growth rate while the hospitalized and deaths have not increased as much as the cases yet. [CHART](https://ibb.co/QpzPbs8)

This weeks interesting earnings [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/K5bMM4B) in my opinion will come from Walmart and Home Depot before the open on Tuesday as I expect both of them to dazzle in the earnings reports, while Walmart is expected to have an EPS of 1$ and 19 cents I expect them to be around 1,5$ at least like last quarter while Home depot is expected to have an EPS of just over 3$ I expect that to be at least 30cents to half a $ better then expected also as the companies look to continue the amazing earnings season that is mostly ending this week as we saw an overwhelming number of companies beating the estimates by quite a gap.

This will be followed after the close with the Concept company NIO which has been going up amazingly in the last weeks as it has touched even 54$ but has since seen a pullback of almost 10$, so be careful when trading this, it may be a bumpy ride as the company is still losing money and seeking to increase manufacturing and sales, as I don’t see them having to much of a success in Europe even if the manage to launch they’re cars there, this because people will have a stigma for the company as being Chinese, and not offering great quality. Despite the recent Chinese movements some good news came in on Sunday as China has formed the largest free trade block that includes fifteen Asia-Pacific Economies with big names like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others being included [NEWS](https://ibb.co/XbcqV80). This group will account for 30% of the global economy and population. This will probably bold well for NIO as it has tanked after Citron released a statement that they are taking profits in NIO [NEWS](https://ibb.co/SQBbW6s).

Moving on Wednesday we will also get some other retailers reports with Target and Lowe’s releasing reports also before the open. I believe this two will be impacted by what Walmart and Home Depot announce, if they have great results expect them the stocks to see a double move on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, one of the biggest gainer of the stay at home moves, nVidia, will report after the close as I expect them do have great earnings again as they will continue to benefit a lot from the stay-at-home economy as October videogame sales were up 14% expect this also be translated into Nvidia’s earnings as this was the month before the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony were released. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/kK3WWj4)

So I really like all 3 of Home Depot, Walmart and Nvidia and if you want to make a gamble you can also make a small investment in Nio, as there are no other big catalysts at the moment earnings may impact the stocks and we can see a re-test of highs for all of them.

One other company that I will keep my eye on is Disney as they beat the expectations for earnings, revenue and subscriber for the streaming business, I will watch what updates the investors meeting in December will provide us, as I really like the company and the stock very much, if they want to keep this going and become a rival for NetFlix they do have to invest much more money in content, as they will have to keep providing new content that generates growth for Disney+. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/QNCc3D3)

Some other news from the last days are that Qualcomm has received an exemption to sell chips to Huawei, which is not was expected that they would be allowed to sell 5G chips, but still is good news for the company as it provides another buyer for its products. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZVp8gTw)

While DraftKings soared on Friday after they announced better than expected results and guidance for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qy9vmyB)

This came alongside the filing of documents for the hugely anticipated of DoorDash the leader in food delivery with a 50% market share. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/sWZDTpB)

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Brexit and UK stocks So it seems Citi this morning recommended investing in UK stocks because most of them are the beaten down pandemic stocks that stand to gain a huge amount if things ever manage to open up again. Examples of stocks I've seen going up are Lloyds, easyJet, Vodafone and so on. Although it's very tempting, does anyone not think that they could also stand to drop even further if the Brexit negotiations fall apart? I just can't see any scenario that will be a win for the UK in these negotiations. I could see sterling taking a sharp drop if the negotiations collapse. Even if an agreement is made, there is just no way that the UK won't have to make enormous compromises. What's everyone's thoughts on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ is it to late to get on the pltr train?  

so im 19-2 (when i said the number it got removed but in israel it is allowed) right now and i really wanted to get in on pltr since iv done quite a bit of research on it and i got some money saved up.

the problem is that because im under 18 the procces of buying stocks at list in israel is rediculisly slow for me i not only have to do it only threw the bank and my commision is like 2% but i have to do it at the bank its self as in not online which is so stupid but thats the law apperantly. and with covid getting an appointment there is making it even worse point being i could never but at dips and sell at highs and make profit i can only go there give a order to but at the next opening and hope its a decent price and hold.

due to this i missed out on the last 2 days of pltr which went up in total like 20-15% and am now wondering if you guys still think its a good buy if i get in at say 17 hopefully?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Monthly Income Stocks for a $1 Million Investment? In a hypothetical scenario, you have $1 million that you’re looking to park in certain stocks that offer at least 3% dividends and also pay out monthly. What are they?

I was hoping I could find something amazing like 6% dividends but I’m not sure._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it worth re-buying a stock? Hi there! I'm new to stock investments, and I have a question that has been bothering me for quite some time now.

We'll use, for the sake of argument, an investment in the S&P 500 Index from the year 2000.

So, How will the profit/loss over the years vary between those different scenarios?

1) Re-buying daily

2) Re-buying monthly

3) Re-buying Yearly

4) Holding for the past 20 years

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place or the wrong question but I have looked online and I can’t understand why this is not the case. 
I have a rudimentary understanding of stocks but I can’t grasp why when a company announces a vaccine that *may* completely more or less bring life back to “normal” in the next few years hasn’t had its stock speculation/value triple overnight? 

I checked online and the share price is pretty much identical to what it was in early February? 

I always assumed 

Pharma company creates/licenses vaccine > world governments order mass quantities of vaccine > Pharma company makes a fortune > pays huge dividends > stock price increases massively 

Can someone please explain what I’m not understanding?

What would stop the Chinese government from stealing the technological innovations of private EV companies operating in China and using them to bolster their own state-run enterprises?

They know something that the average reddit investor doesn't? I would say always follow the money..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taking initial investment out and letting the rest ride long term. It’s been a good, yet pretty wild ride for the markets. I’ve had a decent amount of winners and I have this habit of taking my initial investment out and letting the rest ride(especially on growth companies) I like to think of it like free stock. I go and find other good companies and repeat. I of course have a bunch of solid companies growth/value that i don’t touch and let the compound interest grow and capital gains. I’m wondering if you wizards think I’m shooting myself in the foot or not._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Has anyone actually looked into BABA financials? They dont make any sense to me I see some very strange things like net income being higher than operating income many quarters.  

Also seeing very inconsistent profit margins. Q2 was 150bn rev with 50bn net income.   That is way too high to be believable for ecommerce even with cloud.  Q3 they pull in the same revenue but net income now just 28bn.

Does anyone understand all the abnormalities?  I love the idea of BABA because of growth in Asia, and it has recently dipped due to ANT problems. But these weird as hell financials are giving me pause._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD vs. NVIDIA? Thoughts on the current state of the two companies?

I have messed around with penny stocks in the past and know a thing or two but not an expert and probably have lost money in the last couple years rather than make any real profit.

Does anybody know where one could find S1 filing summaries? Kind of like Coles notes version._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling stock and taxes Hi guys got a question for you, let’s say for example you buy a stock that is $1 and you put 10K into it. So you now own 10,000 stocks.

2 months later the stock is $2. You don’t want to risk losing money, so you decide to sell 5,000 stock at $2 each. That means you get $10k back, and you still have 5,000 stocks. 

I understand some people will sell because then at that point, they get their initial investment back and anything after that will just be pure profits and you can’t lose. 

My question is, because you sold your stock and you got 10k back. Do you need to pay taxes on that 10k? Or do you not because it wasn’t profit? So would the best idea be to sell off enough to get your 10k plus cover taxes ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is Reddit's opinion on investing in Blackrock Investments (BLK)? Blackrock commands over $7.1 Trillion, most of which is through ETFs, of which Blackrock has a 36% global marketshare. Considering that ETFs make up about half of all investments, that means Blackrock manages about 15-19% of the global market. This company is not going away anytime soon.

They are a unique combination of massive market power and limited name-recognition. Billions of people know Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN) as common household utilities, yet in comparison, nobody knows about Blackrock. 

Blackrock is the largest individual investment-managing company. It is more-commonly referred to by their iShare ETFs. 

I have been using ishares index ETFs for almost a decade. For almost half of my life, I have been investing through blackrock, and those investments have grown faster than any of my other investment ventures.

I finally pulled the trigger on buying BLK when it dropped to it's March/early April low.

Seeing now that Biden is just about to seal a victory, my thoughts go to the older workers nearing retirement concerned for their investments. They will most likely want to DCA 1-3 times per quarter into ETFs to lessen the risk of potential executive orders on the market. 

I believe that ETFs will become the go-to investment for the next 4-8 years, thus making Blackrock a great investment.

I'm new to this so apologies in advance if I ask any silly questions!

I'm 21 and I've recently begun gaining an interest in the stock market/investing etc. 

But I dont have enough knowledge to be able to make informed decisions and to find these upcoming companies that will make me money in the future. 

 I want to know the best way to learn about the stock market. 

Any recommendations on learning courses I could take or shows to watch? I want to be able to understand what I need to look for when planning on buying a stock, what makes money, what won't etc.

Any advice would be great! I'm currently thinking of a few companies. Nio being one.

I’ve been “investing” since 5 months ago and finally maturing towards long term positions.

APR is 5% annually, your first $1k are interest free._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Walmart to sell Japanese supermarket Seiyu to KKR, Rakuten (Reuters) - U.S retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N) sold most of its stake in Japan's Seiyu to investment firm KKR (KKR.N) and e-commerce company Rakuten (4755.T) in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at 172.5 billion yen ($1.65 billion), the companies said.

Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6% stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008.

But the company, like other foreign entrants lured by the high spending power of Japanese consumers but frustrated by cut-price competition, has struggled to make money in Japan.

KKR will buy 65% of Seiyu and Rakuten will acquire a 20% stake while Walmart will retain 15%, the companies said in a joint statement.

Japanese media reported two years ago that Walmart was seeking a buyer for Seiyu, and a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen.

Sources said at the time that it failed to find a buyer. Walmart said last year, amid speculation it was seeking to exit Japan, that it aimed to list Seiyu but retain a majority stake in the business.
