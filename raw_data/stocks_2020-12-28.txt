Not sure if people on this sub have been following this unicorn of a stock. But it started as a reverse merger called KCAC, (these always always IPO at 10 dollar/share), and since the ticker switched from KCAC to QS the stock is up over 300% in about a months time.

Some background on quantumscape - this is a company attempting to create a working solid state battery, and it is back by Bill Gates. Currently, they have a functioning prototype of a single monocell. They do have a partnership with VW.

Projected revenues aren't to BEGIN until 2024, and their current market cap is 40 BILLION!

I speculate the stocks recent run up has been based around an unfounded rumor of connection to Apple's Icar, however the chemistry Apple outlined for their cars battery isn't even solid state.

Listen I understand how disruptive/huge this technology will one day be, and I know the market is forward-looking, I know they have patents etc. but this stock seems like an example of these factors gone way too far, it's essentially a science experiment valued at 40 BILLION!

I understand we are in a meme market, where silly financial metrics like revenues and P/E ratios don't matter (P/E currently infinity for QS since there's no E), but it's only a matter of time for this stock to come crashing down.

It has been finding support around $115/share for about a week now, and quite frankly I am baffled by this. People on this sub are constantly mentioning how overinflated the valuations of EVs are, and meme stocks like PLTR, but QS is taking this to a dangerous extreme, in my opinion.

Previously I [posted this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kkg0bn/unique_problem_of_too_much_money/) and nobody liked it, but I don't care.  Bring it on.  I'll clarify on some other points.

My reason for doing this is to solicit all ideas, conventional and unconventional.  TIA to those of you that actually contribute something meaningful. 

So after reviewing my realized Gain/Loss report for 2020, I discovered that every one of my stock sales has been a gain, and 99% of my unrealized gains/losses are all gains.

Gross wages have been \~$50k, and my stock market \*realized\* gains have been \~$40k, for a total of $90k.  I also have $100k in \*unrealized\* gains waiting in the shadows.  I plan on holding off until 2021 and selling some of those right away.  I have never made this much before.

Is there anything I can do to temporarily 'lose' money in the markets thru December to reduce my 2020 taxes? Perhaps buy a solid company that will temporarily drop in share price, only to bounce back within the 1st few months of the new year?  Yes, I know most of you don't like this idea.  I'm thinking of doubling down on a solid company.  Using a bit of margin and buying 2x what I normally would.  If the stock goes down, sell 50% and take the loss in 2020.  Hold onto the remaining 50% for a while then hopefully book a gain in 2021.  If not, just exit the position and use that as a loss to off-set some of my 2021 gains.  And if it doesn't go down by 12/31, then just take the gain on the 1st trading day of the new year.  I see this as the blend of a strategy and a **gamble** with positives either way it goes.  If the stock goes down I temporarily lose a bit in value, but off-set my gains.  Ride it out and also make a profit in 2021.  And if the stock goes up, it just makes me more  money.  Had I done this strategy when it popped into my head right before Christmas,  I'd be up $5-6k as of today.

And if you have a different strategy, I'm certainly open to hearing it.

And are there any other negative tax consequences to making $90k+ this year?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shopify Alright guys I could truly use your help.

Do you guys see this company here for the long term, 5-10 years? I like what they have started, and they seem like they could compete with amazon and start doing crazy e-commerce stuff like fulfillment centers._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Strategy for 2021 Starting to think about how I plan to approach investing in 2021 and a few things are swirling around in my head at this point:

1) Risk of an early January pullback.  Why?  Investors made more money in the markets in 2020 than ever before, which means huge tax bills, which is an incentive to wait until January to take profits in order to push those tax bills back a full year.  This means we might get a chance to buy some stocks at discounts in the New Year.

2) This year was highly, highly unusual and won't be repeated in 2021.  I think there is an increased likelihood we see a real rotation out of the high multiple growth stocks that led 2020 and into undervalued stocks.  The market leaders of 2020 will not necessarily be the leaders of 2021.  This is especially true of the FOMO/meme stocks.

3) Notwithstanding (2), there were certain themes that emerged strongly in 2020 that will carry through because they are dominant themes for the near future.  I think the top 3 are e-commerce, fintech, and genomics.  Some of the leaders in these areas have done very well in 2020 and might pull back or base early in 2021 so the valuations become more reasonable.  This is where we might get some good opportunities if (1) does in fact occur.

4) 2021 will be the year the world gets vaccinated for COVID, so it should be the year of the reopening stocks.  Travel/tourism, restaurants, brick-and-mortar retail, casinos have all come off their bottoms but have a long way to go.  As the world gets vaccinated and starts to get back to normal, people will be desperate to enjoy these things again.  Given (2), this is where we could find many of the market leaders in 2021.

5) Longer term risk to the markets when the Fed starts closing the spigot.  The markets will continue to climb as long as the Fed keeps propping it up, which is why we've had the longest bull market in history and are seeing crazy valuations.  So despite the risk of a pullback early in January, there is no reason the market won't continue up from there - until Fed liquidity starts to dry up.  That's when we could see the start of a real bear market.

I noticed beyond meat has been a fairly popular investment considering the plant based/green trends. They have some pretty good partnerships. However, it seems that they have increasingly negative operating cash flow year over year. I see this as a way to look at the health of a business and its ability to generate $. So why are so many investors (institutional and retail) able to overlook that? Since it is getting owrse and worse, it seems to be signs of a sinking ship. The company seems to be losing more and more $ in operating cash flow each year and also borrowing more and more money.

\- PERI raised its Q4 revenue to $100M-$105M from $81M-$91M vs. $86.14M consensus

\- Stellar Q3 earnings. Beats on revenue and EPS. Revenue growth of 27% YoY

\- Company is well-positioned to reap the benefits of ads increase in the CTV space

\- Consistently has been decreasing debts every quarter

\- Partnership with Microsoft has definitely provided brand recognition

\- The digital advertising and CTV space has been red hot in 2020 and has more than enough reasons to attract more $$$$$ in 2021

\- As of 12/28, the stock has taken a massive dip so it's trading at an unbelievable discounted price and options are very cheap too!

1. EV/Revenue = 1.3x (vs 59x for TTD or 19x for MGNI)
2. Price/Sales = 0.55x (vs 61x for TTD or 14x for MGNI)

BOOM!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Digital Turbine (APPS) posed to grow with AAPL? Would it be a good long term holding, and is it overvalued? Hello, I have a good amount of my portfolio (20 percent) in Apple. Recently, a stock called Digital turbine caught my eye. It was in a collection of stocks I had small investments in, but when it skyrocketed from 40 to 60 (now about 56) after news of Apple profits (correct me if I'm wrong), It got my attention, and I think I am ready to buy it. Before I do so, I have a few questions on what you think about this stock:

As AAPL grows, do you think APPS will grow?

Would APPS be a good long term holding?

And does APPS seem overvalued to you.

I finally got my balance cleared on Webull and have began actively looking into industries and businesses poised to thrive once the pandemic dies down.

I am really appreciating this community and learning so much. From recommendations here, I started to listen to Razors Edge podcast and now reading about Mark Spiegel’s views on Tesla. I found a puzzling phrase in this Institutional Investor article- it references Tesla’s shares going above $1000 in August. But the stock price wasn’t at that level ever- so are shares different than stock?

Here is the sentence:
“ The company’s shares sped to a new high on August 17 — rising 11 percent from the record set the previous day of trading — to close at about $1,836 each” from this article: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mzy62nf393lw/The-Longest-Unprofitable-Short-I-ve-Ever-Seen

So what gives? Is a stock different than a share?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quick Stock Market News for Today | SP500 / NASDAQ / DOW JONES / ALIBABA [BABA] | [12-28] **Do you want to know what happened in the stock market on Thursday? Let’s talk quickly about that and what were the latest news over the weekend**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! I’ll try to keep this as short as possible this time so that everyone can enjoy the holiday period as much as possible. So, let’s start with the recap of Thursday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing in the green with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/25nr29H) leading the way up .35%, but still lost ground for the week, down .14%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zRsdNyJ) gaining .26% and finishing .38% up for the week and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/dr0WyrS) rising by .23% to close the short week of trading with a small gain of .1%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/pbKmzP9) dropping by more than 7% again to bring the volatility index down to the previous levels before the 30% [spike](https://ibb.co/hMjhQhH) we saw on Monday, as it has [dropped](https://ibb.co/kgPCkvn) almost 7 points after that spike.

We had a pretty much even market with just over 100 new highs as most [companies](https://ibb.co/SJCrVzX) traded below average volume on the short day, with 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/YbSSMt3) of the SP closing in the green, with Real Estate, Utilities & Technology leading the way while the Energy sector was the only one which lost ground Thursday, as Large-Cap growth companies were the [biggest](https://ibb.co/hYTsTLG) gainers, with small-caps finally underperforming after a great run in the past weeks.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/8MKCB9h) from Thursday, with most big tech Names gaining slightly, except Alibaba which plunged after China started the probe into the monopolistic practices of the company, while for the [week](https://ibb.co/f2NzK9d) we can see a pretty mixed stock market with big gains being made in the tech sector mostly, while big healthcare names, utilities and most of the Energy companies lost ground this week.

We also got a couple of economic numbers in the past few days, as holiday retail [sales](https://ibb.co/bB4XtGm) are estimated to be up 3% with online sales up almost 50% between the 11th of October and the 24th of December as e-commerce accounted for almost 20% of overall retail sales, up more than 6% since last year with big winners like Amazon, Wayfair an Etsy as well as big gains in the home improvement and home furniture sectors.

The other big number we received is more worrying, as investors have made a new high in margin debt, with over $700B in [margin](https://ibb.co/qYxdPtw) through November, I personally don’t use margin even when buying leveraged products to avoid too much volatility in my portfolio.

And one last report that we got from Reuters, is that they expect [China](https://ibb.co/LtKVg0T) to overtake the US and become the biggest economy by the end of the decade.

We only have a fed survey coming in [today](https://ibb.co/170H4tD), and this [week](https://ibb.co/Gsjqvf8) will be most of the same, with only some sprinkled numbers in the middle of the week, and not anything interesting to be reported as earnings go, before a closed day on New Year’s Day.

And in some other stock market news, we saw Alibaba increasing the stock [buyback](https://ibb.co/SXgfNW8) plan to $10B but this wasn’t enough to stop the bleeding for the company as this news came alongside the demands made by the regulators for [Ant](https://ibb.co/55zL5VK) Group to fix problems in some segments of their business before they can move on with the company going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES US](https://ibb.co/1XWqjyW) / [FUTURES INTL](https://ibb.co/D5TJ4Cs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, after President Trump finally signed the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/55v9p8L) deal last night, finally ending this long messy situation.

This write up will be done with the assumption you have read the previous post here:

Quick Example

Say John buys XYZ 100 1/15/21 Call (Buy-to-Open) for 1.00 and this contract has the following values:

Delta: 0.50 Gamma: 0.05 Theta: -0.02 Vega: 0.01

and the Current price of XYZ stock is $95.00.

This tells a lot but we will start with how Delta and Gamma work together:

(1) The Delta says that for every $1 move either up or down in price, will either decrease or increase the value of the option contract by 0.50 (e.g. $50). You will notice most option contracts are bought and measured for statistical purposes in the ranges of 0-0.20, .21-.40, .41-.60, .61-80, and .81-1.00.

(2) Then because Gamma is 0.05, for every change in Delta relative to a $1 movement in the underlying asset, The value of the option contract will increase by an additional 0.05 ($5) for every additional $1dollar change in the underlying assets price which would there create a correlated change in delta which is measured by gamma. So if the option contract for XYZ is 1.00 when the price of the underlying asset is $95 and then price moves up $1 dollar then the value of the contract becomes 1.50. (1.00 + 0.50) THEN, if the price moves an additional $1, Then the equation becomes, (1.50 + 0.50 + 0.05) = 2.05.

We add Delta and Gamma together whenever we have additional 1$ movements or quantifiably similar changes in delta.

(3) Theta, which is the amount of daily time decay that decreases the value of your options contract. So here we know that even if delta and gamma increase, With Theta being -0.02 we can expect to lose 0.02 every day we hold this contract. INCLUDING WEEKENDS. So now the Equation becomes 2.05 (current value of delta + gamma after a $2 movement) – 0.02 = 2.03.

(4) Vega tells us that if Implied Volatility has a 1% change, then Vega will correlate the price increase or decrease related to the premium paid to buy/sell an option contract. If Vega is 0.01 then we add that to the value of the option contract. With 2.03 (Delta + Gamma – Theta) + 0.01 ($1) = 2.04.

We do not use RHO in this calculation.

Please note that these are not Static numbers and they will change drastically in relation to volume.

You will notice Greek Combinations that have very high Delta and Gamma and Vega translates to an option most likely having a Higher Implied volatility because of how much of a range the option can move in and out of the money from delta and gamma while understanding from Vega that there is also a lot of dynamic price movement to either side. You will find these combinations in ETF’s like SLV, GOLD, XLK, things like that. Because they have high In-the-money probabilities and because their price doesn’t move much, GAMMA is very high which in turn means that smaller changes in delta will add to your contract value quicker.

The most important thing here is understanding the formula and making sure there is liquidity (Volume and open interest) in your contract position.  


I did want to touch on straddles and covered calls which many believe is a better way to trade options in terms of risk vs. reward.  


Straddles  
When an Investor is not sure which direction the market will move but has a strong opinion that there will be dynamic movement, a strategy that might be employed is the purchase of a straddle. This is the combining of a put and a call on the same stock with the same exercise price and expiration date. If the stock moves up, a profit is made on the call; if down, a profit is made on the put. Those who buy a straddle will profit from volatility while those who sell a straddle will profit if the market is stable because the options will expire unexercised.  


Writing Calls   


A Neutral or Bearish investor can write (sell) a call and collect the premium. An investor who believes a stock's price will stay the same or decline can write a call to:  
(1) Generate income from the option premium  
(2) partially protect (hedge) a long stock position by offsetting any loss on the sale of the stock by the premium amount  
(3) If the stock price increases, the call may be exercised. In addition to the premium received when the option was sold, the writer will be paid the strike price for the stock.  
If the option writer is the owns the stock on which the call is being written, is it known as a covered call and the risk is limited because no matter how high the stock price rises (meaning the call will certainly be exercised) , the writer merely uses the stock already owned (which has been deposited with the broker-dealer) to make delivery. However, if the writer does not own the stock, the option is uncovered (usually referred to as "naked" in the industry). That's when the risk is unlimited, because the writer must pay the going market price (and there is theoretically no limit as to how high a stock's price can go) to acquire the stock needed to fulfill the obligation to deliver. That is why Naked Call writing is the most risky option strategy.

I’ve been trying to get together a list of stocks for a long term portfolio. As I look at them now only a few seem reasonable to contribute to at today’s price.

This same idea is what put me off on some of the popular ETFs as they seem overvalued even if they are incredible stock picks.

I have also heard the idea of slow contributions are better than large ones to mitigate risk.

PS here is the list of what I’m trying to get started on this monthly contribution plan.

I’ve had a decent Microsoft holding in my portfolio (roughly 10%) and am wondering what’s going on with the stock?

Thank you for any advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA will be fine (IMO) BUT heres some Chinese light... After speaking with a Chinese contact I found this info bare with the translation...  Bare with this as you read it this is a translation 

"Alibaba's empire will not collapse for a while. First of all, in the field of mobile payment and e-commerce, Alibaba is still the top company. If a company achieves the top position in a field, it will involve monopoly more or less.The news also showed that if it was true that "for the better development of the industry", some money would be fined and handed over to subsidize the society (although this money is exaggerating for most people, it is still relatively small for Ali). This time, the vulgar point is to catch and beat, just to educate.Maybe it's a good chance to speculate."

"The fact that our country is filing antitrust cases is just the beginning, and there will be more to come.Alibaba's U.S. stock market fell below $600 billion and its high fell by 30%. It can be said that it collapsed directly, which shows the power of the second investigation. Therefore, Jack Ma's Christmas Eve was not a safe day.
There is no Era of Jack Ma, only the era of Jack Ma.The early Internet companies, under the slogan of innovation, ran around and even hit some red lights, and the state has been lenient in its regulation.In order to innovate, as long as you don't do bad things and don't go out of line, the country is tolerant and encourages growth. That's why alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Tencent and so on have developed.
But today, they have developed into such a large enterprise, and it is time to nurture society and foster technological innovation. Where is the foundation of the Internet economy?It must be built on the basis of serving the real economy, the livelihood of the people and the national development strategy.However, people are not satisfied with the snake and swallow the elephant, so they play the big data to kill two or choose the way to exploit the common people.
No matter how high you fly, you can't forget your roots.Leaving the country's support is nothing, talk about tycoons, talk about the rich ah.So regulatory action is to prevent these Internet companies from having too much of a monopoly.But not to abolish them altogether.So the People's Daily commented that "the Internet industry has never been, and should not be, a lawless place for antitrust."One flower does not make a spring.An invisible hand has always maintained social justice, so the era of barbaric growth, cutting leeks, pulling wool for violence is over" 


"As is known to all, the main business of Ant Group is Alipay, which was originally established to change the payment method at that time and promote the completion of online transactions.With the determination of Alipay's position in the field of mobile payment, it successively launched the functions of Huabei and Borrowed Bai, and started the credit payment and loan business. With these two businesses, Alipay also conquered some territory in the mobile payment market and became the dominant player in the field of mobile payment.
To give Alipay a broader future, Ma decided to take Ant Group public in order to soak up a lot of money.It is not wrong for an enterprise to go public on a certain scale. However, under the guise of technology and finance, Ant Group chose to go public on the KEChuang Board, with an obvious intention to get rid of the supervision of China's financial system
After reading all of this its relatively clear to me China is most afraid of losing control over its electronic transfers.  I also belive baba is hurting institutional banks. 

Once the ant group in kechuang board listing is successful, there is no corresponding regulatory system, once the ant group management appeared a little problem, it may cause big shareholders' money and run, the risk of people regarded as leeks harvest, with the ants', will cause a huge holes in its capital, social unrest, finally need countries pay for him" 



It appears China was most concerned with losing the big bank consumer transactions... 


Be easy on me as I literally copied and pasted my conversation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Neo Lithium Corp : NLC.V:TSX Hello Everyone, 

This is my first post here, and I'm going to be explaining some DD on Neo Lithium Corp. You can read for yourself some of the information I have [here](https://www.neolithium.ca/index.php). **All of the $ values in this post will be in CAD - Canadian Dollars**

**Fundamentals:** 

NLC is a lithium/lithium carbonate mining company headquartered in Toronto, and operating in Argentina. They are traded on the TSX, under the ticker symbol **NLC.V.** They are planning to operate in the Lithium Triangle, a region in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia **LOADED** with Lithium. Approximately 27% of the worlds Lithium supply is mined out from this region, and 12% of which is located in Argentina, where Neo Lithium Corp is operating. The area in which they operate is 100% owned by Neo Lithium Corp, which lowers external risks from competitors operating in the area. More info on the competitors will be included below in the risks section.

Now, into the good stuff. Currently, NLC is priced at $1.56 / share (@close December 27th) with a market capitalization of \~$187M. Yes, I know, the market cap is quite small compared to other big industrial companies, however this company is fresh and is showing great upside potential. Recently, they secured an \~$8.6M deal with CATL, a massive Chinese lithium battery manufacturer, where 10.2M shares were sold to CATL. This is good news because it means that this company is getting noticed and people are buying in. NLC has a strong net cash position, approximately $35M, with little to no debt. The no-debt thing was mentioned in their investor presentation, but take it with a grain of salt. I believe they have little debt, but it would be foolish to assume that they are completely debt-free, however, they are in a great position cash-wise. Approximately 9% of outstanding shares are owned by company insiders, 40% belonging to institutional ownership, and the remaining 51% being publicly owned. The volume on average is \~290k which is quite low, but is steadily increasing as the days go by. I expect to see a massive volume increase by the spring.

Speaking of the spring, the last peace to this puzzle is **to obtain the construction permit.** Once this permit is granted, the company will be fully operational and start generating revenue. As this happens, news will come out and with that, attract investors to this company. There is no definitive date where this permit will be granted, however I expect it to happen before Q3 of 2021. When this permit is granted, and revenue starts being generated, I expect the stock to rise by AT LEAST $3 by Q4 2021. The best thing about this is that the price currently is dirt cheap. Yes, I know, stocks that are priced this low are quite volatile and risky, however, it is up to you and your personal risk tolerance to decide if this play is right for you. I've included a risk section to detail every risk that could be potentially threatening to this company. Continuing on, you will be able to absolutely load up with shares on this company and by the time summer of 2021 comes around, you should be able to realize a large gain. Please note that this play will take anywhere from a few months to a year to actually make you some money, however if they are successful in operations then holding longer will prove more profitable.

**MY POSITION (CURRENTLY) : 122 shares @ $1.50 / share.** I would like to say that while I would love to buy more shares, I'm a semi-broke college student with not a lot of money to invest, so I'm doing the best I can. I do plan on buying more shares with any money received over the holidays. Please refrain from making fun of my positions, lol. 

&#x200B;

**TA:** 

Right off the bat I'm going to admit I'm no saint at Technical Analysis. I have watched quite a bit of videos, and gained a minimal amount of knowledge in TA. However, the rule of thumb stands, which is **to conduct your own TA**. This is simply DD.  I'm going to include my share of TA so that you guys can get an idea of how the stock is performing, however it's definitely best if anyone interested conducts further TA.

[This](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=NLC.V) link is the link to the [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) graph of NLC. It includes the RSI, MA (50/200), and the MACD chart. Starting with the RSI, this stock fluctuates in between 50 and 70, and ATM is at 61.15. This is a decent rating as it indicates the security is neither underbought/overbought. It fluctuates periodically over 70, only to drop immediately after. It typically drops a few cents when it peaks above 70, but typically recovers once it hits \~50.

Moving on to the candlestick chart w/ moving averages. As seen in many other securities, the 50 day Moving Average acts as a support line, and you can see for yourself how it bounces after it comes close/touches the support line. Both moving averages are showing bullish symbols, so that is always good. 

Looking at the MACD indicator, as I'm writing this the EMA's are bottoming out after a bearish 2 weeks. I expect to see a nice, bullish 1-2 weeks coming. The indicator shows lots of people selling, but the number of which dropping each week, which to me is bullish. The candlesticks are currently showing a bullish uptrend above the support line but looking at how the stock has performed in the last 6 months I think it will continue to bounce, which is inline with what the MACD indicator is showing. 

**TA TL;DR:** Technical Analysis of this security is showing a bullish trend in the coming weeks.

**Risks:** 

**Risk #1: Construction Permit Not Granted.**

The first main risk with this play is the construction permit getting blocked. This would be absolutely detrimental to the company as the future of NLC is entirely dependent on this permit being granted. There are 2 reasons that I believe would be the cause of the permit being denied

* **COVID-19**
   * Obviously, COVID-19 is a serious risk to tons of businesses this year. If COVID-19 continues it's rampage on the world we might see the local government in Argentina cancelling any concurrent operations. This could mean a delay in getting the construction permit, and if granted, a pause in the construction process. We also have to take into account that COVID-19 procedures in Toronto may cause delays in decision making/administrative related-decisions. Ultimately, most of the risk from COVID-19 is focused in Argentina.
* **Argentinian government changes their mind.**
   * I really do not see this happening, but I'm just including it juuuuust in case. Other companies already operate in this area and have been for quite a while, so the odds of this happening are quite slim. If it does happen, its not good news for NLC.

**Risk #2 - Competition**

This is a risk that occurs in any industry. Competition is inevitable, and some may see it as a bad thing but I see an increase in competition as a sign of money to be made. Most of the worlds lithium is produced by "the big three": **Albermarle Corp, FMC Corp, and SQM (**Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile)

* **Albermarle Corp** mines lithium in CHILE
* **FMC Corp** mines lithium in ARGENTINA, however the lithium division of the company is a separate entity 
* **SQM** mines lithium in CHILE

Since NLC is going to be operating in Argentina, the main competitor is FMC Corp. FMC Corp is a big company, however they operate in an area hundreds of miles away from where NLC is going to be mining. Also mentioned above, NLC owns 100% of the massive area where they operate, so it's almost safe to say that FMC Corp will not be a huge risk in terms of generating profit

**Risk #3 - Switch from Lithium batteries to some other variant**

This risk is close to impossible from happening, however there's a sliver of a chance that some big, blockbuster switch from lithium batteries to some other compound occurs, where most lithium mining companies would be heavily impacted. I highly, highly doubt this is going to happen in the next 2-3 years, so its a very small risk.

Well, this is the end of my DD. Please feel free to comment your thoughts, ask questions, or call something out I may have missed/overlooked. I'm no JPM analyst, just a 20 year old trying to make some money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A couple of questions about investing young I made a post a few days ago and got some great advice here and learned a lot, so thank you all for contributing to helping me grow my knowledge of investing

Now, I have decided to go heavy into VTI. Right now I'm 20 years old and I have to start out slow but I'm thinking of one initial investment of about 1k into VTI and from then on out 100 per month until I can invest more per month.

A couple of questions before I start though and again, I'm very new to this so please feel free to explain it to me like I'm 5 years old.

1. This one may be a little hard to answer because no one can predict the future. How risky is it getting into investing with how things look right now? I'm not talking about if next year looks bright for the stock market. I'm talking about 20, 30, 40 years down the road. Will the stock market still be a thing? Is it likely that things will crumble to the point of investing for that far into the future with index funds and ETFs becoming pointless?

2. Heres where you can belittle me and call me ignorant. With VTI a quick google search shows that that fund pays dividends. I believe it was 2.2% or something like that. Is that 2.2 percent on every stock I own? So say VTI was $100 per stock and I had $1000 worth, would that be $2.20  annually or $22 annually (or whenever they pay out dividends)  or do I just not understand dividends at all and its 2%  of something else entirely?

3. I understand the concept of "do not panic sell" because selling locks in your losses. Is there ever a time when you would consider ditching that rule? Say maybe you're too close to retirement or you're at a point where you feel you've got too much to lose?

4. Why do people insist on betting on smaller companies and individual stocks, when on average index funds and ETFs have greater chances of success in the long run, with the added benifits of (correct me if I'm wrong and explain how the opposite could be true please) being almost completely safe and risk free?

5. Even if I'm going long term and with little to invest right now, should I try to pick up individual stocks once in a blue moon with a chance of hitting it big? Maybe just a couple shares? Or stick with only preferred ETFs and index funds

And that's all I can think of right now, again thank you all for the help on my previous post. I got lot of great feedback and didnt get bombed with downvotes in return. I got to hear a lot of good advice from people who have way more knowledge than me and that's what people like me need.

&#x200B;

$DHI: Such a beautiful ascending triangle play. Also a support area which is awesome. Needs to break EMA lines to show real strength, and Stoch showing divergence, and VI is low

&#x200B;

$ENBL: Rebound play, as it has bounced here before. Just needs to break the 50EMA line, and the 200EMA is your support area. Stoch is low, RSI was oversold, and VI is low

&#x200B;

$ERIC: Expensive, but perfect ascending triangle play. Once it breaks EMA lines it is will be massive. Indicators say it has room to drop still, which is fine. Could be a big move

&#x200B;

$GFF: Another beautiful ascending triangle play. At support, but indicators say it may pull back but price action is what is important for this one.

&#x200B;

$KTRA: Great penny stock channel. Once it breaks the 50 and 200EMA lines, it'll go crazy. Showing higher lows as well, RSI fair price. Great setup.

&#x200B;

$LULU: Another beautiful ascending triangle. All Indicators say it is a great deal, and it is holding above the 200EMA. Has room to drop still, but eventually -- this will be big

&#x200B;

$NGD: Simple channel up, and now a 50EMA bounce play. Stoch just reversed, RSI fair, and Vortex says good deal. 

&#x200B;

$NIU: New channel play here, very good value. All indicators say it is a great value play here, and just needs to break EMA lines. 

&#x200B;

$SPT: Resistance now being tested as a support; 50EMA bounce play. May drop to the channel up area, which is fine -- but for now the Stoch says it is gearing up for a move here.

&#x200B;

$TAST: Channel that has higher lows over months now. Hanging above 200EMA which is great, and this channel is very strong. If it dies buy into the triangle channel and then go long.

&#x200B;

$TNX: Fantastic deal here. Ascending Triangle, at support, if this breaks up gonna be fantastic.

&#x200B;

$TRIL: Fantastic deal on a channel play here. Higher lows, and just has to hold above the 50EMA line. Indicators say it is tired, so it may pull back, but it is a great setup.

&#x200B;

$VIR: Great triangle play here, great deal, and has plenty of room to run.

I’ve been in the market since early 2014.  I started with a few stocks, with 10 shares of APPL being my first purchase.  I didn’t know much about investing at the time, but learned to DRIP my dividends thru TDAmeritrade.  This made sense to at the time, especially because it was the only way to buy fractional shares and commissions were still $6.95. 

Given you can buy purchase shares without a commission now, I’m wondering if i should stop dripping and handle purchases myself.  I have about 10-12 dividend paying stocks, such as those listed in the title.  Several are monthly paying as well, including STAG, O, MAIN, and PREF.

To put it in perspective, i earned about $325 in dividends since 10/1/20 to present.  I don’t need the money at the moment.  I like most of my dividend stocks.  So keep DRIPing or allow the dividends to post to my account and other good buys at the time?
