 My Watchlist For 1/21/2021 -- ThinkOrSwim Chart Import Links are Included -- My FAVORITE Picks On First Slide :)! \*\*I use the 180D/4H chart for most setups. I also use the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200EMA lines. but most importantly, price action is key.\*\*

&#x200B;

**MY FAVORITE: EBR, EDU, ENBL, ERIE, GSKY, HAS, SDC, TRIL**

$BYND - We called it and rode it, now it is holding and having that first pull back. Will it break this resistance, not sure -- but watch this for another big push.

 [https://tos.mx/EWp8UfM](https://tos.mx/EWp8UfM)

&#x200B;

$CDXC - Very easy to read channel. We are away from support so it may come back down, but again it has plenty of room to run when it breaks the 200EMA line.

 [https://tos.mx/uttpZkk](https://tos.mx/uttpZkk)

&#x200B;

$CERN - Easy 50EMA bounce play and channel up at support. good play, just kind of over bought for my usual taste.

 [https://tos.mx/QlgtkKt](https://tos.mx/QlgtkKt)

&#x200B;

$CNCE - Could be lower for the best value; but this is a great support and it is showing life. It breaks the 200EMA to come back, so watch for that the next few days.

 [https://tos.mx/ThElzi8](https://tos.mx/ThElzi8)

&#x200B;

$CREE - Easy 50EMA bounce and channel support play. Like a few others, too far away from the norm for me. A bit overbought but indicators still look good. 

 [https://tos.mx/e8EWOPp](https://tos.mx/e8EWOPp)

&#x200B;

$EBR  - Fantastic channel up, making large scale ascending triangle... my favorites. Right at support as well. RSI fair, But Stoch has divergence and Vortex low.

 [https://tos.mx/ghdOTbD](https://tos.mx/ghdOTbD)

&#x200B;

$EDU  - Channel up from heaven, very much like $EYE. Support, 200EMA, and channel support - love it. Indicators all fair at best.

 [https://tos.mx/kWnOhgC](https://tos.mx/kWnOhgC)

&#x200B;

$ENBL - Great support area, and showing higher lows consistently. We may dip to the 200EMA right near it. Possible triangle, I like it. Indicators low, but RSI only fair.

 [https://tos.mx/r0kVSaZ](https://tos.mx/r0kVSaZ)

&#x200B;

$ERIE - Setup like $EDU or $EYE. More in the middle, but this is a great support. Fantastic value. Wait for 200EMA if you're patient. All indicators are low and ready to reverse.

 [https://tos.mx/GWMbgqZ](https://tos.mx/GWMbgqZ)

&#x200B;

$GSKY - Great channel up, previous higher highs so we have room to run. 200EMA and support also there as well. Indicators low, but RSI is only fair.

 [https://tos.mx/S4rymOE](https://tos.mx/S4rymOE)

&#x200B;

$HAS  - Beautiful channel up, right at support and channel support, 200EMA right behind. All indicators look great as well!

 [https://tos.mx/ulooSio](https://tos.mx/ulooSio)

&#x200B;

$IRWD - Possible new channel forming here. We can get in ground floor, super strong support. Just needs to retake the 200EMA line, and show life, but indicators look good.

 [https://tos.mx/EkOpKk9](https://tos.mx/EkOpKk9)

&#x200B;

$JILL - A little crazy, could be lower. But we want to try and catch one of these spikes. Indicators are fair, but if it breaks $4.10 it may have an insane move.

 [https://tos.mx/9Kq5Nrx](https://tos.mx/9Kq5Nrx)

&#x200B;

$MORF - Great channel up, but slow moving. It has a great run on the 200EMA line, and can make some really good moves when given good news. Indicators are fair, so wait for volume.

 [https://tos.mx/0DU0L1O](https://tos.mx/0DU0L1O)

&#x200B;

$SDC  - Fantastic support, channel up, possible triangle. Looking like a great run. All indicators low waiting to reverse.

 [https://tos.mx/e5lD1QF](https://tos.mx/e5lD1QF)

&#x200B;

$TRIL - Very calm and consistent channel up. Support and volume node holding as well. All indicators are low so a reversal will happen eventually. 

 [https://tos.mx/v5SQM9h](https://tos.mx/v5SQM9h)

&#x200B;

$WEN  - We called it, we rode it; and now we have our first pullback. Hopefully it isn't too severe - and we continue climbing. This is the time to buy in.

 [https://tos.mx/1OvS6G0](https://tos.mx/1OvS6G0)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who else is in on Aerovironment? They make unmanned aircrafts (drones) and tacticle missle systems for the government. They have 280 million in cash on hand, low debt and are growing revenues at a pretty good pace. Theres also two major events coming up in the next few months that could push them higher.

1. They teamed up with NASA and are launching a helicopter drone "ingunity" on Mars in February. See details here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Helicopter_Ingenuity. It sounds like if this is successful they could have a lot more work lined up with NASA in the coming years.

2. They are a high likelyhood candidate for Kathys new space ETF (ARKX) which i suspect will have a blockbuster launch. Based on the EV frenzy and influx of new investors I think ARKX is going to be massive. 

They have run up a quite a bit in the last month but I see them ripping higher in the next 1 to 2 years with the added publicity. I dont normally buy options but a June $155 Call felt right so I bought one today. Cheers._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Keeping cash in ROTH IRA? Hi!

I have a Roth with about 10k in it (I am 20 and have been investing since 2019.) 

I currently hold 50% VTSAX, 20% ARKK, and 20% ICLN.  The remaining 10% I have in cash.

Is this wise? I was holding it to watch the market to see if I should invest on any large dips or crashes, but since I can’t take any money out of this account until I’m 60, I’m not sure if that applies to this tax free account. For comparison, I have about 13k in a taxable brokerage in which 40% is cash - this account was started more recently so I am still doing My DD on how  i want to spend this money.

If it helps, I plan to rebalance My Roth 2x a year only if needed and I manage my taxable brokerage a few days a week depending on My schedule and what trades I feel need short term maintenance.

Thank you!

>Unfortunately, PSJ trades poorly and is expensive to hold, making it appropriate only for those with steadfast conviction in PowerShares' quant method.

  
As a newbie, I can't tell what this means. It'd be awesome if you could help me understand the following:  
1. What does "trades poorly" mean? Which metric does this refer to? Because on the same webpage, it also says *"This measurement shows how easy it is to trade a $1 million USD block of PSJ. PSJ is rated a 5 out of 5."*  
2. What does "expensive to hold" mean? Is this about the expense ratio?  


Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock data aggregator and analytics Hi all, I'm writing a program that can basically scour the internet, find interesting stocks (by their increase in popularity), do data analytics to 'predict' the trend of the ticker.

Currently, it scans reddit to find (new)  posts made about a certain ticker, build sentiment of the post, the comments etc. 
It also scans google trends to check Google search trends for the past 24 hours.

Overtime, as more and more data is collected, I can create a dashboard so show and possibly run machine learning algorithm to predict which new ticker will do dell by checking past trends of the data collected. 

I also plan to add news analytics, and link articles directly, do basic company due diligence (financials would be the first start) etc BUT, it's expensive get this data (the server to get the news data costs $20 a month, add another $30 for servers, computation power etc), so would people be interested in a subscription model, nothing too crazy, a few dollars a month to help with the upkeep and of it goes well, hire more devs go enhance the platform.

So I guess my question is, would you pay for this kind of information and what additional features would you like to see._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apps for stock related notifications I’m now more than a year active on the stockmarket but I would like to get updates on my phone from the sectors I am following. For example biotech, spacs related news, it are all different news sites that report the articles. Businesswire is one of them. Are there apps to get notifications when there are mergers or issuance of new shares so that we don’t need to check the different news sites 100 times a day and are for free or at least not 5000$ a year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Future or BABA Title is meant to read: Future of BABA.

So I was quite an enthusiastic retail investor of BABA for some time and was awaiting Ant’s IPO with great anticipation.

Then the CCP pulled the plug and BABA stock plummeted. Xi Jinping wanted to make an example of Jack Ma and make it clear that no-one is above the party. This sort of puts a dent in Ma’s grandiose ambitions and his vision to revolutionise how China’s SME conduct their business.

Now, months later, Ma has resurfaced from his hiatus and I hear people are getting more excited about BABA again.

As for me, I believe in the company, their business model and their potential for enormous growth. BUT... if November’s events told my instincts anything it was that no matter how good a company appears on the outside, if the environment in which it exists isn’t nurturing, these principles are sort of out of the window. 

So please: correct me if I’m wrong! I’d love to regain my confidence and invest in some BABA stock again.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Energy ETF? Hi,

Does such thing as an Energy ETF exist? I'm looking for something that contain a mix of fossils and renewables; as the world moves greener that mix would tilt towards renewables. Maybe oil is ok short term but longer term oil maybe not etc. 

So I'd like to sit back and grow with the world's energy needs.

Vanguard has an energy ETF but seems to be fossils only._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is a quick DD checklist for picking stocks? So I'm traditionally a passive investor in ETFs. I'd like to weigh in more heavily on some sectors and opportunities where I see promise, such as cleantech/EV.

I don't want to make purely emotional decisions, so I'd like at least a quick DD checklist to make sure a company I like has good fundamentals.

Early on I wanted to put it in VOO but after reading around a bit more, I want to put my money into some growth ETFs and  decided on either VOOG or VUG. VOOG is SP500 growth and VUG is US large growth. I can’t tell exactly what the difference is. Which is “safer” or has more gain potential to park my money for the next ten years?

Also, can someone recommend some good mid cap and small cap ETFs? Maybe I should split the money into two/three ETFs, large/mid/small caps. Any advice?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SSRI Investments / Biopharmaceuticals to the zoomies! Hi all.

I'm looking for advice on what psychiatric medicinal companies are likely to get the zoomies and run up high. Paxil, Xanax, et cetera have all been cash cows for decades. There doesn't seem to be much news on further developments, however. I've heard of psilocybin stocks but eh you know how the weed boom went.

Where does one start on psychiatric treatment considering how 2020 quite evidently drove millions of people insane as uhm evidenced by a recent post on r/stocks?

When the market crashed it jumped up to about $125. Anyone who was holding UVXY along with other stocks, could have profited from the crash even if all their other positions lost 30%.

Given that the market is currently calm around all time highs and UVXY is currently around $10 again, does holding some UVXY provide good insurance in case of a panic sell off?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rex More from the Motley fool Does anyone else here hate Rex More from the Motley Fool as much as I do.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Cheers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any good reason not to use margin to buy low risk ETFs a little ahead of when you might anyway purchase them? So, allow me to clarify with a scenario first: let's say we have already 100 invested, we are periodically adding more capital in a more or less stable fashion and we were considering buying other different products with low volatility (say, like SPY) in the 10-20 range using margin.

While I understand black swans can always happen and it is a risk we are willing to take, assuming the margin cost is low (say, like in IBKR), any concrete reason not to try and use margin?

If so, why isn't it more popular? At least based on my own personal impression.

Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up "Do you allow this app to track you across different apps". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) " Could Have A Material Business Impact".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

I was looking at the [GME advanced chart on MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme/charts?mod=mw_quote_advanced) (go to 10D or 5D), and it looked like the volume moved almost perfectly relative to the price. Is there a specific reason for this? I don't know a lot about how a larger amount of trades impact a price, but I would assume that more trades of a stock would cause more volatility, but not necessarily in one direction. On the other hand, the recent [TWTR](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr/charts?mod=mw_quote_advanced) fall (10D range) coincided with a spike in volume, which is the opposite of what happened with GME. I doubt these are coincidences, but I don't know how to explain it myself._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AAPL is planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service to increase podcaster revenue. This could force SPOT’s hand to follow suit Good morning sun, good morning trees, good morning Apple...which is reportedly planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service. 

Right now, podcasts are an adman’s game: Spotify and other top companies in the space, like Amazon and SiriusXM, spent the past few years “swallow[ing] up podcasting production firms in an effort to gain more control of the podcast ad market,” per The Information. 

Think: Stitcher, The Ringer, etc. 

Come back later: It could be bad timing for Spotify, which recently saw shares decline after analysts at Citi downgraded its stock because Spotify hasn’t shown “‘any material benefit’…from its $800 million-plus investment in podcasting content and tech,” per Variety. 

And, in theory, a major subscription service has the potential to yield more money for creators than the ads keeping them afloat now. 

Why it matters: This isn't the first ad-free subscription podcasting service, but Apple's deep pockets give it a better shot at disruption than smaller upstarts (looking at you, Luminary).

Its had a massive run the past month but I believe that it is only getting started. However, I do see a small pullback.

A quick description of the company is this:

"Greenlane Renewables Inc. provides biogas upgrading systems worldwide. The company's systems remove impurities and separate carbon dioxide from biomethane in the raw biogas created from anaerobic decomposition of organic waste at landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and farms and food waste facilities for injection into the natural gas grid or for direct use as vehicle fuel. It offers water wash, pressure swing adsorption, and membrane separation technologies."

The company is currently getting deals from municipalities in Canada, Germany, and some parts of the US. About a month ago they signed a $10mil system supply contract for a project in the US. In addition, it has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by TD Securities Inc. (the “Underwriters”) pursuant to which the Underwriters have agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 9,220,000 common shares of the Company (the "Shares") at a price of $2.17 per Share, for gross proceeds of approximately $20 million (the "Offering") yesterday. Shares were diluted but it immediately rocketed back up.

With Biden presidency, as well as the rapid growth of Renewable energy, I wouldn't be surprised if this stock hits $3 or more next month. The prime minister of Canada has also recently chimed in with the fight for climate change and are turning to Renewable energy.

Give me your thoughts on this.

Have a nice day!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is wrong with Vital Farms? (VITL) Been doing a lot of research on this company lately.  Seems like something is intrinsically wrong with the company as a whole, or some insider/market manipulation is very strong.  I love the company and what they stand for, but it's really just losing value every week for no reason that I can figure out.  It initially priced its IPO at $15-17.  Went public at $22.

**Infrastructure construction company with renewable energy (66% of revenues) and specialty civil (34%) expertise**

* Both of which should see huge government funding with Biden (e.g., Biden plan includes $1.7 TRILLION in spending to address climate change)

**Solid backlog and growth**

* $1.9 billion backlog 9/30/20 represents 1.1x 2020E revenue
* 56% three year expected revenue CAGR
* 18% YOY expected revenue growth (2020E vs 2019)

**Profitable and low capex**

* 9/30 YTD EBITDA $99M 2020 vs. $54M 2019
* 9/30 TTM EBITDA $146M 2020 vs. $35M 2019
* 2020E EBITDA $117.5 - $125M vs. $101M 2019 vs. $14M 2018
* Low capex – $3.5M net capex (net of equipment sales) over the THREE year period 2017-2019; $2.6M net capex 9/30/20 YTD

**Good balance sheet (figures as of 9/30/20)**

* $180M net debt
* $205M preferred stock
* $468M common stock (as of 1/19/21)

* 7x EV/2020E EBITDA
* Jacobs Engineering 23x EV/EBITDA

**RISKS AS I SEE THEM**

* Potential for dilution with Series A and B Preferred Stock

The U.S. stock market could roar higher if President-elect Joe Biden is able to smooth out the country’s rocky start to Covid vaccinations. 

Biden has pledged to deliver 100 million doses in his first 100 days. Last week, he detailed his plan to do so, which includes tapping the National Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up large-scale vaccination sites across the country. Biden also plans to accelerate the availability of Covid vaccines at local pharmacies.

I know there was another thread about this, but I can't find it and have a lot to say, but the topic is massive and nuanced, and it directly relates to dozens of holdings discussed here ad nauseum, so please have patience with this additional thread. 

Facts ([per the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/20/chinese-billionaire-jack-ma-makes-first-public-appearance-in-months)): 

1. Jack Ma is an outspoken, opinionated, sometimes controversial figure, very prominent in Chinese culture. (opinion: Elon Musk is a solid American contemporary to use as a base understanding of Ma's influence and cult of personality.) His disappearance was a MASSIVE deal. 
2. He was last seen on 24 Oct, pissing off the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). His disappearance gained little to no attention for nearly two months, until he was removed and replaced as a judge from what I am guessing can be loosely regarded as a version of Shark Tank for businessmen in Africa. He was also conspicuously pulled from all promotional pieces. This caught global headlines in December.  
3. Amid global speculation and watching his pride and joy Alibaba continue to shed tens of billions of dollars in market value, he remained silent for another month. 
4. He resurfaced as part of a small-time annual event for approximately 100 rural teachers. Notable quotes include: "My colleagues and I have been studying and thinking, and we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare...Working hard for rural revitalisation and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.” Notable quotes do NOT include: anything relevant to his time away or the timing of his reappearance. 

Interpretations:   


1. An early version of a Bloomberg headline claimed his re-emergence "end\[ed\] speculation" about his months out of public view. False. Aside from the gaping holes of knowledge which remain unaddressed, the quotes we DO have from him also paint a pretty dark commentary about what it means to live in China.  
2. "My colleagues and I" -- Hold up. Which colleagues? Were there any less-famous Chinese moguls or Ma associates who were also missing? How many? 
3. "...have been studying and thinking..." Studying what, exactly? Why did they take three months to think about it? To me, this paints pictures of the Uighur "Reeducation Camps" (concentration camps, forced labor camps, whatever you want to call these terrifying places) and China's ongoing practice of forced propaganda indoctrination. 
4. "...we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare" ... His historic pet project Ant Group was shattered in globally humiliating fashion, reducing his wealth by 11 figures in literally an instant, and sending the value of his assets further downward by another 11 figures over the following weeks and months, and his first public comments are about--wait for it--devotion to education and public welfare? Fucking terrifying, especially in light of the previous point.  
5. "Working hard for rural revitalisation and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen." This is designed to be a statement communicating a noble and respectable value, and if all businessmen of the world felt this way, humanity as a whole would be better off. But what I see is a deafeningly loud and clear threat from CCP to every last one of "our generation of businessmen."

Bottom line: 

* Investing in Chinese holdings is something I plan to continue, but on smaller levels with smaller holdings across more companies. However, this all underscores just how impossible it is to assess risk in Chinese investments. Without feeling confident that you have your finger on the pulse of whether the CEOs and Boards of Directors for all companies you hold are successfully staying out of CCP's crosshairs, we must consider every last Chinese company to be under a completely unpredictable and wholly existential threat at all times. I fully believe that had Jack Ma just stfu and kept his eyes on the road, Ant Group IPO would have happened, and BABA's share price would be approaching $400 by now, instead of breathing a sigh of relief in the $260's, without a $37 billion IPO in its future, and with an anti-trust investigation still waiting to play out. 
* Also: friendly reminder that Chinese securities traded in American markets aren't shares or stock, they're American Depository Receipts (ADRs). On a fundamental level, the value of these can technically cease to exist at the whim of the Chinese government. I imagine that being in the final 90 minutes of the Trump administration somewhat reduces the threat posed by this risk, but it is and will remain an ever-present reality.

- hold good-performing stocks for a long time
- gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.

I am a long time small investor (about 10 years) and I always have played a bit different stocks then I see usually here or on WSB itself. As I am in Europe I am also more centered around companies over here as it is easier to source information. I often bought stocks that after an earning report or some big media event (dieselgate) drastically crashed like VW, SAP, Nokia and so on. I always felt these companies where just too big to fail while still having a good swab of cash on had, decent overall all performance and interesting RnD.

I have been in an out of Nokia over the past 10 years always managing to catch a good wave. I got back in with about 50% of my portfolio beginning of November after the stock within a couple of days tanked about 20%. I have some friends in the telecoms and network industry that work with some of the giants and I was just asking around what they think about 5G in general, and how Nokia is playing in their hands. All across the board I got info that it is basically Ericsson and Nokia they are flogging to as due to obvious reasons Huawei is a no go. Now from what I understand these large companies also don't acquire infrastructure and solution from one company - they have to naturally spread it out over multiple. With not that many in the game for the specific solutions they need it seems to me that a large part of the market will be shared between Nokia and Ericsson no mater what. 

I ultimately have bet on Nokia, due to having trust in the new CEO who is a know figure at Nokia, their increase in RnD concerning solutions around 5G, their big trove of patents and a fair amount of cash at hand. I genuinely think with a bit of luck and wits they can build a strong platform in a couple of years to be a key contender in network solutions and I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of the stocks that might double their value in the foreseeable future.

Anyways - would be curious how the rest sees it, as this is definitely not a popular stock in general._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ibkr "Stop price" in a sell trailing order. Hey! I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this question in, but I'm not sure where else to post it.
Basically, I know how a sell trailing order works, but the thing that sort of confuses me is the "Stop price" while filling an order. I tried searching for it online, but most of the explanations I found didn't really directly answer my question.
So let's say that AMD is currently trading at $90, and I'm thinking about selling this stock when it goes up to around $95 because I think there could be a bit of resistance there and I'm not sure whether it will plummet to $92 from there or jump till $100.
So if I understood most of the things correctly, let's say I input the following order with a current price of $90:
SELL, Stop price $92, trailing $0.50.
So does that mean that the trailing order will only become active once the price reaches $92, and nothing will happen until it reaches it? Even if the price drops from $90 to $80?
And also does it mean that the minimum possible price this order can be sold at is $91.50 (or the next available market price)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in Technology/Growth Stocks which haven't seen significant growth since March 2020 It seems that every time I look at literally any stock graph, you can see a massive peak from March 2020 onwards resulting in the stock being 3-5 X more expensive than it was just one year ago. Examples are: Tesla, Square, Zillow and many others.

Let's say though that I'm a value investor who wants to avoid overpaying for a technology/growth stock, what options do I have? My criteria are the following:

1) Stock's value growth has been less than 2x since March 2020.
2) Company's Debt to Equity ratio is less than 2, preferably less than 1. (This minimises the probability the company will go bankrupt if the stock market crashes).
3) Company still has at least 5% annual growth projected in the next years.

Based on this criteria, the only option I could find was INTEL! And I might consider dropping £1000 into Intel as my long term play. However, I am looking for other finds from people here, please share any knowledge you have!

Ask price drops to 270.61 while I'm watching it. I'm not getting any shares still. What is going on? My orders never seem to fill before and after market...am I using the wrong type of order?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to trade stocks multiple times a week without being considered a day trader? Fundamentally hear me out, here’s a hypothetical scenario that I’m contemplating: 

I have 19.97 shares in nano dimension, I bought in at $9.29 which costed me $185.6

Nano is at $11.02, thus I’ve returned $34.56 and my shares value to $220.16

Nano like most other stocks fluctuates a lot, HYPOTHETICALLY if I’m predicting that nano is gonna drop back down to around $10 soon coming off of this green day, if I sold at $11.02, I’d have made a profit of $34.56 and would have $220 available now which I would plan to put back in at a lower price point. Again hoping it drops to near $10, that’s where I would try to buy back in. 

If my prediction and hope is correct and all goes perfectly: 

Buying back in at $10, I have $220 available. I can buy 22 shares thus turning my original profit into 2 more shares from the $185 I started with.

Now let’s say in the next week or two after I buy back in at $10, nano shoots up to $12. 


At $12:


My net return (from the original $185) with 22 shares would be $79 and my portion of the shares would be valued at $264.

But if I had just held and not done this hypothetical sell at 11, buy back at 10, my return would be $55 and my shares would be valued at $240. 

This is hypothetical, while I am thinking about doing this, I’m more concerned with IF I can even do this without having the requirements to be a day trader. 

So obviously I’m a broke boy, I don’t have money like that and thus I’m not technically allowed to day trade. I’m working with what I got. And With that said could I avoid being labeled a day trader if I per-say traded nano nearing the end of trading hours ofc assuming it would still be at $11 and did the buy in at $10 the following day or so. And if so, as in I’m allowed to do this, how many times a week could I do this?

*All I need is the answer to the question at hand regarding if I’m allowed to sortve day trade in the way I described, however if you’re open to giving advice on what I’m contemplating, I’m all ears, I’m a beginner trader and I’ll soak in knowledge like a sponge so below is the background on how exactly and why I am thinking about doing this*

If you’d like to give some advice do you think based on the scenario I’ve given, what I’m contemplating is ‘smart’ or would you suggest holding would be much ‘smarter’? And before you yell at me for contemplating doing things so risky, I know it’s risky, what I mean by ‘smart’ is do you believe it’s worth the risk? While I’m not like Wall Street bets crazy risky lol I am risky and willing to take risks, I understand that in my situation as low income as my family is and everything, I want to take risks to make money because if I do it right I can in fact make solid money, its what I believe I’ll have to do in my current position as well: unemployed searching for a job currently as I’ve decided to take a break from college. 

So in all reality my options are 1: either hold to keep making profit as nano is a solid stock to be in on, 2: get risky and try to finesse myself some more shares for more profit (what I described above), or another topic I haven’t spoke on is 3: forgetting the plan above and instead just making a call for nano to hit $12 in the next month for example._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Jan 20, 2021 These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed posts.

Furthermore, the majority of its holdings are in foreign companies and I’m not convinced Biden’s administration will lead to significantly more adoption of green energy on foreign soil. 

This ETF was trading in the $10 area for the last ten years until the v-shaped recovery started and then Biden was elected and it rocket shipped. I don’t get the argument of cheaper and more accessible green tech because green tech isn’t that much better off than it was a year ago when it was trading at $12. When I look at peoples reasoning for holding ICLN it’s almost always because either Biden was elected or because green tech is cheaper and more feasible now. While I think green sectors will see an increase in valuations, I just don’t see either of those reasons panning out for this specific ETF. Am I missing something else?

So I leaned using fundamental analysis to value a value stock (not meme ones, so no momentum ), I can use trend analysis based on EPS,  the bench marking P/E for same sector peers, and also the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). 

So the DDM assumes the present value of a stock should be priced by the future dividends. Then ***Question 1 is***, what interest rate should I use for reference, assuming I'm in US.  I know the growth rate in the formula is somewhat subjective, which I can try to infer based on previous performance. 

&#x200B;

Now, I was watching people doing analysis on stock price by calculating the intrinsic price of a company, using the projected future cash flow. In essence, he is taking the earning report to see the projected revenues and EBITDA, historical data to see the NFAT/EBITA and company growth rate, to derive a series of future EPS, and the sum of that EPS discounted to today, should be the value of the stock. 

***Question 2 is,*** I see by using different growth rate on can gauge the projected cash flow, but how do I use it to actually calculate the EPS discount? Is it similar to the DDM model where I use the calculated EPS divided by the (interest rate - my estimated growth rate)? 

**Question 3**, then, isn't DDM and this intrinsic value calculation the same? If not, what is the difference, which I should I use under what assumption?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Little GEVO story My little GEVO story

OTC: ENGMF
FSE: 2AV

Hey Everyone, 

If you are looking to expand into a really fast growing industry, I would highly recommend looking at Enthusiast Gaming. This stock is currently trading at $7.02CAD and I know this is going to double or even Triple this year alone. 

Hear me out…This is the largest gaming network in North America! 
To give you a quick summary about them, they have a reach of 300+ million gamers every month….you heard that right, each month!!! They own over 100 gaming websites, 1000 YouTube channels, 7 professional esports teams, they host dozens of gaming events each year (virtually right now)…and that’s just the beginning! 

The company’s final financial numbers for 2020 have not been released yet but it is expected to be over $150 million dollars! (2019 was $110 million) Solid growth year over year but its going to see even bigger growth in 2021….they made a 3-year growth strategy and 2021 is year 2 of the plan. Now they are focusing on Phase 2 & 3 that is ‘Monetize through advertising’ & ‘Sell Content’ such as subscriptions and licensing. This is where all the big money is going to start rolling in!!! 

Another thing I really like about this company is the leadership team owns 30% of the company! You know they are working their ass off to grow an amazing company but to also make some serious $$$$. The chair of the board is Francesco Aquilini owns around 16% of enthusiast gaming and he is part owner of the Vancouver Canucks. This company is in good hands and they know the sporting industry inside and out. 

Brand partnerships with tons of fortune 500 companies…Samsung, Bell, Amazon, PlayStation, Nintendo….just to name a few. 

Also the biggest catalyst is that they are currently being audited so that they can be listed on the NASDAQ. Once listed on the NASDAQ this company is going to grow huge! I expect to the announcement for listing to come out this quarter as they announced this audit back on November 9, 2020. 

I posted about this company a month ago and it was trading at $2.90…..now its $7. I think this company can reach $20+ in 2021. 

Ill link the website so you can check out everything yourself. Do your own DD as I am not a financial advisor.

https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question for Everyone I have a question on calls win/loss

Hey everyone, 

I’ve been doing research on calls / options lately. I wanted to fully understand it, before I get into it. Can someone explain exactly who loses and who wins on calls.
The way I understand it, is that you can buy a contract of 100 shares for a lot cheaper. I.e 1 contract for .85 cents each at the strike $ 30.85. I understand it in a  way that if it goes past the price you can sell for a profit of $30 per share? Who loses that money? If it doesn’t hit the price, who wins my $? 

Thanks in advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SRNE HUGE!!! Potential CURE for COVID $SRNE Announced that they will be presenting data for their STI-2020 antibody COVID treatment. 

So basically how it works is that you administer the treatment through a shot, and within 4 hours your body starts producing antibodies that kill the virus. This could potentially kill the virus within 4 days. MOREOVER, With the neutralizing antibody in your system, there is no need for social distancing!!!

Sounds too good to be true? Right? Not exactly. This project received $34 Million in funding from DARPA as $SRNE beat out Regeneron ($REGN) and $LILLY. 

Not only that, but tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday they will be presenting data to show that not only has it been proven effective, it also is effective against the strains from South Africa and the UK, which REGN And LILLY are not. 

“Sorrento to Present Data Demonstrating STI-2020 Preserves Binding Against UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Mutated Spike Protein”

The two competitors are having issues with administering their treatments as hospitals are finding it hard setting up the infrastructure for it, as you beed to be on an IV drip for hours. The $SRNE antibody treatment can be administered through a shot in seconds. 

I can’t believe it myself, BUT this could be the answer to COVID. 

Not only that, but they have a string of other products in the pipeline waiting for approval such as COVI-STIX. A test that you could potentially buy at CVS and administer at home for a result within 2-15 minutes like a pregnancy test! 

This is HUGE. I am long on $SRNE, and considering they just released this data, I don’t even know where to put my PT at._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ticker Discussion - $BDRBF (Bombardier) I have to say, in all the fun of flipping stocks this year, this one has been the most interesting. It came into my radar weeks after climbing rapidly from $0.22/share up to $0.38/share. I noticed that it didn’t have a big sell off. It stayed at that tier. At the time I said ok I’ll get in, and I did somewhere around $0.385/share. For the next 5 weeks it just fluctuated in the $0.36-0.40 range, really nothing to worry about. But last week it had 4 big positive days and is now up to around $0.475/share. Friday it maintained this level, no rapid sell off. I changed my limit order from $0.50 to $0.48 and said that’s a nice 6 week gain none the less. They didn’t trade OTC markets on Monday but this morning I woke up to a sale execution at 9:30am. It triggered and sold at $0.4869/share, not bad. The rest of the day it maintained back in that $0.465-0.475 level like before, still no dips.

The reason I bring this to discussion is because I want to understand some of the possible reasoning behind this. I don’t normally trade OTC, but this is a big company that I’m familiar with much of their work. And since it was Canadian, I figured they had big bailout chances. Worst case scenario if I became a bag holder, I would just move it into my long-term account and hope that it goes back to $1.40, where it was pre-covid.

Anyone else have any input on this ticker? I’m surprised to see it move in tiers and not daily volatility like most other major tickers.

P.S. For those who want to tell me I’m stupid to sell, just hold long term! I trade daily, so it’s not like the money isn’t being attempted to grow in other tickers now. But i like a +25% gain, in such a small time frame, when i see one lol 😅😅_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Has any one else been paying attention to XL Fleet(XL) ? I’m a newbie investor. Been at this only for a few months so I don’t necessarily speak the language of one that is very experienced, but I’ve had my eyes on XL Fleet for a few weeks now. They rallied up from $10 to $33 between mid November to late December. And now the stock is corrected at $19. 

They work in vehicle electrification solutions. Was founded in 2009 but just recently IPO’d at $9.85 in late 2019. Just to give some back ground. 

I’m not necessarily the most experienced investor but I see a golden opportunity especially as we go through this inauguration and going forward with the rapid industry of EV’s and everything of the sorts. Looking at its graphs it looks like it’s about to go through the roof after that major correction. 

Needless to say I bought the dip. I’m very confident in this company and would like to know your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Website/app recommendation for logging and tracking trades I've recently become a very active trader, borderline day trading. I use different apps for trading depending on OTC availability.

I've seen [Profit.ly](https://profit.ly/) and [Trademetria.com](https://trademetria.com/). I'm wondering if either of these are worth the money, or if there are good free alternatives.

**MY FAVORITE: CANF,CNCE, EYE, NGD, SSRM, WMT**



$AEYE - Descending Triangle which isn't great, but a possible breakout. Really great area of reward, just bouncing off the 50EMA line as well. Indicators also look good.

[https://tos.mx/AZ1eyVs](https://tos.mx/AZ1eyVs)

&#x200B;

$ATNX - Great area of value, just needs to break the 50EMA line. Good value, just not much more going for it. Indicators look good though, just needs to show some green.

[https://tos.mx/iJ8r5xk](https://tos.mx/iJ8r5xk)

&#x200B;

$CANF - Fantastic channel, higher lows, and great potential. Love that it is at support as well. Indicators are all fair, but I love the price action.

[https://tos.mx/rVTjlkr](https://tos.mx/rVTjlkr)

&#x200B;

$CNCE - Massive selloff, right into support. Do I think it is too good to be true, kind of. But it showed life before close here. Indicators look fantastic as well.

[https://tos.mx/eoT2TXL](https://tos.mx/eoT2TXL)

&#x200B;

$EYE - Absolute unit of a channel up. Also at support, it is super beautiful right here. Hovers above the 200EMA which it is known to do. Beautiful indicators as well.

[https://tos.mx/FRbYRZ4](https://tos.mx/FRbYRZ4)

&#x200B;

$FLXN - Great channel up from here, I want to see a breakout. 200EMA bounce play right here as well. Could drop a tad more. Indicators are fair right now.

[https://tos.mx/haiO1G0](https://tos.mx/haiO1G0)

&#x200B;

$KO - Massive sell off, right into support and trend support. Looking for a great long term hold. Everything is oversold obviously and has room to run up easily.

[https://tos.mx/Ct2tgQ7](https://tos.mx/Ct2tgQ7)

&#x200B;

$NGD - Great channel here. Such a nice support area and often breaks 200EMA to come right back. I love this channel. Indicators look great, could reverse very close.

[https://tos.mx/sgLU6Na](https://tos.mx/sgLU6Na)

&#x200B;

$SSRM - Obvious channel down, but we right at the bottom of it though. Holding support, and I love this channel overall. Indicators all oversold, and looking to reverse soon.

[https://tos.mx/2c8Ctvv](https://tos.mx/2c8Ctvv)

&#x200B;

$WMT - Beautiful channel up here. Right where we want it to be, and sharing support as well. All indicators look to be ready to reverse. I think this is a low risk medium reward.

A cash account good faith violation happens if I use the gains from closing a position XY to open a new position Z and close the newly opened position Z before the funds settle from XY's closing. In a margin account does this simply not apply or is the opening of Z paid for entirely through margin (to the extant I do not have settled funds to pay for it)? 

2. If paid through margin:

(A) Do I have to pay interest on the margin used to open Z if I close Z before the end of the day?
(B) Will the funds from XY settling immediately pay off my margin or do most brokerages require you to go and do this manually?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD 1Life healthcare $ONEM What it is: membership based primary care.

Why it's relevant: primary care and doctor appointments take forever to get into, this allows quick access and people with the means to subscribe are subscribing to this like mad.

Why it'll go up: anyone with any means outside of medicaid/medicare will be using this. Healthcare expansions unfortunately has to work within the confines of limited healthcare providers like doctors. People will want to forego 2month wait times and use this service. It's already implemented and being used like crazy. This and remote health/telehealth are the future of primary care. 

FWIW I am a healthcare provider, I have spoken with recruiters from ONEM, I know people who do independent direct access primary care and they've filled up their patient panels within a few months if opening.it is difficult to open a single practice for them and ONEM does it at scale.

As there feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel as winter comes to a close and the vaccine becomes more accessible there should be an obvious bounce back in oil, airlines, and entertainment stocks. 

I missed pulling the trigger on Dave and Busters but there is another stocks that I think can bounce back as people start going out again more. I feel that Eventbrite (EB) is at a nice entry point for price and should have a strong hold on selling tickets and providing E tickets. Maybe it can have a run like Zillow is having.

If I sell covered calls but decide I want to get out of stock whose shares underlie the call, is there a way to "buy back" the option contracts I sold so I no longer have an obligation to sell my shares if allocated? Is this as simple as buying calls at the same strike and expiration? If so, how does cost basis work? Is my realized gain just the net differences in the total premium of the two?

2. What happens if my brokerage account only has authority to sell covered calls and sell cash-backed puts (nothing naked) and I try to sell all of the shares used to sell a covered call? Will the brokerage allow me to do this or will it create an error telling me I'm not authorized for naked calls?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short term shorting of stocks I'm a total newbie at this, and I would like more experienced people to critique my strategy.

Before I start trading in the real market, I started using Wall Street Survivor as a simulator.

My first "strategy" was to look at stocks that had a steady (minimum 1%) increase for 5 days in a row.  My plan was to buy on day #5, with the assumption that a stock that had risen 5 days in a row at 1% would be unlikely to decrease suddenly on day #6.  I planned to sell the stock 24 hours after buying it, for a very small but consistent profit.

This strategy did not work well.  Out of the 20 different stocks I bought, 17 of them decreased the day after I bought it compared to it's prior 5 day trend.  So I abandoned that strategy.

My second strategy was to look at the most volatile price increases and make the assumption that there would be some downward correction after a major jump.  For example OBSV stock jumped almost 100% in 2 days between 1/15 and 1/16.  I shorted the stock on 1/16 after it had gone up 93%, and cover when it decreased by 15%, which leads to a profit of 15% on 1 day.  

I did a similar short strategy with other highly volatile stocks, on those 20 stocks I successfully shorted on 17 of them, leading to a total profit of 42%

Now obviously that was probably a fluke, and I will continue this strategy for awhile to make sure it's somewhat viable over a longer term, but I found it interesting that shorting a stock after a big increase seems to be a more reliable strategy than trying to buy a stock that seemed to have consistent gains in the days prior to buying.

Now this was all on the Wall Street Survivor simulator, not on a real brokerage account.  Can somebody give me info on the mechanics of how a real brokerage account is different?  I'm assuming there's a much longer lag time between when you place an order and when it is executed on a real platform, correct?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How many companies are in your portfolio? I have about 10k in the market distributed in about 15 different companies. I have a couple stocks that are 12% each of my portfolio, and the rest are less.

I’ve been in the market for about a year.

Curious, how many companies are in your portfolio?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some things you wish you knew when you started? Hi guys,

I'll give a brief summary about myself and situation: 

I've entered the stock market about two months ago. I do my own research. I do a lot of research about learning different research processes. I lurk many threads.
I started with an initial investment of 4k. I am + 1.5k as of now. I am quite happy with this, to be honest.
I am unsure if this is a satisfying increase for the amount invested. Opinions? 
I only invest in growth stocks. Long term. Yes, I do diversify, but only step into a new stock if it meets my criteria. No fomo. 
I started a new job and this gives me the ability to add 500 monthly to my portfolio. 
I've read several mindset books, but I am looking to learn more. Stagnation is death, as far as I have been taught. 
My current goal is to be +100k within 3 years. Absurd, right? Shoot for the stars kind of mindset. 
I am hoping some people who have been at this for a bit longer than me have some, tips and pointers for me to help me take the next step forward. Things you found out late you regret not knowing sooner type of stuff. 


Thanks! 

R_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICLN vs. QCLN Hi everyone. I’m newer to trading, and I’ve been struggling with this question for awhile now.

I own 64 shares of ICLN (~$2,000), purchased this morning at $31.18. I know ICLN is international, with ‘safer’ companies than QCLN. Since Biden is taking office, I’m presuming that clean energy stocks will rise. Especially companies in the US.

I’ve been looking at QCLN also, which is more US based. They hold Tesla, Plug, and NIO, all which are (in my opinion) more volatile. But since most of these are US based, will this one rise more? 

My question: should I sell all my ICLN stocks and transfer to QCLN? Why or why not? 

I believe QCLN will rise more due to Biden. Tell me why I’m wrong!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone investing in BRK.B alternatives? I'm brand new to the market but it's pretty easy to see that the monolith that is Berkshire Hathaway could possibly be treated as an EFT in its own right. But due to its size, the historic gains it has achieved will become harder and harder to replicate. 

Not only that, the main man himself is coming to the end of a wonderful career and it introduces a degree of uncertainty. Introducing the need for smaller, younger alternatives.

Does anyone invest in companies as a direct alternative to B.H.? Are there any companies that could be considered as safe (or near enough), with less risk in future? More potential for growth?

Again, I'm pretty new. I don't know if B.H. will be the best option for a long time to come, but I'm young enough that I'm willing to accept a bit more risk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can the short interest for a company be over 100%?

Hey all, I'm pretty new to the stock market and don't know much. Anyway I found this stock that has an EPS of $98.72 yet the stock is only $1.85 a share.
