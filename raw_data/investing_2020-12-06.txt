 MUNI Bonds with 20+% yield? Hello, 

[https://www.municipalbonds.com/bonds/issue/108472AA9/](https://www.municipalbonds.com/bonds/issue/108472AA9/)

YIELD        : 22.964%   
MATURITY: 2029 May  
Investment: $15,000

I have been researching on MUNI bonds and came across this attractive bond, which is far more difficult to believe. 

My requirements are: 

\> Tax free gains (I'm aware of Roth, Megaback door Roth,..etc). I live in a State tax free state, so my only concern is on Federal taxes 

\> Though, I love researching different stocks and index funds, if there is a 20% ROI on an index fund, I would love to go with that option. 

\> I'm 31 and I've emergency savings for 5 months and I've $20,000 extra cash which I would like to invest. Municipal bonds seems like a good option as it provides tax-free gains. 

&#x200B;

What are the issues that I need to be aware about while buying these type of bonds? 

I use Fidelity for my investments, but I'm not able to find these type of MUNI bonds, is there any other recommended brokers where I can buy these? 

If MUNI bonds is not an option, what are the other options to invest the $20K? Stocks and ETFs are the ones I have in mind. Any help is greatly appreciated.

The stock would be purchased via a foreign brokerage and I'd have to transfer them to my US-based brokerage.

I am usually a small time value investor in some funds and mostly stocks so don’t often short stuff, but I am game to short Tesla, for my own reasons. 

Anyway I was hoping to use about £500 and short it, I want to maximise returns as I do feel it will drop significantly.

Given it has exceeded my original price target, I have realized my position.

Now I turn my attention to For Hims, a rapidly growing telehealth platform which is valued at a substantial discount to its peers - TDOC, AMWL, GDRX (and formerly LVGO) based on forward revenue multiples. Today, OAC (the SPAC that has entered into a definitive agreement to combine with Hims later this year or early next), is trading at $10.90. Based on the deal value, 3-400% upside exists if Hims trades in line with its peers.

As you can see from the materials linked to below, Hims is 1) growing as fast if not faster than peers 2) is already profitable while TDOC and AMWL are not and 3) is a clear category leader in the B2C telehealth and digital pharma space that will be an attractive area for future acquirers.

Anyone recently transfer out of Firstrade, if so how was the experience?

1) Did Firstrade liquidate fractional shares from stocks w/ DRIP or over the counter or international stocks as a part of the transfer? 

2) Were cost basis records successfully transferred, or was it an accounting nightmare come tax time? 

3) Was the transfer smooth (taking ~6 business days) or was it exceptionally slow (weeks?) or required additional paperwork?

I know this is a dumb question probably but I want to understand the theory behind this (of course I’m not going to invest in options as I don’t understand enough but I want to understand the reason) 

Basically a really low strike price for a call options premium is usually trading at a very close amount to the actual stock price. So from what I would understand it wouldn’t take a lot for it to become in the money.  For example CRSR is currently trading at $35.68. With a strike price of $25 we can buy a call option for $10.85 meaning a $0.18 increase will make the stock in the money. But then a strike price of $35 for a premium of $3.43. (Both have same expiration date)

Their probably is a reason and I’m not understanding it, if someone could explain the reasoning behind this because then why wouldn’t people just buy the low strike price call option if it takes significantly less to become in the money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cash Rich Companies VS Bonds A month or so ago watched a show in which the presenter said how some companies (apple, Google, Microsoft, etc) have so much cash and generate alot of cash, that in a way they safe/better than buying government bonds today.

If a mutual fund manager rebalances say once every quarter, does an automated portfolio stand to benefit from more frequent rebalancing during a period of heightened volatility (buying dips, selling highs)? I know mutual funds are the mainstays of retirement accounts but assuming periods of volatility are a necessary evil throughout the lifecycle of a fund, I wonder if this makes the case for a more frequent rebalancing solution.

Aside from things like tax loss harvesting and actual underlying fees that may have a larger effect on overall performance I’m curious if there’s any research or data on this topic. Or are robos still too new for us to have a good sense of this?

Love to hear your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Indexes, Weighting, and Frequency of Recalculation I have been doing some learning on how index funds are calculated. Below is a summary of my understanding and some questions.

For example, Vanguard's Small-Cap ETF (VB) is based on the CRSP US Small Cap Index. I believe the weighting of the CRSP US Small Cap Index is reevaluated quarterly. The weighting is based on company capitalization vs total market cap. This means Vanguards % of the fund for a stock will be based off the weighting CRSP has calculated.

&#x200B;

Assuming everything I mentioned above is accurate (and please correct me if I am wrong):

1. If a company did poorly and market cap dropped by 30% after earnings, when CRSP is reevaluated and then Vanguard (and other funds) re-balances, the stock price would drop even more?
2. In theory, if you know the dates the recalculation happened in the past, you could predict what the new weight of specific stocks.
3. Do we know the dates every quarter that CRSP is recalculated? It looks like there reports on their site showing the last trading day of real quarter (last one being Sept 30).

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Great read from the American Institute for Economic Research on what gives Bitcoin value I’d recommend reading the whole article but here’s the TLDR. 

“For those who don’t want to slog through the entire article, my thesis is that Bitcoin’s value obtains from its underlying technology, which is an open-source ledger that keeps track of ownership rights and permits the transfer of these rights. Bitcoin managed to bundle its unit of account with a payment system that lives on the ledger. That’s its innovation and why it obtained a value and that value continues to rise.”

https://www.aier.org/article/why-does-bitcoin-have-value/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a meaningful difference between the airline and food deliver industries? \-High opex needs and low profitability. These industries almost can't scale up. Why? Because it's expensive to do what they do. Uber and Lyft are FCF negative and EBIT margins for both those companies are heavily negative.  Net revenues can grow all they want if it doesn't have to be profitbale.

&#x200B;

\-Both industries have heavy regulatory presence. The FAA runs the airline industry and there's an increasing regulatory presence in the food delivery industry also as we saw in California passing Prop 22. This limits, for better or worse, profitability in the future as it limits growth and as the food delivery industry struggles with how to classify drivers as employees or contractors.

&#x200B;

\-They're commoditized industries. I.E. fighting for pennies all the time. Consumers don't care how their food gets to them so long as it gets to them so they'll use whoever is cheapest. This eliminates pricing power and fully relies on the companies creating positive brand imaging. And brand imaging is pushed forward or backward by the drivers they pick. And these companies need as many drivers as possible, they can't be picky with the people that want to work for them. So how will they create positive brand imaging if you get any schmuck delivering your food to you late? We've seen news stories of DoorDash and Grubhub drivers eating people's food and delivering it late and cold. Which is no better than dealing with airlines. Everyone has a horror story about Delta or United (anyone remember Fight Club happening on a United flight? I do) about flights being canceled or flight staff being less than ideal or luggage being lost and so on. These are industries that are designed to fight for scraps from the consumers's pockets. Which doesn't bode profitability well.

&#x200B;

\-Growth is limited for both of these industries. Airlines have competitors all fighting for the same small space in their industry that they can grow in. It's high barriers to both enter and exit (think about it, if any one of them goes chapter 11 who is gonna buy out their planes? Who is going to move them out of airports and do so quickly?) but any mom and pop delivery service can compete with Uber and Lyft and DoorDash. The pennies that food delivery businesses are fighting for can be grabbed by anybody. Airlines are fighting for pennies in a closed ring. A closed ring that isn't growing. Food delivery fights for growth among anybody and everybody that wants in. 

&#x200B;

I have a quiet hunch that these  industries are more similar than they are different. Obviously this is not meant to be an exhaustive list and exceptions and particularities abound. But if you want to value a food delivery company then you may be better off seeing it the way you see an airline in terms of growth, brand imaging stewardship, profitability, industry outlook, etc._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who is buying Disney stock?

So I am curious about some information I heard. So my girlfriend is kinda critical about......... everything. She showed me a video which claims that on the 23th of march 2020, while the whole stock market was crashing,  the US senate debated a law about a digital currency. This law should eliminate all paper money within the next years. So all transactions will be digital.

To be honest I do believe that we will experience a very harsh policy about the removal of paper money. We already can see such things in China where they barely use paper money for bigger transactions (1000$ and above).

So I just have two questions about this:
-what do you think about it?
AND

-If it is possible that the whole banking system has no more paper for the citizens to use, which company can be used for managing, producing or handling the digital assets or transactions? I would really be interested in investing in some of those IT-companies, because they could bring some good return.

Onto new updates -

The Atlantic posted this article this morning - [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/easy-way-to-quit-smoking/617305/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/easy-way-to-quit-smoking/617305/)

This article does not call out xxii by name, but outlines that reducing nicotine content in cigarettes will save millions of lives in the US alone by 2100. It should lead to 5 millions smokers quitting within a year. It also prevents new generations from developing the nicotine addiction through cigarettes. XXII is the only company with the science to do this. Putting in place a nicotine mandate would require all of the tobacco companies to work with xxii to produce their own tobacco with very low nicotine. This would tremendously increase value to xxii stock. I am expecting xxii to call attention to this article. Wouldn't be surprised to see a nice green day on monday.

CEO Jim Mish made a presentation at a fall investors summit. Here he talked about how he feels this stock is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market, and talked about how MRTP approval has potential to multiply market cap by 10x or greater. 'woefully undervalued'. MRTP approval is inevitable could come any day now. He describes the nicotine mandate mentioned in the Atlantic article above as a 'grand slam' for xxii, and the MRTP approval a 'home run'.

Here is a link to the PDF of the presentation- [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf)

A few days after the above presentation, he purchased 100k shares of xxii at $.93. This caused a big increase in share price.

CEO Jim Mish also presented at the Cowen Cannabis Conference (virtual). This was to talk about both the tobacco and cannabis sides of the business. The tobacco side there wasn't too much of an update, just giving another audience the perspective of the company. On the cannabis side, he did say they have collected quite a variety of IP for cannabis, particularly for THC and other isolated/combined cannabinoids, and he said they want to start monetizing what they have in 2021.

Link to the video presentation in this tweet - [https://twitter.com/\_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542](https://twitter.com/_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542)

Their main focus has been nicotine and tobacco, but as of late their cannabis side has been pushing along. They have retail investments on the Panacea side and genomic/IP investments on their own and with KeyGene.

In addition to all of this which, on it's own is extremely exciting, they have a third plant-based venture to announce, noting that this third plant has many genomic similarities to the cannabis plant and also that the three plants (tobacco, cannabis, TBD..) are synergetic. This leads me to believe the third plant line has to do with hops. Just a guess.

Mish has been hyper focused on the mission of getting MRTP approved, pushing to get the cannabis side of the business making money, and getting investors on board. He has been setting up near bi-weekly conference calls like the LD micro 500. Just spreading the word and letting people know we are primed to go as soon as the FDA gives us the OK to market properly.

At a 20% profit margin (which is Apple's actual profit margin) that means Apple needs $30k in sales for every American to recognize a profit equal to its current market cap.

In general, people are buying Apple's products at a less frequent cadence than before (e.g., instead of a new iPhone every year, it seems people are moving towards buying a new iPhone every 5 years).

I get it, it's all about the services revenue. I agree, that is definitely an avenue for Apple's future. However, that seems more than priced in. There are 380m iPhones in use worldwide according to Statista. Let's just say that Apple can increase market share and cap out at 500 million users. At $10 a month, that implies $60 billion a year in annual services revenue. At a 50% margin (generous) and with that $10 a month revenue per user (very generous), that would imply $30 billion a year in services profit. At 20 time earnings (generous, considering this is high price point and high market share) that would imply $600 billion in value.

TLDR: Apple's current market cap is $2 trillion. This is a company growing at 5% a year with significant supply chain, demand, taxation, innovation, and disruption risks.

Good morning/evening everyone. AT&T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll (on r/dividends). There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed.

# AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph:

**Sector: Communication Services**

AT&T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments:

* AT&T Communications:

>AT&T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.

* AT&T International:

>AT&T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

* AT&T ad and analytics:

>Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.

* Warner Media’s HBO & Turner and Warner Bros divisions:

>Warner Media’s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world’s largest TV and film studio.

**Strengths:**

>\- Acquisitions have added to AT&T’s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).  
>  
>\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).  
>  
>\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)

**Risks:**

>\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.  
>  
>\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.  
>  
>\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants.

# Financial History:

Before diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments.

This first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|
|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|
|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|
|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|
|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|

Revenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins.

Debt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing.

Let's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\+362 Million|
|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\+9,138 Billion|
|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\+23,927 Billion|
|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\+35,882 Billion|
|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\-11,328 Billion|
|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\-13,603 Billion|

Net cash flow is very strong and growing \~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.

Now, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged.

Lastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.

So, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)

Anyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend.

# Direct TV:

AT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced.

Selling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on.

# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO:

These acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time.

In addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable.

There is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

The AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$29.54|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|19.44|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|
|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|

The payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.

However, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment.

Note though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit.

# Closing Thoughts:

This stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services.
