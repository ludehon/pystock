The market has been nuts and is probably due for a pullback but I’m not trying to short the big boys here.

Let’s find some names that might die out even as the market goes straight up. That is a suckers bet if you want to play a potential pullback._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME mooning on Monday and Tuesday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 How is every autist here not balls deep in GME stocks and calls?

Seriously how many times over the last year have we singlehandedly fucked every MM’s wife’s boyfriend with TSLA? 

How many other ridiculous meme stocks did we pump together as a group?

How many diamond handed autists did  we make fucking rich purely off of our own stupidity?

It’s the end of the year and we have a job to do my friends. We need to buttfuck these gay bears one last time and squeeze these degenerates harder than the ladyboys squeeze my erection in Thailand. 

All these insider trading cucks need to be punished for their crimes against humanity. Join me in fighting the good fight. 

GME is a safe bet long term anyway so if you wanna be a pussy just buy shares instead of calls. Just don’t paperhand that shit once you buy it. Buy and HOLD until it hits at least $50 and you’re balls deep in some hedge fund managers wife’s boyfriend.

Remember friends: it’s not gay if you like the taste. Then you’re just havin’ fun...

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Merry Christmas _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My daughter made this for me. Merry Christmas tards _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Autism in the movies - a retard's watchlist for the holidays I'm sure we all got some time off from Wendy's for the holidays and it's not like we're ever going to read a fucking book, so here's a little watchlist of movies/show based around Wall Street and finance for you retards, inspired by a comment on the daily.

I've seen pretty much all of them so hopefully you guys will make some suggestions too and I'll edit to add them.

# The classics

(I'm including those just so you won't spam the comments)

* **Wall Street** (and the shitty sequel)
* **The Wolf of Wall Street** \- Yeah you've seen it 10 times while pretending to jack off to Margot Robbie when you were really thinking about Jonah Hill
* **The Big Short** \- OG autistic action, I guess 🌈🐻s get a pass for this one

# Movies

* **Trading Places** \- What if WSB was around in the 80s? Two autist millionaires try to find out
* **Rogue Trader** \- A retard who would feel right at home here manages a new trading desk with 0 oversight. I think we can all relate. Based on the real story of Nick Leeson (or is it 1ronyman?) which is worth a read, but watch the movie first or it'll spoil the ending.
* **Boiler Room** \- Jesse Pinkman goes STONKS, BITCH and Vin Diesel doesn't blow shit up (except his clients accounts)
* **Margin Call** \- Those suck right? It's like that but for a whole investment bank during the 2008 crisis.
* **Barbarians at the Gates** \- Haven't seen this but it's about a guy trying to buy his own company. Probably a good watch for the week-end to get excited about incoming GME tendies

# Documentaries

* **Million dollar traders** \- They give random retards and a boomer a 2-week seminar and $1MM to trade, then proceed to manage them as loosely as possible. Somehow they don't all end up homeless. Can anyone become a trader? Apparently not a successful one, but you knew that already.
* **Floored** \- Before RobinHood, retards had to congregate in a pit and scream orders at each other. A nostalgic look at what it was and how it's now on life-support thanks to boomers who can't computer
* **Betting on Zero** \- Haven't seen this yet but it stars Bill SPACkman so you know it's gonna be good.
* **The China Hustle** \- Before SPACs of shitty Chinese companies were all the rage, reverse-mergers of total dogshit Chinese companies were the best way to throw money away with no idea of what's going on. Pretty eye-opening on the practices of Chinese companies before they all stopped of course, now they're 100% legit trust me blo.
* **Wall Street Warriors** \- Some are retards, some are autists, but somehow they all make money in finance, sometimes doing the stupidest shit. Shoutout to the jackass trading from home in his robe, I think we can all relate
* I'm excluding all the docs about the GFC, the fed, etc because we know the story: printer go brrr, banks yolo, 🌈🐻s make money for once, yada yada yada

# TV Shows

* **Industry** \- Autists with actual degrees start as trainees in the City. It's kind of weird and Bri'ish and they fuck a lot, but it's all about people on the actual trading floor which is kinda cool. New this year so there's only like 8 episodes.
* **Billions** \- I hesitate to put this here because it's more about politics and personal power-plays, but the main guy runs a hedge fund and a lot of the early seasons centers around that, plus he's rich and a dick about it so I automatically like him. And the other side will make you say "fuck the feds" which is true, fuck the feds._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Parent’s subtle hint that I need to end my gambling addiction... Jokes on them though, I can’t read. Can anyone give me a retard-proof synopsis? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $INFN is the perfect post-covid play and still a bargain at $11! Goldman article discussing this a while back: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/goldmans-turnaround-plays-for-2021-topped-by-las-vegas-sands.html?&qsearchterm=infn](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/goldmans-turnaround-plays-for-2021-topped-by-las-vegas-sands.html?&qsearchterm=infn) \- Semi-blocked for non-paying readers unfortunately.

**Who?**  
Infinera Corp is an established player in the transport market. They do various tech products and services such as cloud, 5G, fiber etc. for especially metro but also long haul and other transportation.

**Financials**  
First off, the company is mature and has a strong focus on gross margin, cost cutting as well as constantly moving into new, growing and promising markets.

From Q1'19 to Q3'20 (GAAP):  
Revenue is up 16.5%  
Gross margin is up from 22.7% to 35.2%  
OPEX is down from $178.1M to $112.6M  
EPS is up from ($.69) to ($.19)

While these financials are solid, they are not the flashiest found in the market. However, it is more so the current situation of the company as well as the outlook that could drive the stock through the roof in Q1 of 2021.

**Circumstances**  
Historically, the number one competitor of $INFN has been Huawei. Because of the recent developments for Huawei's operations in especially North America ($INFN's largest market), American customers are looking to switch to a solid American alternative.

Not only is California-based $INFN an innovative and proven alternative, it is also becoming more relevant in more areas (vertical integration). This makes it an obvious choice because of the all-in-one solutions they can provide for their customers, of which they are gaining by the minute (take a look in their financial statements).

Finally, the central metro market is only growing, both in the US, but also in EMEA and APAC (considerate share of $INFN sales).

**Conclusion  & current stock development**  
As the Goldman article at the top also mentions, $INFN has had negative cash flows and could be about to turn that around due to a few of the points made here. They continue to pivot and move into lucrative positions in very interesting markets with bleeding-edge tech (such as their 800G network transformation technology currently being rolled out) that for many customers can offer a competitive advantage. Moreover, the company is a proven, reliable and innovative alternative to Huawei which is on its way out of especially the American market. This leaves masses of potential value to be captured and to grow with.

Slowly moving on from covid, the economy is in need of new construction and creation meaning a huge rise in projects and therefore potential customers for $INFN. As Goldman agrees, this stock could be in for a rocket-ride in the first half of 2021 when their financials go from promising to delivering.

When the Goldman article came out, the stock went from around $7 to $11 and is now hovering. This could easily prove to be the beginning of much more. The potential value of their market is way bigger than their $2.1B. When their cash flows improve in their statements in 2021 and they continue to capture new customers, especially from their weak competitor of Huawei, this stock will rocket as it should already. Its potential is simply skyhigh (and way higher than $2.1B.

**TLDR**  
$INFN has innovative tech in multiple lucrative markets and a brilliant market situation because of the growing public transportation markets and weakened competitors. Goldman believe they will rocket in 2021 because of cash flows going positive and so do I.

Who the fuck agrees?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Chris Sacca on the "angry Robinhood Bros." I think he's mad because his wife is getting rammed through on Christmas by her boyfriend. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MT AND Cleveland-Cliffs, Two peas in a pod, DD I was doing some research on the MT, DD that u/vitocorlene wrote up, and was quite inspiring, So i decided to do a little digging in..

Every thing on his last DD was to the point but i want to add a second flavor that has become quite interesting, 

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. has completed its deal to purchase nearly all of  the assets of steel company ArcelorMittal USA for $1.4 billion.

Cleveland-Cliffs says it will be the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America, and  will also be the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America.

Post deal closure, Cleveland-Cliffs becomes the largest flat-rolled  steel producer in North America. Further, is expected to achieve around $150 million of estimated annual cost savings.

When buying MT you are purchasing there operation around the world, not the US side anymore, but is a loooooong operations list.

ArcelorMittal SA List if subsidiaries (These are what your buying MT on the NYSE) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1243429/000119312508060572/dex81.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1243429/000119312508060572/dex81.htm)Just minus the USA stuff..Most if it.

Cleveland-Cliffs      Lourenco Goncalves--> Gots the vision.....   New Pap Lourneco???

Also the new Alabama facility is a joint venture of ArcelorMittal SA and Nippon Steel, 

Check out the Futures for Steel and Iron, The world is building again especially china, Scrap metal is at a all time high, India is limiting exports to China and Turkey, China can fuck with the price a little but its not enough for the world demand, you can do your own research on this, look into Issues with China and Australia.. and India's Steel production issues 

My reasoning for this Writeup is to pay back the community that i have learned from, I still have no idea what im doing but this Autism has been goood!  

&#x200B;

I like both, Cleveland-cliff has the interesting story, still making up my mind on the numbers for Monday, just like Vito said its a long play to April or June maybe march.

Let me know what you think, 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR, 

 Buy both,  MT and CLF

ArcelorMittal SA has to buy stuff from Cleveland-Cliffs, to make metal in the USA

Since it's now cheaper to generate energy wind/solar even without subsidies, what felt like the distant future of solar and wind is here to stay, that is until one of you autists figures out cold fusion.

I ended up buying $PLT. I was partying with the rest of you because after a week I was up 30% in $PLT thinking I was on the Palantir train but if I held $PLTR I’d be up 80%. I’ve held for a month now and realized my mistake yesterday after market close._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Value stocks are a riskier buy now compared to two months ago In June I bought a lot of JWN thinking that once a vaccine would arrive, there was a lot of upside and time and again its support level had been tested and tried so I didn’t worry too much about it diving much and also didn’t fear bankruptcy (cheap me post history to confirm). 

Well, here I am about 120% up (and that’s only because sadly I bought a lot at ~$17, but then added three times as much at ~11.9. 

Anyway, I’ve considered taking my profits and selling it all now only to buy something else that’s currently cheap. JWN was like 80% down year to date when I bought that at 11.9 and now it’s only about 25 % down. 

So, I could go for airlines, cruises, oil companies, cinemas... and wait for them to do the same as JWN or even better as casino stocks (CZR, MGM). 

BUT, I feel like buying value stocks right now is super different from getting them six months ago.. or even two months ago. Mostly because now we have a vaccine and if stocks haven’t already recovered a fair amount or completely, there is likely a long term climb to face. So yeah sure it’s probably going to pay off in five years if you buy something like AAL, maybe AMC, NCLH or XOM.. but I doubt there’s going to be a 100 % rally just around the corner - at least I feel it’s much more uncertain than what I was aiming for pre-vaccine with JWN. It just seemed so simple.

Plus, JWN still is 25 % down so if all goes well it has more recovery to do. It feels less risky than buying into NCHL which could be a 5 year thing before it climbs big time.

Oh my fellow retards and autists, how much I had doubted your ways before you converted me! Just like GME I'm only getting started in Q4 of this year; as my positions clearly show I started right at the end of this week.


So this time of the year is the proper time to start new traditions, here's mine for this year. I'll post my stats for the year with the corresponding proof, laying out the highs and lows, talk shit about all those who doubted me or post some loss porn for you fuckers getting off to it. 


This year doesn't have much to show since I've only recently been converted. But so far the last two months have gained over 17% which is nothing to the craisziness you retards post regularly, but it's enough to put a smile on my face!


I had started with 'optimally' levaraged ETFs and TSLA stocks (until my broker no longer offered levaraged TSLA long). I went full retard starting 30th of april and bought GME at the top for 19$, then went on to sell everything I could, maxed out my credit cards and left barely enough to pay the next rent into GME. This brought my average down to 17.02$ right before ER. I took out about 600$ to convert it into calls but the transaction still needs to go through.


So unless I manage to lose everything YOLOing it into something retarded I plan on upping this to at least 40k next year. I could pay off all debts and have 20k left to gamble in 2022. 


So merry christmas you retards, I hope you have some nice and crispy tendies next year!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Adding NKLA here _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MP materials (MP) Picks and shovels play for EV & everything electric And not just EV!

How is this not at $200 yet?!? I’m thinking of throwing everything into this one. Should I?!?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quick! You've caught a case of the "Paper Hands!" Hello there, Merry  🎄 Christmas!  It seems you've been making plays based off of /r/wallstreetbets top posts, but you always buy at the top and sell when it drops! You may have a intermediate case of the mysterious paper hands. Don't worry though, this holiday season can still be reversed if you've lost all of your gains to to $BABA weeklies, take a look below and allow me to introduce myself.

I'm dopydon, $GME trading mastermind, who can easily fix all of your horrendous day trades. There's a simple step by step solution to get you back on track, retard!

Step 1. Self diagnose yourself with paper hands, admitting you have a problem is the first part of finding a fix.

Step 2. Find a specific stock and stick to it. $GME offers a lot of upside with heavily researched DD, but your dumbass thought that about $PLTR and you still managed to fuck it up! Your dumb as hell! That's okay, things will be different this time, or so you tell yourself.

Step 3. Now that you have 200 GME shares, just wait. Literally do nothing. The money is free, and if you do this, not only can you get rid of paper hands, but you can starting to develop your trading prowess through diamond 💎 hands! That's a whole other post, stay tuned.

So you go out Monday, and put your whole $750 account into the stock, and I'll only be asking for a 50% helpers fee off of any of the monstrous gains you collect!

Positions: 4000 $GME shares, $22c 12/31_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Well at least I tried _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Get your BA puts ready _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why $GME can still pop next week Yes yes I know, the big squeeze theory that pervades every game stop post, but there's some real DD behind it (thanks u/rustincoh1e)

$GME is currently trading at $20.15. There are 100M shares outstanding and a short interest of 68M. Momentum slowed down a lot after Tuesday, but the price is holding above $20. These short positions were opened before the RC news, when the price was between $13 - $16. This means that unless the price falls back down below those levels, they'll have to pay a fine, which Is something like 20% + the price of buyback to hold the positions. But seeing as prices have been holding above $20 and news has all been positive since RC increased his stake, I don't see a nearly 50% drop happening soon. That's not to say they'll all cover, there were huge put orders right when the price started dropping, which could mean that institutions are trying to recoup losses through options.

**<h2>BUT</h2>**

Even if 10% of those shares outstanding decided to cover next week, that's an additional 7M shares in demand. Recent volumes have been around 10M per day (not counting big news days). With almost a twice as many shares in demand as usual, we should expect to see some kind of pop. Maybe not a 300% short squeeze like,  but I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $25 next week. 

Am I trying to hype myself up after being down 30% on 12/31 25c I bought at the ATH? You bet your sweet assets I am. Do I think it might actually happen? Maybe if enough of you 💎 ✋ the shit out of this on Monday. 

**tl;dr: hold onto $GME for your God damn lives and we can all get rich. Prove me wrong. 

Seriously, prove me wrong, I'm tryna get better at DD. Constructive criticism only, my hands are diamonds but my feelings are toilet paper.**

EDIT: current shares outstanding is 102M, not 70.

(throw me some ideas of somethign to write in front.. something other than "retard" thanks, unless..). _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀Christmas Miracle / GamerGate 2020: GME shorts negotiating with PE/IBs to unwind their shorts 🚀 I was reading Uberkikz11 twitter (one of the first guys to talk about GME on here / think the Michael J Burry of GamerGate) to get more DD, and then I saw it: https://gfycat.com/anchoredimpishfishingcat-ving-rhames

Some guy tweeted this to Uberkikz11 and nobody is talking about it:

Who is this guy?: I have no fucking idea.

Where did he get it?: I have no idea, hoping someone in the comments can tell us.

What's he saying?: I transcribed part using my shitty OCR app, there may be errors so it's better to read the screenshot but here you go because you're too lazy:

>Right now there are some aggressive negotiations happening behind the scenes between several of the large short positions and some private equity / investment banks (PE/IBs) which will remain unnamed. The chatter going around is that the PE lb syndicate is offering two options. Option 1 is for the shorts to give highly discounted shares they hold of other stocks in exchange for shares of GME stock held by the PE lb side. This will allow the short positions to start to unwind their situation without getting completely destroyed having to source shares from the open market. Option 2 is to allow the large shorts to purchase tranches of GME from $35 to $80 in a private auction that will swap on an ATS and get reported over a series of weeks to minimize price impact. 

>However, things are not progressing well as the discussions have been going on for several months. So, Option 3 is the nuclear option and the reality of it occurring is increasing daily. A few of the head traders have indicated patience is waning and the short squeeze opportunity is just too good to pass up at this point. 

>And this is what brings us to Option 3. Option 3 is for PE/IB to suspend discussions with the shorts and begin accumulation. In fact, large quantities of Calls with strikes from $23 to $35 have been quietly accumulated via small lot buys in all expiry series out to 20 January 2023 and remain as open interest. Next step is analysts initiating new coverage on GameStop discussing how the company is turning things around post-COVID. "Management closed the right stores and properly restructured. The remaining stores can act as micro-distribution centers with GameStop transitioning to a hybrid format e-commerce business. It appears they are taking the best of Amazon (online) and Best Buy (brick & mortar). We see great things ahead for GameStop." This is the narrative that will be launched at the right time to drive retail buying and to trigger passive management ETF buying. Then, PE/lBs will dive in with significant open market purchases to lock the float.

Happy hanukkah retards, to the MOON: https://gfycat.com/blaringfemaleafricanclawedfrog_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME YOLO Christmas update — Dec 25 2020 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let’s get serious about GME Let me preface this post by saying over half of my portfolio is in GME. I believe in the company, and think they could make a comeback within the next year. I understand the whole Xbox and PS5 fiasco will gain them plentiful profits, and they are a main source of games for a lot of people without access to online stores and the like around the globe, but I have some doubts. 

Cohen was a great pump. He raised moral regarding the stock and reinstated a lot of people’s faith in the company. If he were to do a full on hostile takeover this could go really, really well. 

However, there are many alternative situations we could find ourselves in. What if he’s just being an evil cuck and plans to pump and dump this rally? What if he just decides he isn’t into the idea anymore and bails? 

Furthermore, sure GameStops obvious next move is gaming e-commerce, but with Origin, Epic, Steam and more, there are already too many online gaming platforms at this point in my opinion. Perhaps they’ll mean to move into primarily shipping physical copies? Even then, why wouldn’t I simply order a game off Amazon?

Like I said, I’m all for GameStop as a stock, fuck a gay ass bear, and GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 but there may be more that needs to be discussed here. Also, there’s probably some main points I may be missing here regarding this newfound faith in GameStop, so please inform me if I am._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why iRobot $IRBT is Currently Undervalued iRobot is currently a $2.4B company, with a PE of about 15. This is very reasonable, especially given the bubble-like tech environment. IRBT is a company that has experience creating self-driving robotics. Given the PE ratios of other robotics companies (many of which are all R&D) you would expect the PE to be closer to 30.

This post is not necessarily about the fundamentals of IRBT, but more about how it has been left behind in the tech bubble. This is a company that already has cash flow that can be poured into future robot R&D. 

A reasonable price target for the next 1 year is $120-$150, this would put it back in line with the rest of the industry.

As an options play, IV is also relatively low. One could buy the Jan 2022 $130C and simply make money if/when IV rises, even without a significant rise in price.

# Ghosts of Christmas Past

**Chapter 1: Crypto (2017-18)**

How it all started... I threw every last dollar I had in ETH at $12 and swing traded a ton of shit coins and ICOs until it all came crashing down.

In short: turned $8K into $300K and back to $30k but owed the IRS \~$120K since all the gains were calculated at 2017-year-end. I royally fucked myself because I didn't set any money aside for taxes. Ended up in debt to some very bad people and things were very dark, I don't like to talk about this time in my life that much.

**Chapter 2: WSB Tuition (2018)**

First learned about WSB in 2018 from the infamous FB [ER put play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/922gtp/facebooks_put_play_from_yesterday_im_20_time_to/) by /u/YungBillionaire turning \~$28K into $451K overnight. That sounded fun.

Quickly learned about options but most importantly about FDs, tendies, and the power of memes.

Back then it was all about trade wars and hanging at the whim of commander cheeto's supple tweets.

I have fond memories of:

* Apparently the first stock I ever bought on Robinhood was [HMNY](https://imgur.com/a/2AsrVQB)... thanks Robinhood Recap for the reminder of my retarded-ness
* Grew my first set of winkles on my smooth brain with AMC calls. The thesis was that their Stubs A-List subscription was doing pretty well according to /r/AMCsAList back then
* Went all-in MTCH weekly puts with $12K clenching my stomach in the fetal position when all of a sudden there was a [lawsuit](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2018/08/14/match-group-faces-2b-lawsuit-from-tinder-co.html) and I tripled my account in minutes, pure luck

Still ended up losing $30K and swore off options forever... until 2020 where I lost another $10k in options. Fucking weeklies man, they're like if cocaine and blackjack made a dopamine-infused baby

[WTF is up with the snowflakes Robinhood? So gay, instant short when it IPOs](https://preview.redd.it/cm95k7f43c761.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=806ab5dc60f841ab326aec4ae3f5f39ee8312847)

# Ghosts of Christmas Present

**Chapter 3: Road to $1M+ (2020)**

Let's start with the receipts since that's what everyone's interested in:

[Proof that I started Feb 2020 with only $35K](https://preview.redd.it/u17ezkgm5i761.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=c43b917b12aed8a84b30a43f329020b5def45e39)

Vanguard is my 401k provider and their self-directed brokerage is provided by TD Ameritrade which is why you see screenshots from two different apps. Started the year with $11K in 401k, deposited $26K more in Jan and then started trading in Feb with $35K. The $49K withdrawal in June was for a 401k loan to buy a Tesla.

[Looking at this all-time graph gets me so hard](https://preview.redd.it/vufh3f4b3c761.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f708f141f1c9177f212aa271e443eab5be3fd18)

In my first run up to June, turned $35k into $850K (APT, CODX, NCLH, CHWY) and decided my luck was too good and needed to "cool down". Decided to withdraw $50k for a Tesla and stayed away from the markets for a good 3 months thinking the market was going to go back down again...

But it didn't, the market kept rallying and I got the tendie tingles. My first move in Sept was to go all-in on WORK and bought at the high of $35 and was immediately down -30% thanks to their shit ER. They recovered a bit in the weeks afterwards and then jumped into CRSR which made me a millionaire and then GME. GME also shit the bed with a -20% ER but recovered swiftly thanks to Lord Cohen and recently jumped into STIC for that final spike up.

**Chapter 4: Explaining every trade**

[Proof of every gain\/loss I've ever traded \(except APT history which was in Vanguard\)](https://preview.redd.it/mheen4rd3c761.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=504af2cd40b63d276fb42bb83c11bc85c6c1e18f)

My strategy is going all-in on a single stock all-shares. The idea is to have a thesis and conviction with that trade. I stay in the trade until the thesis is invalidated or another opportunity arises, it's a simple strategy and it's worked for me so far. My account does not allow options or margin trading.

Here's a few theses and history I remember in hopes folks can learn something:

* **APT/CODX** \- It was obvious to me in Jan/Feb that this coronavirus was the real deal. The trick was to look at the facts and not the noise. There was a fake [viral video](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fact-check-are-these-wuhan-residents-screaming-and-begging-for-their-lives/articleshow/74062839.cms) of blood-curdling screams from Wuhan apartments that was so obviously fake but western media loved it. On the other hand, Wuhan built a makeshift hospital in just [10 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sh7hghljuQ), that's real action the government took and showed me how seriously dangerous this new virus was going to be. So I loaded up on APT, a mask stock, and rode it up and then switched to CODX, a testing stock, and rode that up from $11 to $24 selling right before their botched ER (conf call with no queue and everyone talking over each other lol)
* **NCLH** \- Saw a curious spike in volume on May 14 with a move upward, piqued my tendie tingles again. Decided it was worth an all-in at $10.57 as the support of $10 was pretty strong. The mood at the time was that coronavirus was waning (I knew it was wrong but the market was emotionally optimistic) and fortunately it caused NCLH to moon and I sold at $19.75 on June 4 even though it kept mooning to $26 over the next 2 days
* **CHWY** \- Got a dog, it's cute. Pets + E-Commerce during a pandemic, easy money. Bought at $41 and sold at $46 only because I thought it was moving kind of slowly. Well I was pretty wrong, now it's at $104
* **SQQQ/TVIX** \- I tried being a gay bear for an hour and lost money. Don't ever be a gay bear
* **CRSR** \- Been watching a ton of tech review and PC building YouTube channels and subreddits and the "enthusiast" crowd is definitely larger and has bigger wallets than people think. There is fucking [keyboard typing ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6gW18XE6EM) now and ebay reviewers THANKING scalpers for charging them 2-3x MRSP. Biggest generational jump in GPU and CPU in a while and recently IPO-ed Corsair was definitely gonna benefit from this new generation of gamers was my thesis. Went all-in at $24 and sold at $36 after a non-stop run even though it kept running all the way to $51. No regrets, profit is profit.
* **WORK** \- It was the only "WFH" stock that didn't moon yet, thought it deserved a chance was my thesis. Went all-in at the tippy top of $35 on Sept 2 and it immediately kept crashing all the way to $24 in 5 days. Fortunately it recovered a bit and sold at $32 for a loss since I gave up hope and it seemed to be running out of steam

**Chapter 5: GME Gang Confession**

Now: I have a confession to make. My conviction for the Gamestop MOASS is insane. Had 88,233 shares at $13.04 buy-in with a $120 stop limit. Listening to this [90-min podcast](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) of /u/Uberkikz11 going on about how he knows more about this company than any mortal human should gets me so friken hard every time.

But. That -20% ER drop hurt me on a spiritual level. Watching my account go from $1.5M to $1.1M at one point gave me Taco Bell-levels of stomach cramps.

So when it bounced back to $15-16 on no news on Fri, Dec 18, I felt like I needed to "cool down" again. It was going into the holidays with a British virus mutation on the way and hedge funds [manipulating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI) to get their holiday bonuses, it felt kind of dangerous. And no way Ryan Cohen would be working with his lawyers on something that fast over the holidays, right?

So I sold all my GME at $15.50.

Then on Mon, Dec 21 morning, Lord Cohen drops his new 13D/A... but the stock price stayed flat all day. The Lord gave me a chance. A whole day to get back in. Unfortunately I didn't take it.

And then Tue, Dec 22 all tendies broke loose, the squeezening. +25% gain. /u/deepfuckingvalue dropping his massive dong in another update. I waddled back and forth in my fetal position. Missed out on \~$300K gain while watching everyone freak out. Felt exactly like this:

[Can't feel my dick at all...](https://preview.redd.it/gn74i1yg3c761.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c1a7031f8528f949a6d409f045ca727298e7312)

**Chapter 6: Barking on a STIC**

While waddling and scrolling on my phone, I happened to stumble across [this post](https://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kih8z3/the_next_meme_hot_pick_for_all_the_good_boy/) about STIC and BarkBox. Not sure why /u/pound_salt_ deleted the original post but at the time, it was the only post about it on WSB

I was pretty familiar with BarkBox and started researching, it seemed super un-discovered. I liked what I saw: Pets. E-commerce. Subscription. SPAC. Basic white bitches spoiling dogs. This might be worth an all-in.

So on Wed, Dec 23 morning I decided to make a move. All-in at $14.42.

Then I started writing everything I had learned and posted it all in my DD post at 1:46PM ET because I thought it was worth sharing what I found [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiypqq/sir\_jack\_a\_lots\_next\_move\_all\_in\_stic\_bark\_merger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiypqq/sir_jack_a_lots_next_move_all_in_stic_bark_merger/)

The price was $14.25 at the time of posting and frankly, price was oddly flat at $14.25 pretty much all day. Lots of people got to buy in at this price. Why did it take me so long to write it? I had actual work meetings all morning and wrote it during my lunch break

Then by the luck of the gods, apparently the CEO of BarkBox, Matt Meeker, went onto [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/23/bark-to-go-public.html) at 3:20PM ET and it started mooning. On Thurs, Dec 24 I awoke to a 20% pop and shared my gains for ya'll to salivate over. Complete. Luck.

# Ghost of Christmas Future

**Chapter 7: What's next?**

Let me be clear. I stand by every word of conviction I mentioned in all my GME and STIC posts, those are still my favorite H1 2021 plays. Holding STIC until merger would most definitely get you some massive gains.

But I'm a swing momentum trader. If I feel like something is running out of steam, has a risk of a rug pull, or another stock has potential to pick up steam with lesser downside, that's when I usually jump around.

I'm not happy with just a +25% in 3 months. I want a +25% compounded on +25% compounded on another +25% in the same 3 month time period.

On Monday, Dec 28 I will probably sell STIC and move all into CRSR again. From technical charting perspective, I'm loving the setup and the [magical crayons](https://imgur.com/a/PxlN2em) are telling me we're at the support again and this should bounce in anticipation of strong Q4 earnings.

Now: this is not a ding on STIC or GME, I stand by my 2x-10x claims at some point in H1 2021. It will eventually get there but it might also dip and rise again and I want to swing that dip and rise.

Let me spell it out for some retards: because STIC moon-ed so fast, I want to sell to capture profits and hopefully buy back in on a dip. If STIC had not mooned yet, I would still be holding STIC for a more gradual moon-ing to let my thesis play out. If STIC does not dip but keeps mooning, then I will not chase and happily watch other diamond hands enjoy their tendies.

# Q&A / AMAA

I'm fucking tired of answering the same repeated idiotic questions. Let this Q&A serve as an artifact and please link it to new retards. I will also proceed to debunk every single fucking false claim I've read in my last few posts. Also feel free to AMAA in the comments, I'll be replying all day.

1. **How often do you jack off?** At least 2 times a day and always before I make a trade for that post-nut clarity
2. **Haha you're going to owe so much in taxes** \- Nope, this is all in my 401k which in the US means I don't owe taxes until I withdraw. Fucking compounding gains for years bitch
3. **Why are you making such risky trades?** My goal is 8 digits or bust, that's my /r/fatfire number so I can finally quit this wageslave game. It's so obviously stacked against us and requires a lottery moment to reach escape velocity to play on New Game+ where I can live on $400k 4% SWR on $10M. This is my lottery moment and I'm leaning all the fucking way in. That's why I'm chad-ing it up and trying to TIME the market, meaning riding shit up and then jumping back into shit for another ride up. Fuck you Warren Buffet and your 90 y/o "time in the market" boomer bullshit. The next pandemic in 2025 might wipe us all out anyways, I ain't got time to wait for retirement. Gotta will it into existence. YOLO
4. **How are you so good at this?** I study everything. Technicals. Charts. Support levels. Volume spikes. Short interest. Executive teams. Rumors. Customer sentiment. Employee morale. Insider trading. MSM manipulation. Comparable market caps. ER reports. Upgrade reports. SEC filings. Meme potential. I literally watch and study every facet I can about a company, and do so quickly.
5. **What's your trading strategy?** All-in on a single stock all-shares. The idea is to have a thesis and conviction with that trade. I stay in the trade until the thesis is invalidated or another opportunity arises, it's a simple strategy and it's worked for me so far.
6. **Why do you post on WSB?** Internet points is fucking fun. I was banned for like 30 minutes  yesterday (on "accident" apparently) and having $200k+ gains without the ability to share was just not the same
7. **How do I follow your next move?** Oh just follow my discord/newslett -- no fuck that shit. I don't do discord or newsletters or twitter or anything else. I'll keep posting on WSB until 8 digits or bust (or ban), you can guarantee that.
8. **Why do you remove the time on your screenshots?** I'm cropping shit on my iPhone and my username is between the portfolio number and the top bar. Otherwise I'd love to friken show off my perpetual 69% battery level
9. **15% isn't a real YOLO** \- I am literally shoving my entire net worth into a single stock every single time. Correct it's not the same as blackjack or FDs where if I got it wrong, I could lose everything but it's still fucking riskier than any ETF or financial advisor with their cuckold MBA would ever advise. One 15% play may not be impressive but compounded together is how you get this 50X in less than a year
10. **Where's PLTR or TSLA?** Notice I never once touched PLTR, TSLA, NIO, XBEV, MVIS, etc or any of the other meme stocks WSB loves. That's because I hate being a sheep and following after the curve. I try to find shit *right* before the curve starts (usually indicated by a volume spike) and most WSB meme stocks are up way too high for my risk tolerance. Too much at stake to lose to a random rug pull moment.
11. **Hey I think I'm your cousin, can I get some money?** No you fuck, [stop being poor](https://i.redd.it/eyj4re61ibe21.jpg).
12. **Hey do you wanna fuck my ex-wife?** Already did, next
13. **You're just using WSB to pump and dump on us** \- No you fucking idiot.

* **First:** look at my [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/posts/), I NEVER make a hard recommendation for people to buy a stock. I only share my gains, losses, or DD because it's fucking funny to see how ya'll react. Whether people want to follow my move or not is 100% up to people. Do your own fucking DD and figure out when you want to sell according to your own thesis/risk tolerance.
* **Second**: You folks keep asking me for my next move. Well how and when the fuck should I share it? If I post something in the morning, it's stuck in /new for a while until it gets enough upvotes to hit the front page and by then it's already afternoon or market close and the stock might have already done who knows what. That's not pump and dumping, that's just a delayed effect of how Reddit's algorithm works. Anything on the front page is essentially 5-15 hours old news and you need to determine if the state of the world is still the same or be a sheep and chase. It's the same thing once you hear Aunt Cathie or Boomer Cramer mention a stock and it trickles down to you, you're chasing after others have already gotten in
* **Third:** My $1.5M is not enough to move any real-volume stock. I don't touch OTC or low-volume shit. For STIC: I have 97K shares and on average 2-4M shares are traded every day for STIC so my account is a like a drop of whale cum in the ocean
* **Fourth:** Real pump and dumpers are the shitty scum on the earth. Spend any time in /r/pennystocks or some Discord or Stocktwits and holy shit, these scum run fucking operations. I've even seen paid newsletters where the highest tier gets the tip "early" to buy in and then the lower/free tiers get the tip which causes the pump for the early buyers to literally dump on and create bag holders on non-existant volume too
* **Fifth:** Listen to what /u/DoubleKillGG and his big brain figured out the rest of you retards could not:

>The fact is that SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT is a swing trader. Yes he pumps his stocks and closes relatively quickly but he doesn't pump shit stocks. If you bought any of his positions when he posted you'd be up on everything. A pump and dump requires the dump part where investors are left holding a stock that is worth less than when they bought it. He did, however, break wsb's rule #4; STIC's market cap is below $1B.

With the Fed keeping rates low for the foreseeable future, mortgage lenders are poised for further growth.

Quicken Loans - a subsidiary of Rocket Mortgages (RKT) - was the first mortgage lender to go public and capitalize on the low mortgage rate environment. Following suite, United Wholesale Mortgage is going public via SPAC in a merge with G-H-I-V. 

WHAT IS IT?:

Only the largest SPAC deal EVER at a value of $16.1 Billion.

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) is the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the US and the second largest mortgage lender next to RKT. 

SHOULD I BUY IT?:

In the most recent Quarter (Q3), UWM raked in $1.45B net income. They had 81% year-over-year increase in loan volume, at $54.2B. Per CEO Mat Ishbia on Q3: "This is our best quarter in the company’s 34 years, showing that borrowers are recognizing that independent mortgage brokers offer better rates, greater speed and deeper experience."

G-H-I-V currently has over 50% institutional ownership, meaning the big fish are interested. With REITs failing, independent mortgage lending companies have become a new way of capitalizing on the real estate market. More of these companies will be going public in the months to come.

UWM is the first one to IPO via SPAC. RKT priced their IPO at $18 back in August, and they have a much larger market cap.

RKT Market Cap:  41B (2B shares).

G-H-I-V Market Cap: 677M (53M shares).

RKT may have larger market share, but as the second largest contender and due to the vast scale comparison in market cap, I think it's fair to say that G-H-I-V should at least be trading at a higher price than RKT. One of the biggest things keeping RKTs share price down is its bigness. With large institutional ownership parking money like they would in REITs, it makes it difficult for retail investors to move the stock price. With a market cap magnitudes smaller, G-H-I-V has the potential to moon the way RKT has failed to.

WHEN?:

The Special Meeting for approval is happening January 20th at 6am PST. The new ticker will be UWMC. At the current price of $13/share, I believe the upside potential far outweighs the downside. I'm placing my conservative low end PT at $20, but I see G-H-I-V flying much higher than RKT.

TLDR: 

Buy G-H-I-V for the same reason you bought RKT. G-H-I-V will moon the way you hoped RKT would. Buy before the January 20th meeting for max tendies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 4K upvotes for a $3 gain... what has this sub become? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My portfolio _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Asked WSB the best Covid plays in JANUARY, and you guys let me down! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Macrovision. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The day of GME short squeeze You wake up at 7AM in morning, you begin your day with a bowl of cereal made by $K, you go on chrome on your $GOOG smartphone, and right away it auto-fills [https://www.investing.com/equities/gamestop-corp](https://www.investing.com/equities/gamestop-corp) because Sundar Pichai knows you check that page every 5 seconds. It's still premarket, you know it doesn't mean shit most of the time but you do it every day anyway. Once again it's a -0.5% day.  You notice a hit piece from SeekingAlpha written by Mott Capital, you don't know what it's saying since you can't read, but somehow you know the author is a gay bear. Then you go on StockTwits, ShyGlizzy is "shorting here" again but you know learned to ignore all the bears. You hide your feeling of discomfort for now.

It's now been 3 days since you bought GME 40C, and every day you keep losing to theta gang. You bought at 300% IV and there's 2 days until expiration. You're staring at a 95% loss, and you're about to paperhand, but you don't because you know u/deepfuckingvalue is still fucking in at a gain of over 9 million. You unzip your pants and start jerking off to his gain porn. You start at 7:28 and finish just in time before the market opens.

Robinhood crashes again and you can't log in, you start feeling a sense of panic rising through the depth of your innards. You take a double dose of Prozac and Xanax and from $PFE, you asked your doctor for this since you also have $PFE 60c expiring in 2 weeks. But it's not helping and you feel your hands turn into toilet paper.

But wait... what's going on ? $GME on investing.com is showing a price of $42.69?!?!? You think you're dreaming so you refresh... now it's $69... another 5 minutes... no updates. You go on r/wallstreetbets and you see the daily thread comment has over 30k comments. GME triggered circuit breaker and its stopped trading, and it's now mooning 100% every time it resumes trading

You notice your PP fully erect at over 3 inches, you haven't felt this way since you have ED from all the Prozac you've been taking ever since you started options trading. $GME is now over $9000 dollars per share, u/deepfuckingvalue is now banging McKenzie Scott (formerly known as McKenzie Bezos) and starts a hostile take over of $AMZN. While u/Sir_jack_a_lot  dies from a ruptured brain aneurysm due to hypertension from too many tendies.  The WSB collective now starts a hedge fund, creating $RTRD ETF comprised solely of GME and TSLA calls. Bears around the world are annihilated while shares of $KMB and $JNJ rallies over 30% on reports of a sudden increase in demand for kleenex and personal lubricants.

and that was the greatest day of your life, and it's great because you didn't paperhand.

What happened ***during*** earnings last year?

First off, let's see what happened last year during earnings. See bolded areas.

>KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Cerner Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s5ctDogkuwLExiVu-xZ7z8m2mEanLnaHTtywdjDtpXqzSZRyADEleNSuzs1xAD01GiCtkmknLn5b2EDhuKdlqw==) (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year that ended December 28, 2019.  
Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $1.442 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to $1.366 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, and ***in line*** ***with the Company’s expectations***.  Full-year 2019 revenue was $5.693 billion, up 6 percent compared to 2018 revenue of $5.366 billion.  
Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2019 ***were above the Company’s expectations*** at $1.665 billion.  Full-year 2019 bookings were $5.990 billion compared to 2018 bookings of $6.721 billion.  The decline in bookings was primarily driven by the Company being more selective in the types of contracts it pursues, which led to fewer large, long-term outsourcing contracts.  
...  
Adjusted Net Earnings for fourth quarter 2019 were $237.2 million, compared to $208.1 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2019, ***in line with the Company’s expectations*** and up 19 percent compared to $0.63 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in the year-ago quarter. 

Everything was mellow and nothing was a huge shocker (this is good). Cool, everything checks out. Investors got what they were told. Here's what Marc had to say regarding adjusted operating margin (*this is important*).

What happened ***the following weeks/months after*** earnings last year?

Insiders dumped the stock and Starboard off-loaded a small stake initially and gradually. I posted about the insider selling [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/g3sqv8/cerner_insider_sales_vs_cerner_stock_price/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but I'll add more color below. Look at how much stocks they sold. These guys have been around for 15+ years and if its at a good enough price (to sell) for them, its at a good enough price for me. Starboard has off loaded about a quarter of their initial investment by 9/2020. This is an activist hedge fund. They don't give a shit about prospects beyond five years. They've called out Olive Garden's [breadsticks strategy](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/04/olive-garden-breadsticks-starboard) and once the stock price reach adequate levels they sell. Jeff and starboard doesn't give a shit about Cerner's progress on patient safety, enabling true interop, helping vets. They care about the business model and **ultimately** the stock price. Certain respectable hedgefunds that are [long only](https://www.ft.com/content/1a72e04c-54a7-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1) but starboard **is certainly not** one of them.

About the adjusted operating margin targets.

This goal/commitment was made by Jeff Smith. As an activist investor, he goes into a position/stake and tells management what to do and agitates for a change. Please watch this video [https://youtu.be/uJs1I-Q4hd0?t=551](https://youtu.be/uJs1I-Q4hd0?t=551) and see how much he talks about margin targets as his main objective for the investment.

How does marc achieve this? Expensing alot of shit into one bucket called 'Organizational restructuring and other expense' and calling it an 'adjustment'. The SEC doesn't really care about the non-GAAP (aka non-accounting standards) so Cerner is free to bucket this expense into one line item and leave it vague. Some call this financial engineering or creative accounting. Whatever you call it, this is legal. (GAAP items, on the other hand, have strict guidelines and examples published by the FASB and adopted by the SEC). So as long as Marc is keenly aware of the numerator and denominator to get the margin percent, he can adjust and add/subtract to this 'organizational restructuring and other expense' line item and make it to 22.5%. It comes down to a simple math formula, and its not that difficult to move random shit within that line item.

https://preview.redd.it/gumnftoxm8761.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff1cf9a68f752bc741824a4073b3c43c744b3066

Going back to Jeff from Starboard. Jeff is intimately aware of Cerner's progress through two avenues. One is through board of directors. Jeff gave Brent some 'choices' for appointing four new directors but really the candidate pools were full of Jeff's homies that would advocate on his behalf. So when Brent 'chose' George, Halsey, and two other randos, they are largely considered agents for Jeff and Starboard. How do I know they are homies? they both worked together with Jeff closely before. These are two examples found online.

&#x200B;

Also, Jeff made Cerner hire a turnaround consulting company called Alix Partners. The approx. 20 consultants actually doing the grunt work are currently under 'contractor' status at Cerner and have their own Cerner contractor emails. They report to Kimberly Gerard who is the chief transformation officer at Cerner. So the managing director at Alix Partners has weekly/monthly syncs with Kimberly and has a good pulse of the process. This MD is likely talking to Jeff about the progress through some back channel communication, 110% guarantee.

Here is my prediction for the upcoming earnings.

1. Cerner will meet or exceed most financial metrics/guidance set forth by mgmt during earnings.
2. Cerner will exceed the 22.5% adjusted operating margin for 4Q2020.
3. Cerner will provide some vanilla/generic/maybe-slightly-positive guidance for CY2021. They won't dive deep into it at the earnings because the investor community meeting at HIMSS 2021 will cover that. (btw guidance is a big component of wall street reaction and mgmt knows this so they won't make any major/"draconian" (marc's words) guidance)
4. After-hours and the day after, Cerner stock price will react positively. (If I had to guess: 4+% change)
5. Just like before, in the coming days/weeks/months insiders like Don Trigg / Randy Sims (/other insiders who follow Cerner stock on a daily basis for decades) will file form 4 with the SEC and starboard will file form 13F (which is filed on a quarterly basis) with the SEC showing that they fucking **dumped** Cerner shares.

Between step 4 and 5, I will evaluate my hypothesis and see if it tracks along. If I sense that it is, I am dumping my aspp and 401k cerner shares. 100% of all available/tradable shares. I won't say exactly how much but its in the four digits. I don't give a shit about 15% discount on aspp or .18/quarter dividends. If I really cared about a steady income stream I'd buy SPHD or QYLD that pays monthly.

Let the risks be known. This earnings beat might already be priced in and there might not be much reaction. After all, is the second major hurdle and analyst might already expect cerner to beat it as easily as it did on the first margin goal. If CFO succession plan is still not in place, this might leave some analysts hanging regarding forward guidance philosophy. (let me digress for a bit: Hey Brent, I know you're looking for the next CFO so while you're at it, ask the headhunters to look for a dope COO too... it's been quite a while if you haven't noticed. Fuck a Chief Strategy Officer, largely a symbolic figurehead). Another one could be vague/largely-open-ended forward guidance for 2021 presented during the earnings from covid or something. Also, know that once you sell, you won't be able to vote using the shares (not that retail investor votes ever mattered).

Lastly, I'm not the only one who is 'playing' earnings for Cerner. See options below.

All Chinese tech companies have been engaged in anticompetitive practices for twenty years.

This is an open and shut case. 

Similarly, the blocked ANT IPO was reasonable because they were creating a Chinese version of the 2008 financial crisis with their overleveraged loan business.

Twas the night before Christmas,  
and all on the floor,  
not a trader was trading,  
not a screen was a'glow.  


The stocks that I purchased,  
were in my brokerage, astray.   
In hopes that a good trade,  
soon would make gainz.  


In my penthouse apartment,  
on Fulton and John,   
I was laying with hos,  
who had nothing on.  


When outside my window,  
I heard a great sound!  
I prayed those SEC dicks,  
were nowhere to be found.  


I sprang from my bed,  
grabbed my gun, and walked slow,  
to see what was up.  
(This pissed off my ho).  


I could scarcely believe,  
what my eyes were seeing!  
It was a huge space yacht!  
I thought, "I must be dreaming!"  


"I've always wanted one,  
to piss off my haters!  
And look!," I said,  
"It's pulled by eight traders!"  


Two teams of four traders,  
pulled the yacht through the sky.  
Then I noticed the driver,  
with a twinkle in his eye.  


His eyes were glazed over,  
his legs shook like jelly,  
and his 5 o'clock shadow,  
told me, it's Martin Shkreli!  


The yacht stopped at my penthouse,  
it was facing the train.  
St. Martin stood up,  
and called his traders by name.  


"On Madoff! On Friehling!  
On Lay and Skilling!  
On Belfort! On Fuld!  
On Lippmann and Keating!"  


"Pull to the window,  
I see and good boy,  
who's made the nice list!  
Let's give him some toys!"  


When under my tree,  
more presents appeared!  
My stocking was full!  
My hos shook in fear.  


I looked in his bag,  
and asked, "What's the coal for?"  
"That's for Loretta Lynch," he said,  
"And Eric Holder."  


"But you're a good trader,  
your gains my be slight,  
but you're yoloing the market,  
so I visit tonight."  


"Christmas is about giving,  
about joy, love, and cheer,  
so fuck the SEC!  
And keep trading! Don't fear!"  


His yacht pulled away,  
my hos, they returned,  
but St. Martin was gone.  
He was not to be heard.  


But I heard him exclaim,  
as his yacht shone in the snow,  
"Happy Christmas to all,  
And to all a #YOLO

What should I yolo the last of my 2k into _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sector DD: AI, Robotics, Genomics, Digital Payments, Cloud Computing, and Batteries Macro Trends will make you rich (aka why ARK holdings are not just memes) I am so fucking bullish on a number of disruptive technologies (many of which I share with Cathie) and I have been for years. I'm bored at a xmas party so just throwing this out there off the top of my head for all you retards considering hopping on the ARK train. Here is a quick and dirty rundown on why I'm hyper-bullish in these sectors:

**- AI (and robotics):** if you thought the interwebs revolutionized the world by creating new massive industries like e-commerce and social media, wait til AI starts getting involved in a seriously major way. It's in its infancy still as a technology but think about the impact to autonomous driving/ridesharing taxi networks and shipping, traffic engineering and city planning, healthcare, military applications, roboinvesting, manufacturing, precise operations like controlling a spacecraft, advanced chemistry, literally anything that requires predictive analytics or in-depth parsing of huge data sets that a human simply could never do.

Human error and psychological bias are enormous contributors to loss of revenue and life. In 20 or 30 years, any office worker who pushes paperwork or does other menial work could be obsolete if their company can afford an AI software suite that can process that tasking at 10 or 20 or 100 times the speed with essentially zero errors.

Robotics will give AI suites and other software-based decision-making entities the ability to perform physical work. They can keep human operators outside of dangerous or difficult situations. Major manufacturing companies are buying into robotics hard for their production lines.

I like teradyne for robotics and C3 for AI. I am looking for more tickers to buy on both.

**- Precision/Personalized Medicine (Telemed, but largely Genomics):**

Telemedicine and small partially automated clinics will eliminate the need to see a primary care physician or psychiatrist for something as minor as a check up, flu shot, or strep throat swab. Decentralization of healthcare is already a worldwide trend.

Genetic sequencing is the big one. Genome sequencing cost for the first human genome cost $2.7B and 13 years. It is now approaching $1000 - technologies like this are finally at the point where they are ready to go to market and not just R&D pipe dreams. Companies like 23&Me are first movers in bringing personalized genetics to the public. Imagine if you could have a service like that flag the fact that you're likely to develop breast cancer and catch it at stage one? Imagine if it could tell you what kind of beer you're most likely to enjoy? Imagine if you could edit a chronic illness out of your unborn child. There are obviously regulatory and ethical implications here but that won't stop the industry from growing.

I am so fucking bullish on CRSP long-term despite this run up. We are already at a stage where research firms are targeting monogenic diseases (only one gene mutated, easier to fix). CRSP, EDIT and NTLA are the only three companies with patents filed for CRISPR gene editing technology. Buy. The opportunity is so much greater than the premium you think you might be paying to buy this high.

\- **Digital Payments:** Cash payments are at an all-time low in global history yet there is still plenty of room for cash payments to transition to digital. Companies like venmo and square are now up-ending the finance industry by controlling digital cash flow more than traditional banking institutions you are. Answer me this: when was the last time you went to the bank in person to withdraw cash for your daily expenses? For me it was probably 2012. There are entire markets in Africa where people are only just starting to use SMS money-gram type mobile payment things. Mobile payments will rule the world of transactions soon.

P o o p c o i n is extremely controversial right now but at the very least, it is an indicator that **institutional** interest in digital payments and mobile value transfer is strong and growing. You might also consider it more of an asset/store of value than a medium for value exchange, but either way. Adoption is increasing. Access is increasing. Awareness is increasing. Faith in fiat currencies is decreasing (consider Venezuela. lol. and the USD fears recently). These are all bull signals.

Fintech is one of my strongest conviction buys. SQ, PYPL

**- Batteries - Energy storage:**

The global developed economy runs on the combustion engine / fossil fuel power plant. Forget about activism and ESG funds for a second and think about this: *when do new services or technologies get adapted over existing ones that serve a similar function?*

Answer: *when they become cheaper than the status quo solutions.* Battery technology research drive is insane right now as we've seen by the hype around EV and charging tech companies. Batteries are the primary cost driver of an electric vehicle - it's like more than half of the cost of the input material. Once battery prices cross a tipping point and electric vehicles become cheaper than gasoline cars, there will be a mass exodus to EVs. EVs have less moving parts than a gasoline car so they require less maintenance, and they have greater power efficiency too. This may have become a little bit of a bubble recently, but I honestly am so bullish on the long term case I don't care. Ride out pumps and dumps and stay invested in your thesis. Long-term energy storage is also critical for distributed energy networks (imagine people are generating solar at home, banking it, and then using it at night or selling it back to the grid when prices are highest intraday)

TSLA here. not sure what else to add yet. everything else seems pump and dumpy but I am in battery metal mining ETFs hard.

\- **3D printing:**

Industrial 3d printing is huge. Aerospace and medical devices are the best use cases here.

**- Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity:**

These are critical infrastructure systems needed to create a functional ecosystem for things like AI, robotics, etc, but there are other drives besides. the amount of data collection and analytics worldwide is ATH and will only go up. and people love their smart homes and devices lol. IoT makes technology an environment and not just a device. And cybersecurity is a very necessary thing in a world where everything is increasingly digital and putin is an asshole

Welp that's all folks. thanks for reading and time to crack another beer_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeing a lot more red than green for Christmas 💵 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cybertruck fund, already ordered, only playing TSLA with this account now. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The boomer pessimist long term potential of GME I spent some time doing some more DD on GME and visionary thinking and I don’t believe fundamentally it has a way forward without making a hardcore right turn steam like video game console platform

I was invested in GME and I sold off at about 20$ just to ride the train and I was considering dumping a few K in it but upon considering it a potential short term gain, I can't see the long term future for gamestop (and the stock market is future looking.... as you see with these insane EV plays).
First some points to consider - I'm not going to explain them all because you are all intelligent enough:

-PC Gaming (how did this evolve) 
-DVD/Blu Ray Sales (growth trends) 
-XBox Game Pass 
-Stadia 
-Mobile Gaming 
-Current Trends in YoY Physical/Digital Video Game Trends
 -Cheaper Storage on devices (SSD, external drives etc...) 
-Better Internet Service (starlink, fibre installations etc...) 
-Facebook Marketplace/Kijiji/Craigslist -The Giants (Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart etc....) 
-Chewy selling undigitiseable goods 
-Ryan Cohen is a one hit wonder? 
-Blockbuster 
-HMV

The Short Squeeze Theory 
If any catalyst was the short squeeze, its RC's increased position in GME. That generated 30% gains. If a 30% gain is not enough to trigger a short squeeze, then what is? This is the second 30% gain recently - I guess the Oct 8, Microsoft announcement was the first. 

How does Gamestop have a rosy future, 
where is its niche? 

The only thing I can thing of that would be an epic play would be drone video game delivery. They have so many locations they can have a video game delivered by drone . A combination of super fast video game delivery and making a central video game console system à la steam is the only real way forward. Everything else is a distraction. Drones, Boardgames and video games hardware accessories might have a spot, however this would take a very motivated workforce.

I'm not saying its not undervalued even today and could be even a win short term but all signs and historical examples point to decline._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Historical Short squeezes and some references That did and did not happen
Revlon (Perlman owner the majority of company and it never happened)
BITA (went bankrupt, not sure it happened )
Tesla (aided by registered shareholders I guess)
Volkswagen (totally manufactured by Porsche)
Kalbios (manufactured by Shrek)

Thought it would be useful, looking at the various historical comparisons 

One thing I felt was that though the short squeeze is possible, it takes a particularly daring maneuver by a motivated individual to make it happen or a HUGE catalyst. Ryan Cohen doesn’t seem to be the type of guy to do it, could be wrong._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How you retards are gonna react when you get your stimulus _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NYT: Robinhood’s 2020 Recaps Are a Meme for a Volatile Year _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ More SolarWinds hate...time to pick up more FEYE _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In honor of Cramer’s latest tweet.
