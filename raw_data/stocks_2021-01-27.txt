Just looking for some insight or guidance on where to being with research into playing the stock market, any suggested literature? Anything that is a MUST know? I am starting to look into making my money work for me, and don’t know where or how to start exactly! A lot of my other associates play the stock market, and tell me I should as well. Please only positive or helpful feedback. 
Thanks in advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Margin Account Question So I just opened my first margin account with Webull. Am I correct in assuming that as long as only buy with the cash I put in and not on margin that my account would function just the same as a cash account? Obviously not including pattern day trading rules._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Day trading & PDT flag I have a TDA margin account with $100k+ and am a little uncertain of all the rules surrounding Pattern Day Traders.  With all the volatility that's been going on, I don't want to put my account at risk.  Since I have over $25k, can I make as many round-trip day trades as I want, or does TDA need to switch my account to a day trader account (if it isn't already?)  

Thanks for helping me to understand,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New warning from TD Ameritrade on volatile stocks after logging in I just logged back into TDA and noticed this warning was very recently posted. Before it was posted, I was able to get into GameS at 300 and out at 340. It seems to be pretty generic; "Several restrictions on some transactions"  I did not see it there earlier today.

Does anybody know what this means, specifically?

"**Security impacts related to market conditions:**

In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GM E, $A MC and other securities. We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors."  

Update:  

Since Monday, I've been trying to short 1 share of G ME just to see if TD would allow it.  I have not been able to, which makes me wonder if they are in bed with somebody else and giving them preferential treatment.  I was able to buy a small amount of shares at the end of the day so I could gamble.  I plan on holding all day Thursday and see if anything ends up coming with the Friday/Monday potential squeeze.  

Also, I never really read anything else about what TD was doing to 'put restrictions on some transactions.'  Some of the comments below indicate platforms being down and trades not filling properly, but I think that is somewhat common with any type of stock when volume explodes.  And the regular indices were down 2-2.5% today, further stressing brokerages.  Some transparency from TD would've been nice, rather than a cryptic post.  They also updated the warning later on to remove the ticker symbols.  Thanks to all who contributed to this post; I didn't expect to have \~100 comments!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What would happen in an extended halt? Just want to preface this by saying I'm not trying to incite FDU or spread misinformation.

However, everyone in this subreddit is saying to hold PLTR and don’t sell. But everywhere I’ve researched, analysts say to sell and predict the value will go down.

Why does reddit/social media hype up PLTR but analysts say to sell now? Am I missing something? Why is PLTR so popular with Reddit when analysts predict negative returns?

We have seen that the short-sale has destroyed the stock mark and has caused the shares for some companies with the worst fundamentals to jump 6000% in less than a month. I was wondering why SEC does not ban this silly short sale concept? It makes no-sense to sell something that you do not own and then have to buy back at 6000% of what you sold it for. There are silly and irresponsible people everywhere so it is the responsibility of the lawmakers to ensure that things like this do not happen. Politics aside, I know this was mentioned by the former U.S. President but it never went beyond that statement.

I've looked back at all of my trades (I started back in March) and if I had held every single one of my trades for an extra 24 hours, I'd be up over 2000% on my initial buying power, compared to being at a simple 5% right now.

You might think that all your fellow beginner investors are in on the action and making thousands a day, while you're just working your 9 to 5 and investing in decent companies like a sucker. That's how FOMO works.

Trying to understand the situation as lot of people here playing this short squeeze rally here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My brokerages are CONSISTENT trash heaps. Tell me brokers that actually function. Thinkorswim robbed me again today. The most relevant periods in the market are often the first 30m, and that's exactly when TDA "blinds" me, making me unable to see charts, or even CLOSE a trade I just entered. Market orders are not filled for several minutes, turning profitable exits into a loss of a good lunch. My internet connection is just fine.
The R-word brokerage was just as bad, guilty of the same and telling me "thanks for your kind words" mockingly after my umpteenth complaint. I took all my funds from there to Thinkorswim and now need to walk away from a dumpster fire a second time.
I put in all the work to finally become a profitable trader and now the big brokerages are here trying to kill off the retail trader. In general, the more profitable I'd be on a day, the more likely the brokerage keeps me out of the market, keeping my wins all small.

If there is any way for me to have an alternative execution platform that doesn't rely on TD not even filling a market order or canceling an existing one, feel free to mention that too. Since Schwab owns TD I am very nervous about trying that. 

Also my balance is sub-$27k at present, U.S. citizen  if that affects who I can join. I also prefer a place with some kind of insurance so they can't just close up shop and flee with the customers' money, and am not opposed to non-U.S. brokers who have it. Also I trade mainly stocks & I'm looking to try futures. Options are not too important to me.

At least I had no intention of closing my GME position today._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can I get some words of encouragement? I’m close quitting the stock market. I spent a month before getting in researching and reading stock books. They say “invest into ETFs” or “reinvest dividends” or due DD before buying a stock. Watch the news, don’t invest into meme stocks.

Only to get into the market and see people making life changing money in under a month off stocks, while I make chump change by listening to what these books have said. AMC was nearly bankrupt, now they’re skyrocketing even though they’re in a load of debt. DD will tell you not to invest. TSLA is valued at $247 and was $85/share this time last year. It’s now at $900. 

Why should I stick to what research and these books say about fundamentals, while others just listen to what people on Reddit say and get incredible gains? 

This goes against everything I’ve read researched and it’s frustrating to the point where I’m about to quit. Can someone give me some words of encouragement or a reason not to give up?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How the f**k are people not jumping all over semiconductors?

However, with all the WSB and GME and shorting and all of that, i decided that I would like to get in on the action, but just for fun. What i mean is, I want to buy a stock, just 1.

A serious question here, I am wondering what others are thinking in regards to **AMC** and **GME**. I think the epic short squeeze is great to see, of course that's my opinion. However, We all know that Citron Research and other Short-Sellers are going to go after AMC especially because of the lower price. 

Also, I think they feel that **GME** is too hot at the moment. Of course they have it hard coded to their radar. The Bottom line here and my question is, how high are these two going to go? Is there a political point and message to the short sellers in general? If this is truly a Retail Investors Revenge story, it will be epic to write about. I am considering doing that this week.

I'm very new to buying stocks. I got the app I'm not allowed to mention. I've done some research. I've invested some money I can afford to lose and I've made $200. I plan on scaling up the numbers but I'm just learning the method right now.

Technically I haven't made any money until I sell it though. So when do I sell it? I have 20 years until retirement and nothing else I know of coming up. My plan was to sit on it and monitor it. I'm old enough to know that the market has been particularly good this year and there will be storms. I assume good companies today may not be good investments in 10 years so watch for that. I assume it's like money in the bank in case of unexpected personal financial crisis so maybe sell it then. Am I on the right track? What do seasoned investors do?

Keep calm and carry on I know we've all been reading headlines and opinion articles saying that we're in a bubble, and with record valuations going up, in contrast to the wider global economy, that might be understandable.

Maybe we are, maybe we aren't. Nobody, not any of us, have a crystal ball. It feels like there are two big camps both trying to shout over each other; one saying that the crash to end all crashes is imminent, the other saying the market has fundamentally changed and boom and bust is over.

That noise can be deafening. Meanwhile we all have itchy trigger fingers over our portfolios to either buy or sell.

In a way, we are in uncharted waters. In others, we aren't. Covid and the rise of "big tech" is new, but major conglomerates gaining unrivaled market dominance is not. Stupid IPO valuations and penny stocks are not new, neither are investors chasing fads. As ever, whoever is shouting is generally hoping you will click their link or trade their way so they can make money. Honest brokers they are not.

I held my nerve during the Covid crash last year, then sold up in July fearing a second wave. I bought back in late November after the vaccine was announced, and am up 22% in two months. Naturally I'm very happy with this, but it's also irrelevant.

Every single private investor should be looking at the long game. Your stocks should never be your sole source of equity, and you certainly shouldn't be relying on it for income. If there is a reasonable chance you need access to that money in less than five years, you need to reassess what you can and can't afford to lose.

We don't know what is around the corner, but chances are that the golden rules of investing are still relevant today. Dollar cost averaging and a well diversified portfolio are your friends, do not plunge all into a few hype stocks.

To quote British fund manager Terry Smith; buy good companies, do not overpay, do nothing. If the stock you invested in is genuinely strong with a good balance sheet, it will weather whatever market correction comes our way.

**Business Overview**

Berry Global ($BERY) is a technology and engineering company involved in the manufacturing of plastics packaging for consumer, healthcare, and industrial end-markets. They are a low cast manufacturer with 70% of sales in stable, consumer oriented end-markets. They have ~$12B of revenue and $2.2B of EBITDA. They make over 100,000 items including masks, bottles, cups, wipes, films, and many others.


I think BERY has the potential to double over the next year and triple over the next few years with fairly low downside risk in the stock from current levels. This is not near the highly speculative GME, AMC, PLTR etc. type return profile, but I think Berry offers an attractive risk-adjusted return profile for more conservative investors or the more conservative part of an investor’s portfolio (I am not advocating rotating from GME into this).


**Bull Case:**


* Strong Free Cash Flow
   * More than $1b of normalized free cash flow generation on 
   * $7b market cap. Guidance of $875-$975m in 21 with some excess cash flow.
   * Trades at like a 14-15% FCF yield to equity vs. packaging comps trading at 6-7%, implying stock can double. FCF yields this high at time when Treasury rates at historical lows.
* Good growth for the industry 
   * Grew 4% in most September quarter and solid growth expected to continue.

   * Plastics are not going away and are actually growing.
* Cheap vs. Competitors

   * Trades at ~7.6x EV/EBITDA vs. its closest competitor Amcor trading at ~11.5-12x.  (BERY is #2 and Amcor is #1 in plastic packaging with Berry being very close behind in size)

   * Small private transactions in the plastic packaging space on lower quality businesses have been in high single-digit context to low to mid-double digit context (10x+)

   * Stock more than doubles if it closes the valuation gap.
* Will start giving $ to Bulls this year

   * Company expects to start dividend/buybacks sometime in 21 after reaching its leverage target.
* Global leadership position with scale

   * 2nd largest plastics producers (~90%+ of biggest) and more double the third largest.
* Strong sustainability thesis

   * Plastic is actually better for the environment in terms of water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste, and energy than other items. 
* Leverage going down. Expects to reach 3.8-3.9x by September 2021

   * Should be able to start share buybacks/dividends to give cash to holders this year in 2021.
* Good acquisition history and consolidation opportunity

   * Strong track record of completing acquisitions and getting good synergies to make shareholder value.

   * BERY can continue to acquire small names and get cost-synergies, creating value.
* Downside Limited

   * Stock pretty fundamentally cheap even if bull case doesn’t play. Even in “worst case”, hard to see this stock down more than 20% vs. current levels ex another great depression.  Downside is limited given the defensive industry and strong cash generation and ability of the company repurchase stocks beginning this year if the stock becomes too cheap.

   * Pandemic also good for this stock as it makes masks so continued Covid is not really a downside here.


**Bear Case:**

* “Boring” Stock
   * Stock is not currently sexy and is in a “boring” industry compared to EVs and traditional technology.
*  “High” leverage

   * Levered ~4.4x, currently, which is higher than other blue-chip names
* Plastic Risk

   * Investors are worried about plastics going away, even though they’re not and growing. Business needs to show good organic growth to get rid of this fear.
* Raw material volatility

   * Company has to pass-through raw material changes to customers, which can cause short-term volatility. However company has strong pass-through mechanism and history doing it.

Key Catalysts:
* Earnings- Q4 Earnings Friday Feb 5th and Q1 earnings sometime in May and other earnings later in the year.

   * Key question for earnings is continued organic growth of the business. Continued demonstration of growth allows this business to re-rate higher.
* Berry hitting 4x leverage and announcing either share buybacks or a dividend. Predict this to occur in mid 2021

   * Lower leverage and announcement of capital return may allow this business to re-rate higher.


**Prediction:**

I believe the stock offers strong upside in the highest probability base and bull case scenarios with limited downside in the bear case scenario.	


**Base Case Scenario:** Berry de-levers throughout this year to 4x or less and reports continued strong organic growth, partially helped by growth in their health-sector (BERY sells masks) and the industrial recovery when it occurs later in the year. They announce capital return to equity shareholders as well. The combination of these factors causes the business to re-rate closer to Amcor to ~10x EV/EBITDA or an 8% FCF yield in my base case. This leaves the stock at $100 in base case (roughly a double).


**Bull Case Scenario:** is this re-rates along with the market and investors realizing plastic continues to grow, allowing both it and its plastics comps to re-rate closer to the 13x-15x EV/EBITDA range, putting you at  a $150-$180 stock price target (making this potentially a 3-4x opportunity). This is probably less likely in the short-term (next 1 year, but can occur if investing with a multi-year timeline)


**Bear Case Scenario:** Stock De-rates to 6.5x EV/EBITDA with soft organic growth , 16-18% FCF yield with a stock price of ~$43. Stock stays dirt cheap and is priced like plastics will not exist after 2026. I find this unlikely and this is only ~15% downside vs. today’s price. 


**Disclaimer:** I own shares in Berry. I am not a financial adviser and this is not investment advice. Also, I’m not an anti-GME shill and support the GME crew and am not advocating to sell GME to buy this.

The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet again, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn’t a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don’t really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I’ll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

Looking for advice on a mock portfolio that would have an initial $1000 invested in it.

As the title says I'm looking to get into investing as I want to get in while I am young and able to capitalize fully on the potential of my investments. As I am a student I have both limited knowledge and limited funds to throw around from the outset and do not want my first investments to go poorly due to a lack of knowledge. 

For context, I have no interest in trading as it seems dangerous for the ill-informed and too hands-on. Also, for this reason, I've taken a general interest in ETFs and Index Funds instead of stocks as I feel I will not have the time to do proper research and analysis of multiple stocks. I've attempted to put together a portfolio that I believe is solid for my initial investment ($1000) and plan to expand as I learn and develop a deeper understanding of what exactly I'm doing.

&#x200B;

**Portfolio 90/10**

* **Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAM) - 18%**

\- I was going to go into BEP but I figured investing in the parent company will expose me to its subsidiaries and thus provide a broader net into renewable energy

* **Canopy Growth Corp (CGC) - 18%**

\- While this goes against my individual stock feelings I believe cannabis will become a sizable market provided a successful rollout into the USA. And I also believe for this industry I may see the best returns investing directly in a singular company rather than an index like the MJ or HMMJ

*  **First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR) - 18%** 

\- Being in the tech field I believe there is a large value to be placed on cybersecurity, and from what I've seen. I do not feel like the current market necessarily reflects that.

*  **3D Printing Etf (PRNT) - 18%**

\- Along the lines of cybersecurity (but to a lesser degree) I believe 3D printing and the technologies associated with it will become much more prevalent over the next decade so getting in now seems right to me

* **ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) - 18%**

\- Again going with the tech theme I think this ETF holds value as while I am double dipping in some 3D printing and cybersecurity holdings. I get my foot in the door with companies such as Tesla. Which, while maybe overvalued right now, I believe Tesla has established itself as a company that will consistently perform well.

*  **Vanguard Total International Bond Index  (BNDX) - 10%**

I’m confused about the rebalancing of ETFs — 

I own some shares of RETL which did pretty well today because of a particular gaming company that shall not be named. According to ETFdb as of today that gaming company made up 4% of the ETF’s holdings. 

How can I determine how often an ETF rebalances their holdings to avoid one stock that does really well from having an outsized impact?

Operation WARPSPEED today has reallocated millions of dollars of resources away from vaccine production and towards the production of lenzilumab. The data from the 2 trials is still blinded yet the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT is basically saying “Make fucking space for this therapeutic drug that will be the cure to CoVid19 for Humanity.” 

Eversana signed a contract with Humanigen basically saying they will work for free to distribute and administer the drug until they get EUA sometime in March. Mexico, South Korea, and Brazil are negotiating on how much of the drug they are able to buy.

Workhorse ($WKHS) has been in the ranks for months now after a MASSIVE explosion in June of 2020 due to a potential "speculation" of obtaining the new 8.3 Billion (20 Bil over next 10 years) United States Postal Service Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Contract (NGDV). They've been in the biding process competing with various other companies since 2015 and it's finally down to the wire with 3 competitors left in the NGDV bid.

**Oshkosh/Ford** \- Who've submitted an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle and have a history of federal contracts.

**Karsan Motors** \- A Plug-In Hybrid vehicle owned by a Turkish company.

AND...... **Workhorse** \- *The ONLY fully electric, American owned and made vehicle left in the contract.*

And if you that that was enough to buy, wait till you read the rest of this.

In 2019, Workhorse and Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2 mil square foot GM manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio. Although, its primarily used today for Lordstown Motors, the CEO has been on record saying it will lend WKHS whatever necessary to help them fulfil the USPS contract. And with the recent news form Biden saying the federal fleet will be replaced with fully electric made, Made in America vehicles, this is more than in the bag.

Everyone's favorite body pillow waifu, Kathy Woods of Ark invest saw this opportunity back in June and has been loading up. At the time of this post WKHS sits in ARK-Q's 18th position.

[https://ark-funds.com/arkq](https://ark-funds.com/arkq)

This also comes on the fact that WKHS has a LARGE amount of short interest for a stock going to the moon, sitting at 30 mil short shares out of its 112 mil.

WKHS currently sits at a 3.8 Bil market cap, now it's true there's a good amount of the contract priced in already but no the short interest squeeze that could happen as a result of the news. When WKHS gets awarded the contract, were looking at at least 8.1 Bil witch correlating that into the share price sets a Price Target of around $90 a share. And that's not even adding in the recent Price Motors order of over 6,000 vehicles.

In 2015 UNFI traded as high as $80 per share back when their revenue was 8B. Back then they had 50,100,946 shares which made their market cap 4B or 50% of revenue.

In 2018 something strange happened - David absorbed Goliath. UNFI paid 3B for SuperValu (wholesaler and retailer of grocery products) to more than double their revenue from 10B to 21B becoming the largest grocery wholesaler in North America. This acquisition was completely financed by debt so their outstanding number of shares remained relatively low.

Then in 2020 the mother of all tailwinds hit - COVID. Imagine when the only food you're allowed to go out for is from a grocery store? Restaurant sales plummeted, but grocery sales went up. In addition interest rates went down (remember that SuperValue was purchased completely with debt). So interest costs for UNFI have come down.

Today UNFIs market cap is only 1.755B (7% of sales) and less than half of what it used to be when revenues were only 8B. If UNFI returned to its old valuation 50% of its current sales (26B) that would mean a market cap of 13B. And given the number of outstanding shares being 56,135,393, we're looking at a per share price of $231.

Everyone is skeptical of Chinese stocks due to their differing regulations causing trust issues.  However, Ark would know this and they have still invested heavily.  

The news recently broke out that Baidu were teaming up with Geely to make an "intelligent EV", so it wouldn't surprise me if Ark knew this before us and therefore increased the investment.
  
What we also know is that Ark Invest have just revealed their "2021 Big Ideas", with Deep Learning on the list (something that Baidu has invested in) and EVs.  Baidu have 7000 AI patents, the largest in China, though Baidu being involved in AI has been known for a while.  Baidu also owns iQIYI, the Chinese video streaming service, a sector Ark are also bullish on, demonstrated by their conviction in Roku.  Streaming may be utilised even more if people ride in autonomous vehicles. 

So if this EV stuff really happens it'll be by a company in a huge market, and one that already has it's hands in AI/Deep learning and video streaming, and considering Ark is bullish on these 3 areas, i.e. EVs, streaming, AI, I think this may explain why they are bullish.

This individual was wrote to by a company telling him that he could make serious money by doing what he does already, all he has to do is mention a few specific penny stocks to his audience throughout his videos. This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I’m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it’s better to be cautious and always do your own research first.

Once the shorter is forced to buys stocks, they give the stocks to the lender.

&#x200B;

Q1. I assume its in the best interest of the lender to sell the stock like a hot potato while the stock is still overpriced. How quickly can the lender sell the returned stock? Is there like a processing period of a few days to transfer the stock between the shorter to the lender? I feel this is important to know to determine how fast the stock price will crash.

Q2. Can the shorter buy stocks privately? Can the shorter make a deal with a large shareholder to buy stocks outside the stock market?

Q3. Can the shorter make a deal with the lender(s) to void the contract?

&#x200B;

I feel like Q2 and Q3 are important because the shorter can potentially bypass the stock market and all the people working to raise the stock price get screwed over since they can't sell their shares. Is there regulation that prevent Q2 and Q3?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What stocks to buy 2021. First time invester, I've got 700 bucks into PLTR already.

Today was the day that stocks like Norton, IBM, Oracle, SAP, VMware, Bandwidth, Fastly surged and long pairs such as Twilio, Snowflake, Crowdstrike and CloudFlare plunged.

There is few data points here. But my thesis is that many hedge funds that runs with 130% long and 30% short are reducing their gross leverage because they are afraid of people squeezing their positions. It's a bad time to short anything at this market.

If you know who story continues to skyrocket and specially if stocks like (you also know who) continues to go up, the afraid may be higher.

2021 market crash will be caused by Bankers lending too much leverage to firms who can not cover.

We're going to see multiple hedge funds/institutions declare bankruptcy very soon which will force them to close all their positions and cause a pretty big market sell off. Now something like this isn't really enough to cause a major crash but the real danger is how deep these firms are in the red when their lenders are forced to pay their client's mistake to GemE shareholders.

If the lenders(usually giant investing firms and banks) somehow don't have the liquid capital to close out their borrower's positions, then we'll see the dominos start falling as they too start liquidating their own stock positions which then causes a even bigger sell off.

But we're not done just yet. What if GemE reaches such an absurd price that results in the huge institutions and banks to owe more money than their entire networth? This is what happened in 2008 and this is what the elites are scared of.

I seriously see this all playing out and GemE hitting a ludicrous price in the thousands.

Not many people know about call options potential on this stock should the story take hold._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just buying KR and WMT each month I have my general investment and Roth IRA that is diversified.  I'm thinking about doing a separate account and buying $50 of Kroger and $50 of Wal-Mart each month. Both of these are retail/grocery giants and I think they are both poised for long term growth.  I don't want to buy a staples ETF or retail ETF as I already have that in my general investment account.  Just wanted to see your thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Even if the Market Tanks... And some people get discouraged, and never touch stocks again, wouldn't most just come back in and either play puts or buy the dip like they did when COVID hit?

I've noticed that a lot of retail investors, especially those who are younger, entered the market around March if not later throughout 2020 when COVID paranoia crashed the market 35% in a matter of 3 weeks or so. 

I feel like this massive influx of investors was due to two reasons: A seemingly "once-in-a-generation" buying opportunity, and democratization of the stock market which I'll explain what I mean by that.

As far as the buying opportunity, the 2020 crash was the fastest ever recorded. Not only was it due to geopolitical lockdowns and businesses closing down, but fear and panic spread like a pandemic itself because of so much access to media nowadays. Because of this almost instant opportunity, the first reason I do theorize that so many younger investors threw so much money with reckless abandon at the market is because they saw and still see no other way to attain great wealth. For example, for a lot of us, college is one field that is extremely expensive and even for graduates, there is an oversaturated supply of degrees yet a lower demand for jobs pertaining to those degrees. Many individuals end up unemployed or underemployed wage slaves, thus leaving many in debt. When you look at housing, housing prices are completely through the roof, and I'm not even talking about the nominal prices of homes, I'm talking about the real, adjusted-for-inflation price which have still shot up in many areas by a ridiculous amount. For most, buying cash is a long shot, and getting into a loan is simply financial slavery. 

Because of this, I figured many of us felt pressured to throw money into the market and "get rich or die trying". That was at least my mentality after not looking at my account for so long and I'm sure many others felt the same way.

The second reason the market has been propped up so much is due to the democratization or simple, easy access to the market nowadays. In today's day and age, brokerage fees are nonexistent so not only does that make investing psychologically more friendly, but it encourages trading and riskier plays. The removal of fees is a lot more inviting to younger folks who want to put money in the market and I remember as recent as late 2018 when I opened my account, I had to pay commission fees to buy shares of AAPL. 

Aside from the fees, information is so much more accessible nowadays and hype/narratives spread like a pandemic. I remember back in March, everyone on YouTube and Social Media was talking about "buy-the-dip", "once-in-a-lifetime", etc. Word spreads and that got more people into the market because 2020-21 is a lot different than 2008-09. I'm sure there weren't too many people on a primitive Twitter or Facebook screaming "buy now" back when the Financial Crisis bottomed. Since a lot more people have access to the internet, the word is spread many times faster. 

Going from hype onto information, even though there is a lot of garbage out there and self-proclaimed or accidental "geniuses", there is a lot of great DD from your fellow average Joe on forums, sites, etc. Chatrooms nowadays are way bigger than those back in 1999 or 2007. If not chatrooms, platforms like YouTube were either nonexistent or just full of cat videos, 300 Sparta memes, and corny homemade 240p skits. Nowadays, most people don't need to listen to a hedge fund manager or a talking head on CNBC to get information on a stock, *without having to even look at financial statements.* Other Internet users do the investigating and deep-diving for you. This is akin to the car industry. Back in say 2005, car salesmen wound up like bandits because the internet was not as big back then, so many clients didn't know much about the car (both features and prices/deals) and they often ended up getting taken for a ride (no pun intended) and burned. Nowadays, clients more often than not actually know more about the vehicle than the salespeople themselves, and have the access to do their DD in regards to pricing, deals, rates, etc. so they are more cautious and can figure whether a deal presented to them is bad or not. 

This leads me to this question, even if the markets were to crash, given the speed of hype and information nowadays, wouldn't retail just pick it right back up? Or would it be a drawn out recovery like the one after 2008-09 that took years? What do you think?

**TL ; DR**

Given a highly volatile stock is it smarter to use graduating sell limit orders spreading your stock over a range of prices or use a trailing stop percentage and putting the order in at a certain price? Is there ever a reason why a trailing stop percentage order would not be filled? I've read about gapping, let's say you put in a TSP with a percentage of 10%, a stock hits $100 and suddenly drops 5%, triggering a halt, then when trading resumes it drops another 10% and surpasses your original TSP order, does your order still get filled? 

&#x200B;

Obviously there's a chance your TSP order gets filled prior to the stock hitting it's actual peak if it is highly volatile, but don't you stand to gain more by putting in a TSP order and hitting a higher peak minus the percentage vs graduated limit sell orders?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 1/27/2021 -- ThinkOrSwim Chart Import Links are Included)! $AOS  - Died right into support that is also in line with a good trendline! 200EMa is also right there, what a great setup.

_____________________

**Intro**

The case for Petco (NASDAQ:[WOOF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WOOF)) is a decent one. Petco was once a mail-order veterinary supplies shop in 1965 that grew into an entire pet care “ecosystem”, featuring a boatload of stuff ranging from healthcare to supplies to services to training to even fashion and random accessories. While not exactly an original idea, Petco executes this one-stop-shop for pet owners (especially dog owners) in a very streamlined fashion. Competitors like PetSmart give Petco some trouble, but it has found footing and a corner in the market. Petco has [1500](https://about.petco.com/) stores in the states, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. [Over 100](https://about.petco.com/2019-08-06-Petco-Expands-Footprint-of-In-Store-Veterinary-Hospitals-with-New-Regional-Partners) of those have veterinary hospitals in them, and [85](https://www.petco.com/unleashed) are quaint neighborhood pet spa and outlet locations. Animal supply stores are generally considered essential services and have largely remained open in many locations.

  

**Summary**

Petco has proved to be a dominating force in the animal welfare industry, despite heavy competition and a raging pandemic. Their overall balance sheet demonstrates positive cash flow, growth, and low indebtedness. CEO Ron Coughlin has pushed the needle towards greater eCommerce and data analytics, which directly translated to better sales. Their long presence in the market, combined with investment into the future and loyal multi-channel members, is poised for growth. It appears to be largely undervalued and is likely to grow and at least double by EoY.

  

Opening fair value: $19.05

Current support: $26.77-$25.32

Projected target range EOM: ~$35

Potential for Q1: ~$40-50

  

**Finances**

Petco is performing quite well, with an overall increase of revenue by 0.96% YoY to $4.4B total. Even though a pandemic raged on, Petco managed to raise its operating income to $127M, a factor of 83.5% TTM.  An EBIDTA margin of 6.84% is seen YoY, but with a -15.45% decline in growth. This is not indicative of a negative trend. For FY20, Petco’s SG&A expense has grown to $1.6B and is likely to trend upwards as the company expands its luxury brand of food, its eCommerce platform, and its premium store features. Petco brought in an extra 300M YoY cash flow through contractual obligations (debt), likely to pad the impacts of COVID-19 and ensure upwards growth of their modern business model. They should have no issue covering this amount based on the present trend.

  

The CEO has 66M Class C shares on a 4-year vesting schedule, ending in 2024. Note, quarterly reports and other items are not available yet. Petco’s financial history is largely private.

  
  

**Business Model**

Petco has a great eCommerce platform that supports BOPUS (buy-online, pick-up in-store), curbside pickup, and ship-from-store, finding 3x to 6x more sales than single-channel customers. As of Oct 31, 2020, they retain roughly 80% of their multi-channel customers. Coupled with loyalty programs (which account for 80% of transactions n the same time period), Petco seems to have built a dedicated fan base. With the strategic location of their physical network--within 3 miles of 54% of their customers--and expanding network of affordable veterinary services, Petco finds customers in deep reaches of various regions nationwide. HP vet Ron Coughlin took the CEO reins in 2018, and he is keen on growing cloud-facing technology. Ron has put focus on investing in data analytics to improve Petco eCommerece and physical store performance, spending nearly $107M over 2018 and 2019 to do so.

  

**Charity**

The Petco Foundation has contributed over $280M since 1999 to help animals. Petco features a partnership with JustFoodForDogs, bringing forward a luxury “human grade” meals market that has fought through COVID-19 impact. They have demonstrated a great focus on removing unethical food and gear, such as artificial ingredients from foods and shock collars from shelves. Petco supports a variety of positive programs designed to educate the public on proper animal treatment and practices. The Petco Foundation has a great presence in [pet cancer treatment](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/petco-foundation-continues-commitment-to-fund-pet-cancer-treatment-at-top-us-universities-and-expands-initiative-to-support-other-critical-pet-health-care-needs-301153682.html) funding. In addition, Petco has dedicated funds to the service and therapy dog sector--especially dealing with veterans. Petco arguably has a big footprint in the domestic pet charitable mission, however, PetSmart does have [$450M+](https://petsmartcharities.org/) contributed.

  

**Competition**

PetSmart does own Chewy since 2017, and was previously publicly traded under PETM but went private in 2015. In mid-2015, a merger was underway between Petco and PetSmart, which fell through when equity firm BC Partners bought out PetSmart for $7.8B. The 2019 Chewy IPO paid off a chunk of the PetSmart debt, stabilizing their business model. Despite being a majority owner, Chewy is still an independent subsidiary, and PetSmart does not seem to be changing its eCommerce structure to match that of the legendary Ryan Cohen. PetSmart’s footprint is nearly double that of Petco’s from an employee, online, and store perspective. They have around 1650 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. 200 of those stores have boarding facilities for animals. The PetSmart-Petco fight is neck and neck, with PetSmart slightly edging out with better services. 

Checking out the social trends, PetSmart generally has more favorable reviews and activity on Google Trends. However, this heavily depends on regionality. Surveying some friends in New England, they agree that Petco is cleaner and provides a better shopping experience through multi-channel sales. This trend is reflected on the region map below. Largely, per Google Trends, the New England and North West market prefer Petco over PetSmart. Considering population density and cost of living in these regions versus the South and Mid-west, Petco’s dominant presence in these areas certainly has an advantage.

[Petco vs PetSmart Region Chart](https://i.ibb.co/ZxKYZvB/0126-112-Darkgoldenrod-Rattlesnake.png)


**Risk**

The risk with Petco is virtually low. As they’ve secured a market share, have loyal clients, and came out positive during a pandemic, the likelihood of a systematic collapse is improbable. Petco’s growth is commendable, but it may not have enough revenue to close out 2021 with positive cash flow. It may encounter a roadblock in expanding the market for luxury pet food, especially in the Midwest region, which can provide an edge up for PetSmart to take a bigger foothold. However, the exponential growth of metropolitan areas--and the preference densely-packed locations have for Petco--may provide enough buffer for Petco to dominate. 

  

With their increased focus on eCommerce, should it be breached (as their subsidiary PupBox already has in [December](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/petco-cyberattack-serves-as-useful-38468/)), online traffic may suffer as a result. The PupBox exposed client and payment data in plaintext, [according to](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/law-firm-investigating-pupbox-data/) allegations for a class-action lawsuit. Through data gathered on LinkedIn and their site, few roles can be found centric around network security. In fact, only one “information security analyst” was located, with a number of director-level personnel responsible for oversight of IT, compliance, and monitoring. Note that Petco is likely utilizing a Managed Security Services Provider, which is not publicly disclosed but can be [noted](https://www.rapid7.com/c/p/) in several instances through open searches. When eCommerce organizations lack proactive security staff, breaches are more likely to occur, which in turn leads to loss of business and lawsuits. It is important to note that this is partially speculative, not indicative of their whole security posture, and is not the full picture.

They have submitted an MAA to the European Medicine Agency and in the USA to the FDA for Uterine Fibroids which appears to be close to approval.

Assuming I had $14483 dollars available to buy this contract and immediately sold those 100 shares at $200 which is near the current price I’d met $6k immediately?

Would it be smart to put $200 into my brokerage account and as I find companies just invest it. I was considering in investing in several companies that have since risen significantly but missed out because I was worried I would lose money.

If I sell a stock at a loss, I can't buy the same shares again for 30 days per the IRS.  If I sold 1/2 my position at a loss then the next day the price goes way up, I can't even sell my remaining lot for a gain, or it will be 'nullified' by my broker as a wash sale.  

How can High Frequency Traders (HFT's) not always have some sort of loss on a stock?  They're buying shares at $50.001 and hoping to sell at $50.006 for example, which would make them 1/2 of 1 cent per share.  However, it is equally likely the stock will go down to $49.996 and they will lose 1/2 of 1 cent per share.  Per the definition of 'high frequency trading' they're not going to sit on the stock until it goes up to $50.006, as it may never get there.  

So how do they not regularly have wash sales which would wipe out their gains and therefore all subsequent profits?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does aftermarket trading work?

DFV shone the light and many other big money firms have jumped in. With the 🚀 stock above $115 Melvin should get called to liquidate their holdings to cover losses and even fend off bankruptcy. They simply can’t hold on in this environment. 

Here’s the question, if they need to close positions doesn’t that mean unwinding the rest of their shorts? The stock in the news was one of many short positions Melvin held (holds?). If all the above is true a good way to play this would be to grab shares (or calls for the risky) in their other short positions expecting large buying to close out their shorts. Open to discussion. Here’s the list at the beginning of Q4 last year. You can see it’s already started.

I guess I didn't get on board this train, I've been very focused on index fund investing with VT. A certain stock has been on such a crazy run it makes me wonder if I'm doing something wrong. How do you deal with FOMO?

I've done so much reading over the past year into how to get into stocks and nothing actually seems to fit as a complete picture. How do you build conviction and actually build some positions (on the side from my index funds). Analysis doesn't fully make sense to me and valuations everywhere seem insane. It's all very overwhelming which is why I backed off to indexing. 

Do you have any advice for me going forward? I've been told by this community in particular it may be smart to build more risk into my portfolio, how exactly do I do that properly?

ICLN (Clean Energy)
