NIO up or down on Monday? So of course it’s going up. Stonks only go up. But genuinely I see a bull and a bear case regarding this stocks performance leading up to ER. For the bulls, you have a lot of investors who missed out on gains beforehand who now want to buy in on the pullback. You also see a lot of big firms adding to their positions. The hype behind NIO is insane and I see that driving it up as well before earnings. On the other hand, you probably have a lot of people who still have shares and options and want out. They didn’t sell before the pullback and now are looking for any rally to sell. So we could see a small rally on Monday before a pullback as those paper hands sell. Also with other companies tanking after earnings, you could see more people selling to avoid being burned like with pltr and rkt. Honestly I’m not sure which way it’s gonna go. What do you guys think? I am probably gonna buy on market open and then set a 3% trailing stop limit and just forget about it. Also excuse if I said anything retarded I only started trading and investing last week._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are there any verified reports of people on this sub actually being successful day traders in the long run that wasn't blind luck? lol More questions in body of post. I flared as discussion, because I am genuinely curious if there is something I am missing. Disclaimer: I have never day traded before but every class I took on investing and finance has reiterated how risky and ultimately bad of an idea, day trading is. I am failing to see how in the long run this is anything past fun, gambling or beer (and in rare cases, car) money this is. The only remote way I see this as being worthy is if you have enough money to spare to actually make good short term gains, play very safe(whatever that means) and then invest those gains into long term investing strategies.

So I am curious if there are any verified cases of people who actually played this game and in the long run have been successful. What keeps you coming back, when I see almost everyone losing their shirts. Can you REALLY get good at day trading? Is there anything besides degeneracy, lunacy, addiction and lolz that keeps you coming back to day trading?

Very legit _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SE: Short Vol, Long Delta - The Hummingbird Spread $SE, or Sea Limited, is an internet and mobile platform company. The firm engages in the provision of online gaming services. It currently has platforms like Garena (gaming platform), Shopee (e-commerce), and SeaMoney (digital currency). Furthermore, this company is based in Singapore and has seen tremendous growth throughout the year. ADR/OTC products seems to have a bit of lag (for example, look at $TSLA and $NIO relationship) behind its industry counterparties. $SE may see growth like $AMZN and other tech companies, but in Singapore.

$SE is due to report earnings this Tuesday. The implied move of $SE is 15%, meaning people are expecting the stock to move from $180 to either $155 or $205. Historically, this has never happened before in an earnings. Current revenue/EPS projections do not justify such a movement, either.

$SE also has the most popular game in the world right now -  Free Fire. Want to know an interesting fact about fire? Fire is bad for hummingbirds, and has destroyed many of their homes. How can we use this information to generate alpha?

Here, the light gray area represents the movement of 1 STDEV (encompassing \~68% of the likely move). Taking the integral of this region (which is the expected value of the trade), we end up seeing a \~3.2% ROI. The only way we lose is if $SE absolutely tanks and crashes to the ground.

OpenDoor has the potential to become the next meme stock. It is transforming the real estate market through simplifying a complex, costly, and long process to sell or buy a house into a simple process. Think Carvana but for your house. The market is massive – nearly $1.6 trillion annually and this company already has traction, booking nearly $5B in revenue in 2019 (with a dip in 2020 due to COVID) and ramping growth going forward. $3.5B in sales expected in 2021, $10B in 2023.

The company has a leadership team from all the well known, successful unicorns – Amazon, Trulia, Square, Netflix, AirBNB, Uber, Lyft, Google, FourSuqare, and well known institutions like TPG.

One of the most well known disruptive technology investors, Ark Funds (Cathie Wood, $20B AUM), has already invested in 3MM shares as of this past Friday, taking close to 10% of the publicly available float of IPOB. Ark was one of the earliest believers in TSLA and a number of other names. The Ark funds returns are best in class and it’s rare to see a megafund like this make such a large bet on a company that is 1) a SPAC and 2) hasn’t even merged yet.

When the combination is likely complete by end of year, this will allow other funds to invest and they will very much likely follow Cathie’s lead given her track record and reputation.

Zillow at 2.3x 2023 revenues, and Redfin at 2x 2023 revenues. Assuming Opendoor at 2x 2023 revenue would yield a share price of the following:

2x 2023 revenue x $10B = $20B TEV

Current TEV implied of \~$10B, so about 100% upside from today’s levels assuming no premium for the faster growth rate from Opendoor and much larger addressable market opportunity with the ibuying focus and infrastructure (nearly 60-65% share). With the merger coming, it will catapult shares higher with not many shares left to grab with Ark and others sucking them up.

Papa Elon is a genius, 2020 is proof of that as Tesla has sky rocketed. Elon is behind the innovation of PayPal, Tesla and Space X. EV and Fintech are clearly amazing investments and are the future of technology, everyone knows that. What people haven’t been talking about though is SPACE. 

Space is going to be the next Robinhood bubble industry. What makes a retard hornier than an electric vehicle? Papa Elon sending you off into a giant gay dildo to space. 

Ticker SRAC is taking the company Momentus public in January. Momentus has already made a deal with Space X to launch their space vehicles in December. Momentus is the “FedEx of space” delivering/transporting satellites for power hungry corporations. I believe that right now this company has potential to 10x your money trading at a $228m market cap. If Elon is really a genius of the future, space stocks are going to be the next big thing. Stock up u retarded aliens. 

Yours Truly,
PapaElonIsMyDad42069_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA IV at lowest point in 6 months. WSB comment volume for TSLA also at lowest volume in months. Coincidence? Tesla's stock price has been doing pretty much nothing for the last 2 months since the drop after the stock split. Queue "Theta Gang Wins" in counterstrike voice here. Anyways, it's interesting that Implied Volatility for the ticker is at it's lowest point in many many months, what's also at the lowest point? The comment volume on this sub-reddit mentioning Tesla stock.

**Here are two charts**

**Top**: The top one shows the stock price (gold line) vs sentiment & comment volume. TSLA comment volume only sitting at 4% of comments that mention a ticker (average was always 10-25%). Also for reference, on Friday, NIO reached 40% of comment volume mentioning tickers in this sub.

**Bottom**: Shows stock price vs average implied volatility for options (blue line). IV range for TSLA was always in the 80-100 range with it spiking pre-earnings to 160%. Currently sitting at only 60%! Meaning calls are at the cheapest they've been in quite some time.

Has Musk lost his luster? Or is Tesla getting ready for take-off? One thing is for sure you don't want to be buying calls when the blue line get's too high.

Starting the Hourly chart: We can clearly see DKNG's Friday opening put in a divergent high as price action moved up but RSI showing lack of momentum, which is why we sold off all day.

On to the Daily chart: As we all know already, DKNG has a YUGE down move the last couple of weeks.  We're now settled inside the ascending wedge consolidation pattern which indicates a continuation of a next leg down.  I'm showing resistance at around $43.50, BUT, I think we may touch $45 before we start to break down out of the wedge.  However, we did close below support so the chances of going higher are pretty low.  If / When we do break down, I see this thing going as low as $20, drawn out by the trend line at the top of the wedge.

So here we are, TA coupled with an abysmal earnings report, plus questionable completion of any sports ball season till a vaccine is mainstream.  Seems to me, there's a lot of downside here.

COVID cases are utterly [out of control](https://imgur.com/a/Jez0RVo), mainly in states that are [politically opposed](https://imgur.com/a/xj6i9Pi) to wearing masks. 

Thanksgiving will be yet another superspreader event. This will set us up for a ridiculous Christmas and New Year's Eve. Without a doubt, by Jan 20, cases will be over 300k/day, and hospitals will be entirely overrun. 

By this time, public health officials will likely be calling for a new shutdown. Trump won't enact this, as it would require him to shift direction in his final weeks of his presidency (not going to happen). To delineate his administration from the previous, Biden will likely go along with what the "scientists" are suggesting, and impose another shutdown in the first weeks of his presidency.

All of this will take place before any further rounds of stimulus will be released. Mitch McConnell will absolutely **NOT** have a second round of stimulus on his tab, mainly so that he can blame the democratic administration for "sinking the economy with their monstrous deficit". Even if an agreement is reached Jan 20, it won't be until mid-Feb at the EARLIEST that we see any stimulus cash in the accounts of regular people.

Meanwhile, small businesses haven't recovered from the first wave. Their consumer base is stretched to breaking. 

This bullrun might continue, but IF we're going to see any cracks, it will be in IWM, before March.

Get your tendies, gay bears._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Margin’d my Margin _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMCX : a short squeeze value stock AMCX is AMC networks, the media company/ TV channel. You may know them from Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Mad Men.

How short is short? AMCX has a float of 25 million shares, and short interest of 18 million shares. About 70%. With daily average volume of 1-1.5 million, it would take about 2 weeks for every short to cover. It is one of the most shorted companies on the market, and currently "hard to borrow," indicating it's not cheap to stay short.

Why is it a value stock? AMCX has a market cap of a billion dollars. AMCX also has cash reserves of... a billion dollars. It has a PE ratio of 10 and a PS ratio of 0.5. In their most recent earnings, they beat. AMCX is a profitable company!

How is it going to squeeze? One good acquisition rumor should do it. There will be consolidation in the streaming content world, and AMCX would be a good pickup for one of the big names. It just popped above its 200 dMA and is looking relatively strong, so it may be slow-motion squeezing already. The company recently bought back 10 million shares, tightening the float.

IMO, it's not a matter of if, but when. Anyone short this name is out of their freakin minds.

Position: March '21 OTM calls.

EDIT: a lot of people shorting my post. Guess we'll see who's right 😎_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO shareholders vs Citron If I am understanding what the accusations are against Citron based on what happened on Friday:   
1) NIO shareholders are holding on to their shares due to the likely event of a positive earnings report that will drive the share price upwards.  
2) Citron sees this as an opportunity to create profit by means of short and distort.  
3) Citron publishes a negative outlook of NIO.  
4) Citron carries out its plan to manipulate NIO's share price on the same day as the negative publication by borrowing a large amount of shares and meticulously driving down the ask price of NIO.  
5) Citron is selling its borrowed shares to investors, who wanted to buy in to NIO before their earnings report but missed out on a previously good entry point.  
6) Citron continuously drives the ask price down with borrowed shares to the bottom of whatever dip they consider to create a worthwhile profit within calculated reason, so as to not draw unwanted legal action. Citron then sells their remainder of their borrowed shares.   
7) At this point, Citron buys back the number of shares equivalent to the number of shares borrowed at this new, artificially created lower price point and returns it.  
8) End result: Citron makes a profit at the cost of creating a micro-panic sell-off. NIO slowly regains its share price. 

Consequence:   
\[Distortion\] Hesitant investors of NIO are now second guessing their investments.  
\[Bitter-sweet\] Long-term investors saw it as a testament to NIO's strength that it began to recover after the short and distort rather than continue a downwards trend after the borrowed shares were sold off.  
\[What-if\] Had this plan never been carried out we'd have easily seen NIO rapidly climb up in share price as demand increased but willingness to sell decreased.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “Numb” loss porn _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020 Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
> That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
> In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
> The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
> # Next hurdle for market
> “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
> The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
> Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
> The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
> # Value vs growth
> Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
> Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&P 500.
*****
> In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
> “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
> Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

> # A Very Good Ten

> With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

> So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

> In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

> # November Expiration Week: S&P 500 & DJIA Stronger

> DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

> S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

> # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

> DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

> This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # New High in New 52 Week Highs

> As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

> Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

> # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

> No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

> In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

> # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

> Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

> # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

> With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

> In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

> Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

> # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

> For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

> The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

> # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

> Pfizer’s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the “go-to” positions throughout most of the pandemic.

> The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

> Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 10k EV Stonk Gains. Sold 2pm 11/12. YTD -0.1% $$$ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citron Research: what else have they called? Everyone has heard about citrons stance on NIO at this point. And you may have seen posts about citrons past calls that makes them look like idiots. Jumia, Shopify, and Facebook are the calls most people focus on. 2 from 2016 one from 2019. The obvious issue there? There were a lot of calls made in that 3 year gap. Cherry picking their biggest losers is something you could do with any investment house considering they make 100s of price targets a year. So in the spirit of fairness I’ve put together some of their winners to show they aren’t as brain dead as some might want you to believe.

HMNY- only those that were too young to be around at the time don’t know about Moviepass. I’ll be honest. I was young and dumber and holding HMNY at this time and I was so fucking pissed when citron posted this story. But now look at the stock price. You’d struggle to even find it since they switch tickers and have reverse split the stock into the ground. Still citron called it and if you listened to them you wouldn’t have a -99.99% position in your account.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/10173237

Jumia- yes one of the companies that you thought was a bad call from them was actually good if you look at what their actual price targets were. Look at jumias chart. Citron shorted them after their IPO at $50 then it dropped to $2. 2 fucking dollars. Are you telling me shorting the stock wouldn’t have made money? After the stock had lost 90% of its value and changed the board heavily. Citron changed its call to bullish. Jumia was no longer overvalued and had fixed its internal issues citron saw. So their stance changed.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/18061798

Valeant- in 2015 valeants stock price was in the $200. Citron ran a story calling them out for inflating drug prices to cook the books. Giving them a PT of $20. A year later their stock had tumbled down to $20 after several investigations were opened.

In 2015 the Wall Street journal investigated citrons previous shorts and found that on average the first year after a citron call companies dropped 42%.

Your choice_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [TSLA vs. Other EVs] Why Do Happy TSLA Investors Cheat on Lord Musk with Other Shitty EV Stocks in their unrelenting search for more tendies? Listen up you retards. 

Some of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don’t have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.

You retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that’s a mistake.

**NIO’s been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**

I know it’s difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven’t we gone through this before? You don’t bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck “rolling down the hill”.

Now I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.

**Chinese EV Demand**

According to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it’s almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let’s say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.

But with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. 

**Model Y’s Importance**

Some of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.

Per Bloomberg, Tesla’s Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO’s growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.

NIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased competition from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.

The biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. 

In comparison, NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase their revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).

**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**

Just a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production will begin in early 2021 but it looks like he’s ahead of schedule.

Additionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. 

NIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. 

That’s right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that’s only Model Y volume. 

If that’s not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose “Battery as a Service” strategy. What is that, you ask? 

Well, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. 

However, NIO has taken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of “battery-swap stations”. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO’s “battery-swap stations” where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. 

Now ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?

**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**

1. NIO can’t compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.

2. Because they can’t compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.

3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)

4. NIO’s “battery as a service” subscription program is retarded.

5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.

All of my loss is from MSFT and all my gains are NIO. Thanks Citron for keeping me level. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIU, get ready and preorder your lambos. Now the hype is all about Chinese electric cars. And rightfully so, but everyone wishes they found out about these stocks before the hype started to grow. Now of course you are wondering what stock is next up for spectacular growth. What is up next?

This is where being retarded comes in handy. Who can better predict retarded hype than a retard himself? If electric cars can get a huge pump, why wouldn't electric scooters pump too? Sounds logical right? The price of these electric car companies is getting high, retards are scared to get in but still want in on the EV hype so they look for alternatives creating the upcoming hype. I can feel it coming boys. 

Currently NIU only has a current market cap of 2,5B, compare it to NIO with a 60B market cap and the potential for growth is huge. They smash earnings time and time again, the growth is there. Fundamental differences between these companies don't matter, retard hype is stronger than anything.

Scooters are way more affordable then cars so every gay hipster will be able to buy one. Cars are getting more and more inconvenient to use in cities. Asians primarily use scooters to get around and shared scooters are getting more and more popular in and outside of Asia.

The only way is up my fellow retards._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nio should be trading at $6 Let's take a look at comparables to NIO, the closest one being Tesla. Tesla currently sits at a valuation of ~$390B. Tesla also has a lot of proprietary technology, a lot of goodwill from their brand, has revolutionary new revenue streams that will be generated from autonomous driving, batteries, and solar stuff.

Nio has none of what I mentioned above, so let's be generous here   and just look at the car manufacturing side and say optimistically Nio should be worth 60% of Tesla.

Tesla delivered 140000 vehicles last quarter, Nio delivered less than 5k


$390B market cap of tesla * .6 = $234B


$234B/140000 vehicles = ~$1.7M per vehicle delivered


1.7M * 4700 vehicles = $8B marketcap


$8B marketcap/Nio shares outstanding = ~$6/share_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey guys, my wifes boyfriend said to post this here https://i.imgur.com/M8rtMy4.jpg

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Found you clowns in the newspapers (daytrader course) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BuY NiO GuYs _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Walmart Breakout Opportunity Hello WSBers,

I am here to analyze a boomer stock with high potential, Walmart. This company is one of the few that is seemingly resistant to the risks associated with COVID, and their new business model makes them even more so.

Everyone knows Walmart is a retail giant that has only increased its domination due to COVID forcing small business shutdowns. You can expect this trend to continue as they get access to even more cheap real estate and labor. While this core business model is still successful and growing, the real growth catalyst is more forwarding looking.

Walmart is pivoting to a subscription model that is very similar to Amazon Prime and offers free shipping & other perks. They only launched the new Walmart+ service on Sept. 1 and according to BMO Equity Research, 16% of US households are already members. Many of the members are millennials and over 90% find the subscription valuable.

140 million Walmart weekly shoppers will be constantly asked if they want to save money by signing up for Walmart+. The potential for explosive growth is there.

In the marketplace arena, it's very clear that Walmart is competing directly against Amazon. Walmart's online presence (providing both their products and those of third party vendors) has been a massive success and is evidence of their ability to adapt.

Walmart's earnings will be available Tuesday, the expected EPS is $1.18. I am expecting it to be $1.25 minimum.

Risks:

1. Price is close to or above many analyst price targets.
2. EPS miss could easily drop it back to $140 or lower.
3. Many people may only be willing to have 1 subscription. Will they choose Walmart+ over Amazon Prime?

Position disclosure:

I bought 11/20 155c on Nov. 3rd. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you want to hedge SPY, look into UBER puts. Folks,

Zitron research here. My proposition is simple. SPY is ATH and you want to buy puts/hedge.  Guess what? UBER is also ATH. And don't forget that there aren't many pandemic-hit stocks right now that are sitting at ATHs.

Before we get into details why I think UBER is overvalued, here is a simple thought process behind this. UBER is a high beta stock. What that means is all else equal it will go higher than SPY on green days but it will go lower on red days.

So what are the likely scenarios in the next few months?

i) SPY can moon to 400, UBER does not have anything negative and UBER moons with it.

ii) SPY fluctuates, but UBER goes down because market realizes things are not improving as well.

iii) SPY tanks, UBER tanks way more.

So the conclusion is I can't see a scenario where SPY goes down/tanks, even stays mostly flat and UBER moons from these already high levels.

And then we delve into details for UBER:

Right now, UBER is a $84bn company. They are trading at close 7x LTM revenue multiple and 5.5x NTM revenue multiple. When markets were at all time high back in February, these metrics were roughly 4.8x and 3.7x, respectively. That was before the Pandemic. But hey delivery is going crazy! lower costs because of Prop 22! Postmates acquisition!

Let's think about these items first.

1. **Economies of scale.** One of the fundamental problems I see with UBER is simply that the economies of scale does not exist, or it is not as great as some of the other technology companies. See, the 1000th ride with UBER is not necessarily cheaper than the first one, yes overhead is distributed accordingly but you simply do not have the growing affect of userbase = free revenue type scenario with most technology companies today. So while margins seem to be improving, I'd argue that margins even in the best case scenario for UBER will be so much lower than any tech company you will see. Simply because they don't own assets, does not mean their returns on capital are high - people are costly and drivers don't exhibit economies of scale patterns.

Now, the only way this was actually achieved and which I think was smart was UBER Pool. With Pool,  what happens is that with the same ride and costs, more revenue can be generated and this was a very smart thing to implement. Post-COVID, Pool is out of the window for the foreseeable future so forget about this. That's why my argument is that margins in the rideshare can only be improved so much.

2) **Delivery business.** I think delivery business is also an area where economies of scale does not exist - margins have a floor, and you have a fierce competition. Unless we start delivering food with robots tomorrow, you can only charge you restaurant and customer so much to make this profitable and booming. See, with UBER Pool economies scale did exist because you did not mind waiting 25 mins in the car to pay less fees. With delivery however, you may not want to wait 3 more foods being delivered before yours, if you end up getting a cold food. So the same deliverer could only deliver so much to generate this effect.

I also do think that competition in this delivery business fierce, and I just cannot see how a company labeled as technology company can thrive on delivery. I mean do we really think with delivery, even if it becomes increasingly profitable, will justify UBER to go $100bn+ ?

3) **Premium segment**. This is more of my observation and can be totally wrong here but whatever is hurting corporate/personal travel from airlines perspective also hits UBER. I think rideshare benefited immensely from corporate/personal travel simply because it solved a big problem when people landed in a different city. Instead of going through the hustle of taxis and all those shady black cars, UBER was convenient, safe, and reliable. Therefore you did not mind getting big black car and paying premium, especially if you were a corporate traveler.

You will notice I did not dig into any financials here. I won't go into too much detail but UBER's balance sheet is shrinking, may become a negative net debt company soon, and even though margins are improving they are actually not growing from a revenue perspective. I still can't think people will be hoarding into UBERs in the post-vaccine world and even if that happens, it will take time. Don't forget that stock price today is based on that expected growth so any quarterly/yearly miss of that growth takes back more than a quarter/year to justify that beginning share price you bought the stock at.

And quite frankly, when things get back to normal, UBER will be offering discounts, aggressive marketing, and all those costs that will hit their G&A significantly, so I still cannot see an easy way to profitability.

It seems like every year they will be profitable next year. If in early 2021 they still cannot seem to get there, will the market still give them the pat on the back? And the better question yet, at $84bn company, higher than its IPO price with highest multiples ever, and with lower revenues than 2019, do we think this stock has more upside or downside to it?

TLDR:

UBER 30P 3/21

UBER 30P 6/21

Edit: For those that think just buy simply SPY puts, sure but the whole point of the argument is that UBER itself is overvalued and there are far more scenarios where SPY can moon but UBER can fail because of its own dynamics. On the flipside, I don't see many scenarios where SPY will tank but UBER will moon. So it's about getting exposed to more probability event, given where things are at the moment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone need any free advice? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I love the WSB discord _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO Call holders outside Citron Headquarters after Friday's close _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uber selling it's Autonomous Units, Put on Uber Hello fellow autists,

As we all know, uber is the most degenerate company of all time.

It has not managed to do anything but lose money, billion a quarter usually.

So what was their long play?

Build a brand, and become an autonomous taxi company so they can get rid of their slave drivers. Well, they've now given up and planning to sell to private company Aurora, which has one of the old google chiefs (just like lewandowski (: )

So now Uber has lost the only thing which could have lead them to profitability.

This is going to fall and fall as people realise they have no paths to profitability left, because why the fuck would Waymo, Yandex or Baidu, (or Aurora) sell them Autonomous tech at face value, when they can dominate the sector themselves.

Uber are desperate for cash, they only have 6 billion left, and they know their only play is to sell stuff. They are selling the wrong unit though, Uber ATG lost them just 303 million in the last 9 months. Uber's primary business lost billions.

Selling ATG will probably give them 15 billion, which will be around 2 years of losing money, but they now have no strategy to become profitable. They are a perpetual money drain, heading towards collapse.

RIP Uber

Please don't be retarded and buy weeklies, this is a long play, buy LEAPS or something.

With that being said in February they did their IPO in February for $28 and sank during March to under $20, so they are still well up for the year.
Peloton were part of the rise of the at home economy as people were buying their $2000+ bikes while gyms were force to close. They did make a profit during that time but the numbers weren’t ridiculously high, which is concerning giving that sales were higher than they would ever be able to maintain. However despite the vaccine news, lock downs are starting to increase globally which could mean there could be some more upside. Another positive is that they are a Becky stock therefore they are likely to beat the S&P.

The Citron's thesis is based on a sole factor that Tesla will set the price of its Model Y where it will undercut the sales of NIO EVs. I can tell you that is totally misguided, mistaken and not aligned with facts and reality. 

Let us look through the numbers and you can draw the conclusion: NIO EVs are currently priced between 350k - 570k RMB ($53k - $95K,  $45k - $85k with BAAS), while the EVs from XPEV, LI, BYD and Tesla Model 3 are priced $250k - $400k RMB ($38k - $61k), with Model Y going from $50k to $80k. For buyers who are price conscious, there are many options in China whereby they can easily save $16k - 30k. But the reality is people are lining up to buy NIO, paying significantly more for NIO EVs, and that should tell you the price is but one factor, and insignificant factor when it comes to choosing NIO over others. NIO has built up its own EV ecosystems inside China, starting with the best EV (design, quality, technologies), comprehensive range extension mechanisms - swappable, upgradable, fast charging and mobile charging, and life enhancing / social fabric forming NIO Houses/Spaces, along with NIO Life. The pioneering BAAS remediates the anxiety over battery and affords NIO owner base cutting edge technology and advancement in battery and others. 

The proper way to look at why people choose NIO while paying more and why NIO is growing over 100% - 200% YOY is that NIO brings about a value proposition that is far and above any of its competitors, a value proposition that its competitor is unable to match unless they change their business model, and a value proposition that has been and is being recognized by more people. 

Andrew Left is in it all for a quick buck, and he is the one that got convicted by HK SEC for spreading false information and stock manipulation, and got his fund confiscated and himself kicked out HK market. Andrew Left, a guy with no moral or conscience, became concerned all of sudden that NIO price is too high. He got trapped as NIO price continued to zoom up after he opened his short / put positions, and the ER next Tuesday will easily lift NIO to above $70, judging from over close to 50% rise of EXPEV and LI after ER this week. Therefore he has to do something quick and dirty by releasing this hit job that really has nothing to try to get himself out of this bind. It is comforting to see NIO closes at $44.50, $3 higher over the close of last Friday. I bought more today with this kind of discount, and I hope and believe more traders  will jump in Monday and Tuesday to pick up more calls leading to the Q3 ER. We know NIO delivered 12205 EVs in Q3, and I am seeing NIO to guide fore 16500-17000 for Q4, and that will be another doubling YOY. By Wednesday, Andrew Left and Citron will all become a blip in the rise of NIO, as he should. Let's hope he will add more to the $3 billion shorties have contributed to the rise of NIO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Term Friday Tendies Stock term Friday:

Just think about it, there's too many bubbles. Every day we're inundated with information carefully outlining the latest bubble we're in. We're attacked every single day with fancy graphs, actual research, and sound logic. The market cannot sustain this many bubbles.

This is clearly an elaborate scheme by market makers such as JPM and Schwabb and Macy's designed to rip us away from our hard earned tendies. But we aren't our parents, we have access to unlimited information at our fingertips and we will not be misled. 

This bubble bubble is going to pop, and once it does we will see that all the aforementioned "bubbles" were not true after all. We will see that stonks only do go up, and only then will we reach true enlightenment.

I also want to preface this by saying, I don't want to see my fellow autists get burned. I know we like to fuck around a lot, but we also like to make tendies, and not lose them. So here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:

**The Good:**

They have a [press release from Oct 2018](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/10/29/1638305/0/en/Electra-Meccanica-Announces-Vehicle-Pre-Orders-Now-Exceed-64-000-Units.html) about their pre-orders exceeding 64k. At a price of $18,500 per vehicle, that's $1.1 Billion in potential revenue (napkin math). I guess you could argue those pre-orders are even higher now, and there's definitely a lot of hype around this company and it's product.

With their media blitz and the [“Drive SOLO” campaign](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/27/2084807/0/en/ElectraMeccanica-Launches-Drive-SOLO-Marketing-Campaign.html), It does have the potential to be a "story stock".

**The Bad:**

They only have a [single public filing](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/press-releases/detail/123/electrameccanica-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial) showing revenues of $0.3 million, and some serious business risks as seen in this [Form 6k](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75713222011490ae5e2206e1c6d9d6a4/electrameccanica/db/370/2784/interim_report/20-34969-1_v003_ELECTRAMECCANICA+VEHICLES+CORP_6-K+-+Draft_7.pdf):

*We have no revenue from the sale of electric vehicles and we will require a significant amount of capital to carry out our proposed business plan to develop, manufacture, sell and service electric vehicles. There is substantial doubt as to the ability of our Company to continue as a going concern.*

**The Ugly (the car if you ask me):**

*We incurred a net loss and comprehensive loss of $29,736,379 and $29,776,051 respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and a net loss and comprehensive loss of $30,742,311 and $30,676,101, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019. Although we had a cash and cash equivalents and a working capital surplus of $101,054,943 and $105,791,318, respectively, as at September 30, 2020, and of $11,095,848 and $15,478,918, respectively, at December 31, 2019, we believe that we will need significant additional equity financing to continue as a going concern, given that, among other things:*

*• we have begun the commercial production or sale of our flagship vehicle, the SOLO, and we expect to incur significant ramp-up in costs and expenses through the launch of the vehicle;*

*• we anticipate that the gross profit generated from the sale of the SOLO will not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses, and our achieving profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to materially reduce the bill of materials and per unit manufacturing cost of our products; and*

*•* *we do not anticipate that we will be eligible to obtain bank loans or other forms of debt financing on terms that would be acceptable to us.*

All that said, the memes might be enough to get it to $20 before it fizzles out.

Good luck if you decide to play it my fellow retards!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lordstown Motors and the Endurance EV Truck Let me tell you about Lordstown Motors, and why the awful name belies a company that has some strong fundamentals.

Lordstown is an electric vehicle manufacturer based in Lordstown, Ohio. They are producing the Lordstown Endurance, a pickup truck that is aiming to be on the market in September 2021.

&#x200B;

**The Good**

1. Lordstown is targetting fleet sales, not consumer sales. This mitigates one of the largest concerns with EV trucks - range - as fleet usage is typically less mileage-demanding than consumer usage.
2. Lordstown has taken over the former GM assembly plant in the same town. Getting assembly up and running is a huge endevour, and purchasing a decommisioned one is sure to shave time off.
3. Lordstown already has 40,000 pre-orders from a variety of fleet purchases.
4. Financing won't be a problem as they just finished a merger with a SPAC, gaining $675 million in the process, so they're sitting on an ample warchest to weather time to market.
5. Their CEO is the former CEO of Workhorse.
6. Their connection with GM will also play out with the $2.3 billion battery factory that that GM is building in Lordstown in conjuction with LG Chem.

&#x200B;

**The Gamble**

1. The Endurance is using a skateboard design. While relatively novel, the design is being pursued by Rivian and Ford. Notably, however, Tesla's Model S is moving away from this skateboard chassis which Musk says is a natural evolution of EV design.
2. The Endurance is using hub motors - this means a motor attached to each wheel. In theory this should mean less moving parts, less weight, and more room on the chassis - something important for a truck aimed at fleet use. The biggest concerns with hub motors is an increase in unsprung weight. This could mean poorer handling if it's not mitigated. It also may be less of a concern for a fleet vehicle.
3. The Endurance is aiming to hit market in September of 2021, this would make it the first fully-electric production EV to market, and critically a year ahead of Ford's F-150 EV. If they fall behind their delivery goal they cede territory to Ford in a market where first mover advantage could be critical.

&#x200B;

**The Bad**

1. Lordstown got hit with a lawsuit over unpaid work on the septic systems in their GM plant. This didn't concern me very much as it pre-dates the SPAC aquisition and cash infusion and they have been in complete agreement that the money is owed and are paying it back.
2. Lordstown also got hit with an espionage lawuit on Friday from Karma Automotive. That name might sound familiar from the Fisker Karma. Indeed, Karma is the successor to Fisker Automotive which was scooped up by a Chinese EV company during bankruptcy. Not sure what to make of this one yet. The judge in the case denied Karma's request for a restraining order and instead ordered both parties into discovery. The whole thing revolves around the entertainment system on the vehicle. Even if Karma wins I don't see it sinking the company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Word on the street is Disney World is planning to build a Robinhood Roller Coaster for the mentally challenged & will be designed by a team of elite retards with Robinhood accounts that look similar to this one right here... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Walgreens: “rapidly expanding” its ultra-cold storage capabilities to accommodate a potential Pfizer coronavirus vaccine that needs to be stored at around minus 100 degrees WSB dd: "tUrNs oUt tHe vAcCiNe nEeDs tO bE rEfRiDgErAtEd lol pfizer 26p 11/20" 

Walgreens spokesperson Kelli Teno told CNN the company felt “confident we can support the successful administration of these vaccines once available."

The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday it is partnering with large chain pharmacies and networks that represent independent pharmacies to help distribute vaccines once one gets authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Don’t keep shoving it all back in. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A little nio today _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apple's M1 chip is a bigger deal than you think. It makes all of apples laptop lineup more powerful than any current gaming laptop. The unified memory is a huge deal that NVIDIA nor Intel can compete with as they offer external chips. The unified memory is what helps Playstation, XBox so powerful - custom built machines, and which Apple is now doing and PC's will never be able to do.

Apple will boost the power on these chips or an upgraded version and put them in their Mac Pro and iMac.  They will become the most powerful desktops available anywhere.

And they improve every year. Nobody will keep up with them. M2, M3.. they are faster than intel at advancing their CPU tech by leaps.

Now the move for most to MacOS from PC is.. difficult and it's hardly going to happen quickly. Gamers HATE apple desktops. But this gap in speed is going to become tremendous, and too much to ignore. People *will* convert. I imagine Apple's GPU will exceed NVIDIA in time. With the unified memory and on chip - GG.

Apple is going to become the premier laptop/desktop company of the world.

This is bad news for Intel, Microsoft, AMD, *and* NVIDIA. Apple is going to dominate with these processors.  This is basically a groundbreaking innovation that nobody seems to care about, and even scoff at, but it's coming. This is huge.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtrp0a/here\_is\_why\_i\_think\_fisker\_fsr\_is\_announcing\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtrp0a/here_is_why_i_think_fisker_fsr_is_announcing_a/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rocket’s CEO is just as confused as us https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/18329713

A lot of us here went all in on Rocket’s earnings report this past week. I was expecting a good report with solid forward looking guidance. Rocket beat all my expectations, and all of the analysts’ as well.

-Revenue up 163%
-EPS beat ($1.21 vs $1.07)
-$1 billion share buyback
-And more

I know that in this climate, fundamentals don’t matter, but it really seems that Rocket has NO reason to be such a stagnant stock. 

A lot of people on this sub like to call Rocket a meme stock, but this is the real deal. Personally, I will be buying more calls for December because I feel that the market has to realize RKTs value eventually. 

It seems that even the CEO is scratching his head following the reaction to the earnings report, according to the article I linked.

Is anyone else wondering why the stock won’t move? Manipulation? Something else?

They could announce a gay color, a new head light, or absolutely nothing. But I am betting it's a new car. There is no way they are rolling into production with only 1 vehicle on the line.

&#x200B;

I'm entering the weekend with $105k of calls. Expires Nov20, Dec18 and Feb. God be with me.

&#x200B;

Why I like Fisker:

\-They have $1b cash and no debt, they will guaranteed make it to production.

\-They have a super cool business model where they lease out the cars for $370/month, and maintain and repair the vehicle for free throughout. No contract needed, user can return anytime.

\-They're saying it's the poor man's Bugatti. Super high quality and good looking.

\-It is going to take at least 2 years for anyone trying to make a new electric car to engineer and certify with government. Fisker already did that.

\-They have a partnership already with $MGA, where MGA owns 6% of Fisker and produces all of their vehicles. This producer built BMW for a long time. FSR still managing the design and logistic process, MGA will crush the development._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSBVoteBot Log for Nov 14 2020 Every time a new submission is posted to wallstreetbets /u/wsbvotebot posts a comment that allows you to click and vote to remove that submission.

Space X is launching its Nasa mission on Saturday, and since there’s a lack of space related stocks SPCE will get some of the enthusiasm. There’s fundamental analysis since SPCE doesn’t earn money but we all know that earning moneys for chumps.

The technical is it’s forming a cup and handle pattern. Go look at pretty pictures of the price of SPCE and follow the volume alongside the price action with the previously formed cups. Keep in mind cup and handle can take different time frames to form. (Refer Investopedia) The first one formed Oct-Nov of 2019, which mooned. After a return fall it formed a bigger cup and handle. The two previous mooned, SPCE also got caught in covid (around feb) which was a bad timeframe in general (refer SPY) Having the pattern before (the second time debatable) is a good sign that it can happen again.

Another thing worth mentioning: WSB is usually right. It’s just most people go all in on weeklies for catalysts that’s could take months to form. (Also having said that I realize the irony of my positions) SPCE used to be a meme stock. Just thought I should let new WSB members know

Conclusion: the fundamentals are aligning with the technicals.This could moon wary in the week before potentially getting FAA approval. SPCE does have a history of accidents, so this could very well go the opposite direction.
