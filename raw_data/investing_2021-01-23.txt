I'm wondering if I'm making a mistake in terms of how I'm thinking it's pretty safe to put as much money you want into 529 plans which are used for education. The way I've thought about it, in some cases, it could reduce the overall income tax burden on investment gains or at least be close to breaking even.

I'll be in the 35-37% federal tax bracket for the foreseeable future. I eventually plan to pass on much of what I've accumulated to my children. So, my thinking is this is what would happen to unused money in 529 plans: If money is withdrawn from a 529 for a non-qualified distribution by the beneficiary (my child who will be in a lower income tax bracket), they would have to pay: 10% penalty on the earnings + whatever % income tax bracket they're in (let's assume 10-12% if they're withdrawing <$40k/year while they are still a student, without income). So then the taxes paid on the investment income would be 20-22%.

On the other hand, if I invested the funds in a regular stock account, depending on trading strategy, I'd either pay 35-37% short term capital gains taxes or 15-20% long term capital gains taxes. Of course, there's more flexibility for what to invest in in a stock account, but if we just use an S&P 500 index fund for both the regular stock account and 529, then at worst, the 529 plan would cost an extra 2% on income, right? If someone's children end up using the invested amount and gains for qualified education costs, then there would be at least a 15-20% capital gains savings.

So even if one is not sure how much college will cost in the future or how much schooling someone's children will end up doing, one should not fret too much about putting TOO much into a 529, correct?

The indices reflected the tech dominance. The DJIA rose just 183 or 0.6% to 30,997, the S&P gained 1.9% to 3,841 but the tech heavy NASDAQ composite jumped 4.2% to 13,543, its biggest gain since the week ended Nov 6th.

The post-election rally of cyclical, value and small cap stocks was built on stimulus hopes and the reflation trade from the Blue sweep; it didn't see as much participation from big tech. When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

**What lies ahead?** 

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity.

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail  are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

# To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that retail loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

Also, do most people lose money in the stock market? I heard a rumour that 90% of people who invest lose. This seems way high and ridiculous given that the average return on the "the market" (aka s&p 500) was around 10%. However, on the other hand, people are overly emotional, greedy, and impatient. They follow the crowd, buy when things are hyped and sell at a loss when there's a recession or on when hearing bad news. Most people are over confident in their abilities, so they won't take the 'safe bet' and end up losing. If most investors are day traders then I can see that most people lose.

Frenetic options trading. A sea of shares sold short. Chat room range wars. Pretty much everything with the potential to slingshot a stock into the stratosphere was at play in GameStop Corp. Friday.

“GameStop is a true animal,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “It’s a rare convergence of a short squeeze combined with some fundamental news and an army of fast money traders.”

If any single fact explains the histrionics, it’s this: GameStop stock equal to 141% of its available shares has been borrowed and sold short, a bearish position showing mark-to-market losses of over $1.74 billion, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. (A single share can be shorted multiple times.) Gains beget gains when shorts are under that kind of pressure, forcing them to buy back stock as it rises.

In the options market, where dealer hedging also has the potential to fuel rallies, a record 913,000 GameStop calls traded as of 3:43 p.m. on Friday, as a showdown between short-seller Citron Research and hordes of Reddit day traders ended with the stock soaring as much as 79%. A bullish GameStop contract with a strike price of $60 expiring Friday was the most actively traded option across exchanges, according to Bloomberg data. It jumped 2,700% to roughly $1.97, from just $0.07 on Thursday.

￼

GameStop’s brick-and-mortar, often mall-based presence has made it a favorite among short sellers for years -- it has rarely left the list of their top targets on the New York Stock Exchange. That, along with its relatively small float, made it tempting for crowd-sourced chat-room cadres who naturally glom to shares trading in the single-dollars.

Which GameStop used to do, but does no longer. At $57, the stock now trades for 50 times annual earnings in the next year analysts forecast it will be profitable -- its fiscal 2023. But trading heated up Friday, with more than 175 million shares changing hands during the session, 21 times the daily average of the past year.

The GameStop frenzy comes after a Tuesday tweet by Citron, in which the short seller wrote that “buyers at these levels are the suckers at this poker game.” That spurred a wave of backlash of the 1.9 million-member-strong Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, prompting Citron managing partner Andrew Left to say Friday that the firm will stop commenting on the stock.

￼

Amid the battle, GameStop surged as much as 116% this week, with Friday’s surge triggering a trading halt for the stock and marking its most volatile 10-day period on record. Shares have rocketed over 200% higher so far this month.

Traders are also chasing those gains in the options market, according to Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy.

“It’s an epic combination of retail traders chasing momentum on a highly shorted stock,” said Murphy, the firm’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Those investors may be viewing the January $60 calls for a max loss of about $2 as a better way to express their opinion than buying the stock for $58.”

* Why are Small Cap index funds doing so well? (I'm guessing small companies are quicker to respond to crisis and opportunity, and raising capital is almost free right now)

* **More importantly**, if I get into these small cap index funds right now, **when should I get out and switch back to large cap**?

* Would you buy into small cap etfs right now?

I have some Vanguard ETFs that I am currently invested in but other than those I'm not too sure what else to invest in. I see myself holding my Vanguard ETFs for probably anywhere from 2 years and over (will most likely hold for a long time), but I want something a little more aggressive and more around the time frame of 1-3 years. If someone could give me some ideas on what to target that'd be awesome, thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Everyone Getting Impatient In This Market? Just for context : 

I am 21 years old. I go to college and also work part time during the semester and full time during breaks. In September, I was able to secure a job that pays well above the standard for a full-time student. Thinking of this as a prime opportunity, I opened up a Roth IRA with Schwab. I am well versed in the world of options and stocks, I have been mainly selling options to make some pocket change since the last year. 

Now, however, I am just passively investing because I feel like putting money into my Roth is my method of saving from every paycheck. I also feel the market is currently overvalued ( DONT HATE ON ME ) so I have been buying RKT only, 168 shares strong so far. Despite these improvements, I cannot help but think that this is not enough. The likes of GME makes me feel inadequate, almost as if passively investing in strong companies won't make me comfortable anymore. 

Despite these feelings, I am too risk averse to invest in meme stocks, so I cannot help but feel FOMO but not do anything about it due to my risk aversiveness. Am I the only one feeling this way, or is everyone getting impatient in this market?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Future of the Short Term Individual Investor: Perspective Piece As the news of massive gains in GME has rocked the investing world, it begs the question: is value investing dead and is a "join a giant group chat of pump-and-dump enthusiasts" the future for the short term individual investor, or at least a small bit viable. 

I'd like to classify myself as a serious value investor, but even I've been enticed to take a small % of my portfolio and hedge my bets with the tik tokers, the discord chats and the r/ the name that shall not be named. 

Personally, I believe we're in an unprecedented new age of investing, with current pump and dump groups way larger and more accessible then even the early digital asset period. Social media, particularly tik tok imo, has united larger and larger groups of investing enthusiasts that jump in on a name dropped stock. I understand this type of group mentality investing has always been there with the motley fool and seeking alpha, but I believe the extent to which has never been this large or this organized. 

I still believe that value always wins in the long run, but... maybe it'd be foolish to not head the direction of the crowd, at least in the short run. 

I'm curious as to hearing your perspectives: has your perception of investing or your investing strategy changed with the run of GME and its underlying social factors?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can I move some money from my 401K to IRA while I already have Roth IRA?

I don't like my 401K plan because I have to choose from a very limited number of mutual funds.

Is it possible for me to open up a traditional IRA account and move some of the funds from 401K so I can pick my own investment stocks?

Would be highly appreciative if anyone could help me out :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Irony of Those Who Trying To Call Market Bubbles Jeremy Grantham, a value investor, [warned his clients that he finally start seeing bubbles forming in parts of the market and it would burst any time soon.](https://www.gmo.com/asia/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/) He lays out many reasons why he sees the ending is near, yet [the interview he did with Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYfmRTyl56w) shines a light that he's trying to time a market bubble just like every retail traders is doing right now.

Irony 1: He calls out SPACs an illegitimated instrument for immature companies going public to raise capitals. Yet, he owns Quantum Scape which went public via SPAC. The company has no plan to generate any revenue until 2024-2025. I'm sure he has been rewarded handsomely, but being an early investor has restricted him to sell shares to the public until lock up expiration. So all he can do right now is watching his investment goes up and down in wild swings.

Irony 2: He is an advocated green energy investors. He has called out Tesla a bubble, which many by the time now know. He was wondering why the market hasn't taken notices to his green energy investments for 10 years. That was until Tesla showed up of course. The fact of his EVs' and other green energies companies' valuation are going into bubble territory is exactly because of Tesla's leading the charge. Perhaps he should sell some of those investments if he thinks those are in the bubbles as well?

You have many other examples. Even legendary investor Warren Buffet, who advocated "Be greedy when others are fearful," was very fearful just like every other human beings during the COVID crash in February & March of 2020. Berkshire was not executing its strategy and sold many of its holding at rock bottom. If Buffet was brave at that moment like he did during the financial crisis of 2008, I'm sure Berkshire's stock would outperform the market by a large margin by now.

Moral of the story: Listen to what people said, **but pay attention to what they actually DO.** No one knows when the bubble may pop. If you're thinking long term, just stay the course. You will ride through bubble pops and still come up on tops in the end if you're investing in good companies.

If I want to avoid the capital gains and I’ve already maxed out my Roth IRA would the following strategy work? 

1. Sell the index fund stock I own in my Roth IRA
2. Sell OTM puts worth $1000 in my Roth IRA for the same index fund that I sold in step 1
3. Buy the same put for a cost of $1000 in my tax account

My thoughts here is if the stock goes down and I get assigned the shares in my Roth IRA, that’s fine I got paid to be invested in an index fund for a lower price than I already was. My puts in my tax account are now worth more than $1000, I can just rinse and repeat steps 1-3. If the stock goes up instead of down then the only downside is I miss out on the gains that I could have had in my Roth IRA.

I made a post suggesting that cloudflare was overvalued and got shot down. Fair enough, lets take a look at another.

Now I am valuing Shopify based on the feedback received on my Cloudflare post.

SHOP has seen 100% revenue growth YoY the past few years, meaning it is growing at a faster rate than NET. SHOP also has positive earnings which is a plus, and will likely grow with the revenue.

P/E Is over 700 but that doesn't matter. P/S Is 60, 60x revenue seems to be the sweet spot for high growth, and considering cloudflare is 70x, that would make SHOP slightly better value.

I'm not sure what exactly to do with this amount of money other than to keep this past 10k or so I just collected in cash so that in the event tuition rises, I don't have to worry about making payments.

Given outrageous valuations for companies like Carvana, I think RMBL is WAAAAAAAAY undervalued.  The thing is, no one seems to know about it and languishes with tiny volume and large spreads between the bid and the ask (due to the low float).  

I view RMBL as a speculative bet.  Their financials are so/so.  They don't have a long history yet.  They are trying to figure out the balance between growth and profitability.  Still, in a market that is bidding up any and all speculative names (GME, RIOT, MARA, Expr, anything tied to EV, you name the SPAK), I don't see how Rumble On has not caught a much bigger bid higher.  

Would welcome Reddit dialogue on this stock and thoughts as to where it could be in the next twelve to 18 months.  While again, they are not a Carvana, the valuation or Carvana is through the roof, while Rumble On just can't seem to get any love from anyone.  Welcome other ideas to speculate with if RMBL is not for you.  So many names have ran up so high, it's hard for me to buy anything with out being scared it might collapse.  Still, the market is so much fun right now.  I traded back in 1999 and it reminds of then, but is far more bullish even now.
