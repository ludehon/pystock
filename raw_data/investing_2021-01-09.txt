 Are Gold & Silver stocks like miners etc a forgotten market? Posted in r/stocks but had to move it: 

We cant deny that at the moment we had a great bullish run. Yet with stimulus probably going trough and inflation going trough the roof: what happened to the gold and silver market which is assumed as a safe heaven? It’s been a long time i’ve seen a post about it in here.
Does anyone here have positions in gold or silver, miners, etc?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Been seeing alot of posts with questions like "Are we in a bubble?", "Could this be like 1999 or worse?" , "We haven't had a correction since 08-09 so aren't we due?", "COVID-19 is on the rise, could this be the catalyst for a pop?"... Invest in the future, not next month! I'm seeing a-lot of comparisons going on to the bubble in 1999 with the crazy valuations going on.  Furthermore, I see the same things like 08-09 was the last time we had a serious correction and increasing Covid cases with the weakening dollar could be the catalyst blah blah blah.  Who the hell cares?  This fear mongering of what might happen tomorrow is some shit i'm tryna leave behind in 2020.  The bigger picture here is that our very landscape has changed in the last 2 decades and we have to stop being scared of change and fear of a correction.  Can it happen?  Sure, in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term?  No.  Here's a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10-20 years ago...

We live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood, acorns, or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor.  The result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy.  Coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors Millenials and Gen Z, do not own a home and/or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market.  What's interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions.  This seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint.  However, with the rise of 401(k) benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans, millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story.

We live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity.  The historic rise of ETFs approx +6,000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor.  Employers are increasing 401(k) benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits.  The rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like.

We live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search.  Trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor.  Things such as cloud computing, AI, Genomics, blockchain, green/renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren't going away anytime soon.  Access to social media, blogs, investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding.

Who knows what the next 10, 20, or even 50 years will bring?  I don't know but i'm certain that **change is here to stay** so stop worrying and embrace the unknown.

While I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think it's important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10-20 years.  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it.  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is, and always will be, the worst mistake you can make.  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest.

Who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10-50 years?  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it.  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that - heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls!

Edit 1:  Been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so I want to clarify a few things about what i'm tryna say here.

1.  I am not saying invest heavy into Technology/Clean energy or any of the other crazy shit that's been popping cause it will stay that way.  I am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 10-20 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology.  What will the next 50 years bring?  I don't know but i'm excited to find out.
2. I am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now.  You'd be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing we've been doing.  The M1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble.  Invest smart, look for value, average in, don't buy into the hype/FOMO, you'll be setting yourself up for some losses.
3. My post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money.  A lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now.  I am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market - look what we have done in the past 10-20 years as a nation and as a global population.  It's fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop.  Think long term always as a new investors, you're young and can handle losses.  I saw a comment on another thread saying "take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest" and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run.  Investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting.
4. Stop calling me stupid/naive it hurts my feelings lol.  I'm a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and I want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future.

Cheers!

Edit 2: Thanks for Gold!

Again, please just take this post at face value and not for what it isn’t.  In no way shape or form should this be taken as financial advice or recommendations as everyone’s situation and appetite risk is different.  You can nit pick my post for what it fails to cover not consider blah blah blah.  My point is plain and simple - there’s a lot of worrying going on right now in the market but investing for your future is the best thing you can do especially if you are young and haven’t started._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Green / Alternative Energy ETF's -- Very successful recently, appear solid long-term -- any downside? I've always been interested in green/renewable energy like solar, wind, etc., ever since my dad (Physics) taught a course in them back in the 70's.  I love the idea of not only protecting the planet, but reducing our energy costs once proper infrastructure is developed.  (Because wind/sun/tide/waves etc. should ultimately prove easier to tap/harvest than oil/gas is to locate, obtain, and purify.)    


It seems inevitable that governments world-wide will start taxing carbon more heavily fairly soon in an effort to address concerns about global warming.  (Whatever one personally believes about climate change.)  With or without simultaneous tax breaks / credits / subsidies for Green/Renewable Energy (which are also likely), this should cause Green Energy to become cost-competitive with oil/coal/gas, and perhaps even \*more\* profitable.   Meaning Green Energy companies will also become far more profitable.   With constantly improving technologies only increasing that viability/profitability.   


The main problem with this sector is picking individual winners and losers.  (See:  Solyndra.)   There were dozens of auto companies in the U.S. at the start of the 20th Century, but only a few survived by the end.  Green/Renewable Energy ETF's would appear to address this problem through their inherent diversification.  By buying into an entire sector (or sub-sector), we can benefit from the likely rise in the green/renewable energy sector, even if only some of those companies actually flourish.  (Buying a number of different sector ETF's will also help diversification, of course.)  


With this thinking, I purchased various such ETF's in early 2019, including TAN, QCLN, ICLN, and SMOG.  These were picks for my retirement, decades away, and I wasn't expecting much in the short-term.  However, all of them have at least doubled over the past 2 years, and some have quadrupled in value.  All without any U.S. carbon taxes, or major favorable treatment for renewables.    


It would appear this is a very solid investment area that will almost inevitably flourish unless humanity destroys itself in the next 20-30 years, or aliens arrive and give humans an infinite/cheap energy source.   (Hopefully, if cold fusion is developed, that company will be included in one or more major ETF's.)  


These would therefore appear to be no-brainer investments in terms of long-term investing (10+ years).  And I would therefore recommend them, generally speaking.  However, I do have a couple Q's:  


1.  Why do people think these ETF's have taken off so much over the past 2 years, when the current administration has not been a proponent of carbon taxes, etc.?  

2. Can people see any way that these ETF's \*won't\* do well over the longer term?  Aside from the two more "Sci-Fi" scenarios I cited?  I do realize that atomic power will probably have to be part of the energy solution in the future, but people will probably prefer to support/consume cleaner sources where possible.   With atomic energy also a renewable that people could get ETF's for._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing Thesis: Iran to Achieve Great Economic Growth in the Next Decade So everyone's talking about Tesla, PLTR and Bitcoin.  However, I think there's something that no one is paying attention to. Iran.  I'm pretty bullish on Iran and I think in the next decade we will see big growth in Iran.  Four Reasons:

* Young Population
* Green revolution
* End of the regime
* Educated population

1. Iran has a really young population, average age is 28.  This is peak age and is  great for economic input.
2. Iran is quite reliant on oil.  A switch to green energy will see less reliance on oil and a switch to green energy.  This may lead us to see something similar to Saudi Arabia in Iran. In the last 5 years Saudi Arabia has changed phenomenally due to a fact MBS knows that they cannot rely on oil forever thus need to modernise the economy.  We have seen more change in 5 years than the last 2000 there.  We could see the same in Iran.
3. The 'Supreme leader' is old and he does not attract young support. Research shows that Iranians, especially young ones, are relatively liberal and progressive.  Eventually the Supreme Leader is going to die and his support will die out.  The regime is NOT sustainable.  This leads to my next point...
4. Once the regime has fallen Iran can get the best out of their citizens.  Iran have a very talented and educated population.  This mixed with a young population is a great mix for a good economy.  However now due to the reigme Iran aren't doing themselves justice as a nation unfortunately.

Overall, these four points together are a great recipe for economic growth in the next ten years in Iran.  Iran is a country with great economic potential that is being hostile to a 7th century regime.  Because of this, it's definitely an area that warrants further research and potentially investment.

I've been researching this for a while now, but unfortunately I have not kept all of my source material.  There's some interesting videos on YouTube where Chamath and Raul Pal echo the above arguments.  If anyone wants to know more, ask, and i'll find you some sources.

I am seeking out some beaten down VALUE stocks in today’s market to round out my portfolio. Throughout my research the only sector that I’ve found to contain some tickers that aren’t outrageously priced are REIT’s. Obviously these are risky with COVID still in full force, but I believe them overall to be still undervalued (exceptions being FCPT and SPG). REIT’s I currently hold include KIM, MAC, and WSR.

Is there a book or at least a list of all strategies and financial instruments that are available to you as an investor? I’ve recently been studying hedge funds and read about Bill Ackman’s March 2020 trade where he made huge gains by buying Credit Default Swaps - an instrument I didn’t even know existed. 

I would love to learn how to hedge with options and so on.

My question is, is it normal to take profits from these  funds and reinvest them if (when) the fund drops in value by x%?

What I'm currently thinking is whenever a fund shows 20% growth I will take 30% of the value out and make a note of the current growth value. If that goes up another 20% (so 40% from first trade) then take another 30% out. If however it drops 10% (so 10% up from first trade) I will put any cash I've skimmed from that fund back in. Is this even a common strategy and if so what is it called?

The only thing I haven't accounted for is if a fund grows and grows and never drops the 10% I will end up with a load of cash on the sidelines and missed plenty of gains._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Motley Fool Services vs. Podcast With the Motley Fool podcasts, I’m able to get some good stock ideas and find out some of the picks from the fool for free.

Got into investing recently and I'm trying to find the best free portfolio tracker to use. I tried SigFig, Seeking Alpha, Sharesight, and my broker's tracker, but none of them had exactly the features that I want, and I'm starting to question whether such a tracker even exists. What I find absolutely necessary is:  
\- a way for my cash position to also be represented (my biggest issue with Seeking Alpha)  
\- the ability to see and track separate tax lots separately  
\- current, no-delay position tracking (somehow, Sharesight was giving me delayed data for NYSE, but I don't know if that was a fluke)  
\- an easy-to-see graph showing how my positions (individual or together) moved over time

In the ideal world, I would also like to have:  
\- automatic dividend tracking  
\- some relatively decent-quality news/alert service (but I get that's a long shot).

I'm very willing to live without the last two, though. What are your suggestions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do people not take into account technology and advancement when it comes to investing? I  keep seeing the same thing. We are in a bubble, look back at 2000, look back at the Great Depression.

  
Does no one take into account these facts?

&#x200B;

1) Technology has made investing almost instantaneous, and the investing world will grow over the next decade at an unprecedented rate. I  know random idiots using Robinhood, that would never have bought a stock if they were born 30 years prior. The market is so much more liquid now, and with more participants, more money is being exchanged.

&#x200B;

2) Technology has also increased the rate of acceleration a business can have. We have multiple TRILLION dollar businesses and more coming, back in the 1970s did we have any? Money is easier to make now, you can literally press a button 3-4 times on your cell-phone and start making money. It is not like it was before.

&#x200B;

3) Technology has allowed us to enhance the free-market to a level that has never been thought of, and again it will grow at an unprecedented rate. It's so easy to spend money now, literally takes a maximum of a couple of minutes. The transfer of goods and services is INSTANT, this was not available even 25-30 years ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ALL I  seem to read is people treating the market, and business operations as if it's the same as it was 30-40 years ago and it is not. Just like transportation went from horse and buggy to sending people to the motherlovin' moon, why do we not comprehend that technology has advanced the market and investing. I'm not saying SPY 2000 and DOW 100000 in 5 years, but I'm saying the comparison isn't the same.

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021.  It's Total Addressable Market is 300B. \[2\]\[5\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries. It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen. ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\]\[6\]. This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now. The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery. What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery; or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings. Picture the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge. Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note: blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel. green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\]. Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells). They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\]. So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035.  Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.  And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

I'm trying to do some research about the current environment vs the dot-com bubble. I understand there are some major differences (such as the rate/inflation environment, the easy retail access to trading, Twitter/Reddit, high frequency MM environment, more access to financial news, etc.) but to me, the dot-com bubble is the closest I can think of to the current environment. 

I have a very fundamental question that no one has really given me a detailed answer for that I would be curious to see if anyone can shed some light/discussion on (especially r/investing since I know some of you are experienced enough to have traded back then and might still be holding on to CSCO jkjk). The question is why did the dot-com bubble burst and in particular, what made March 2000 special. 

The answer I always get is "valuations were overstretched...fundamentals caught up...people locked in profit" but that was the case for 1998 and 1999 too. That was the case for January - February 2000 too. But the bubble only popped in March 2000. Why March 2000? What was special then? Did people see any signs in Jan - Feb 2000 (even in retrospect)? That's why question and any discussion would be appreciated. 

I'm also curious to know what the sentiment around certain stocks were (even with no Twitter/Reddit) and the volume of trading. In particular I'm interested in stocks like QCOM, CMGI, CSCO, INTC, the non-tech names like WMT and PFE which were big then (were they lumped together or did they rotate like today?), and also the great survival stories like AMZN. 

I also made a more technical post on r/options about this with the link below (interested in the data and also described some specific companies like comparing TSLA to QCOM of 2000), but obviously I don't want to get into that technical details here on r/investing.

I am wondering, I have been looking into and seriously considering investing in rural land as I have a dream to live out in the middle of nowhere in the American Southwestern desert area and just being able to walk around naked. Would it be feasible to purchase a hundred or so acres, keeping a 30 acre plot for myself and then selling of the rest (in a variety of plot sizes as land access and utilities permits)? Ideally I’d want to sell them after about 10 to 20 years, but I understand that one possible outcome would be ending up with a few unsold or unsellable plots.

Dude that knows little of investing..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In light of recent success like Plug, Tesla, Fuel, etc., what signs could one have looked for when investing? This last year has been insane for stocks. My stocks managed to climb to about 110% (which is a big deal for a new High School teacher), but I just can't help but feel like it was complete luck.  I just invested in companies that were related to things I care about (Energy innovation, mostly). As we move forward into 2021, which could either be a great year or a popped bubble, I'm trying to figure out how to identify solid investments since my gains from last year weren't necessarily well researched.

In particular, I'm talking about things like merger arbitration, spin-offs, recapitalisation etc.

I've recently finished 'You can be a stock market genius' by Joel Greenblatt and he describes various situations where the smaller investor can profit by taking advantage of the way institutional investors behave during events like spin-offs. Essentially, he argues that by reading through the submitted documentation for these corporate actions one can spot good value bets that institutional investors avoid. However, the book was written in the late 90s so I'm wondering if similar situations crop up now.

My own personal hunch is that the market inefficiencies that produced these situations in the 90s have dried up now in the same way as merger arbitration went from being a good way of making a profit in Ben Grahams day to a risky enterprise by the time Greenblatt was trying it.

Any thoughts or opinions welcome._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding investment time horizon A big consideration for determining an appropriate asset allocation is the time horizon, which I always defined as the length of time you plan on holding that position.  I think investment discussions break down a bit with 3-6 year time horizon strategies.  If you need to use the money invested after 6 years, the allocation in year 1 may need to look very different than in year 5.  However, I often see the discussion in terms of stocks/ bonds mix over a 6 year period as if the allocation time horizon is constant over those 6 years.  How do you frame the allocation discussion for time horizons of 3 years vs 6 years?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What headwinds does SoFi face over the next 5 years? After Chamath Palihapitiya announced on Thursday that his fifth SPAC would be taking SoFi public, I began researching/skimming the investor presentation and really liked what I saw. SoFi is expecting unique members to grow 75% in 2021 to 3mm, which based on the last three quarters is a reasonable assumption. Additionally, they are projecting $1bn in revenue for 2021 with a note that if they receive a bank charter revenues could potentially hit close to $4bn by 2025.

One of my initial concerns is the bloated valuation of ~$16bn based on the current price of $IPOE, PIPE shares, founder shares, and warrants. When looking at multiples, it is definitely a premium vs. similar competitors such as LendingClub / LendingTree. However SoFi is unique as it has other revenue streams outside of lending so it is hard to find a perfect competitor. 

Overall I think SoFi is a solid company when you combine all 3 business segments - however I am not sure what’s stopping other banks from eventually building out their own 1 stop shop for all personal finance needs. What do you guys think?

If a warrant is trading above 6.5$ and the main stock is worth more than 18$ at a merge.

Once the warrants become exercisable(30 days after merge), we may redeem the outstanding warrants...   at a price of $0.01 per warrant; 

  if, and only if, the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period **commencing once the warrants become exercisable** and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders .

&#x200B;

Do this mean from day 31-60 after merge, there is a window to sell the warrant before they force a redeem at 0.01$ per warrant.

Thx for the help_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you like to handle all-none’s and potential reverse splits? For sake of an example:

NAKD went down as far $0.12 a share and currently trades at $0.34 a share. NASDAQ gave them until May to get their share price above $1. 

They could do a reverse split to achieve this. 

If you’re an investor who likes to take shots on all-none scenarios and bought say 200 shares at the low of $0.12, how do you like to play this?

Do you sell it now since it’s up, knowing there’s a reverse split coming sometime in the few months?

Do you just ride it out longer trying to get more out of it?

Or do you truly go all-none, just letting it sit even through the reverse split?

Every day I come across an article in the FT or Bloomberg saying that as soon as interest rates are raised, Govt's will have to stop the stimulus / furlough payments and Banks will not be able to continue handing out mortgage payment holidays. If this happens, I feel it would be likely that banks will have to start collecting on interest and capital owed and as a result there will be defaults and then a domino effect whereby lenders cant pay their lenders and etc. All this residential debt is also packaged up with commercial debt (which we know is extremely bad due to commercial shops refusing to pay rent during lockdowns)


As for stocks companies wont be able to borrow money as easily and will have to pay more on the debt currently taken out, meaning there should be a pullback.

Or comparisons. Basically I’m just curious about some specific historical questions I can’t readily find the answers to in general overviews of the market and market crash of the period:

1) Were there bank stocks in the 20’s as there are now for retail banks. For example, was there a stock for (the original) Wells Fargo Bank on the market, or is that a newer phenomenon?

2) Was there a sector of the market or a group of stocks that first started showing signs of weakness before/during the crash. Was the drop in prices relatively wholesale, or did certain specific sectors start to show dramatic weakness and spark panic across the board?

Hi, I can only find one ETF in the UK that’s shorting Tesla (3STS) x3 inverse.

Does anyone know of any ways to short this madness that’s 100% certain to come crashing down soon? Looking for ETFs in the US market.

What would be a good options play? I’ve never bought options.

Rationale for this position is of course that Tesla is beyond insanely overvalued. It’s a company that is NOT making money if you disregard the EV credits, and Elon Musk, as bright as he may be is not the second coming of Christ. 

There’s so much EV car competition right now and anyone who’s worked in software and tech knows that whenever there’s a tiny bit of improvement somewhere, the competition is quick to catch up. That will of course also happen with Tesla. Give it a few years and we are there.

Then there’s the autonomous vehicles argument, taxis etc etc. All it’s gonna take is a few lethal accidents and there will be regulations in place to kill that business.

If cars didn’t exist today and someone came around and said “let’s make these 4000 lbs metal boxes with wheels on them, make them go 100 mph in opposite directions and we’ll just draw a line between the lanes to prevent accidents everyone would laugh and tell him he’s out of his f’ing mind. So.. nah.

I also think people think that when they are buying TSLA, they’re buying a piece of Elon Musks brain, and also thinking they’re gonna be consolidating all his businesses under the Tesla umbrella, like starlink and space x, neurolink, boring project etc. Nope. Not how it works.

Therefore, time to short. But where, and how?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which bonds to buy? Questions from Europe  Hi all!

I have a couple of questions I want to consult the hivemind on.

Situation: 30+ years to normal retirement age, living in an non-Eurozone EU country, Poland. I earn in the local currency, złoty. Inflation projections for Poland are comparable to the US - around 2-3% this year last time I checked. I don't anticipate the złoty appreciating much vs major currencies for the foreseeable as the government is likely to keep the country cheap and competitive.

Retirement accounts: I can invest around 6k USD per year combined into two accounts, IKE (no capital gains tax, post tax, 4.5k USD annual limit) and IKZE (no capital gains tax, tax deductible, 1.5k USD annual limit). The annual limit is related to the average Polish salary which is around 1.5k USD per month- I'd happily put more in.

Poland's retail investment market is still quite immature but has improved significantly in that I can hold these accounts in a brokerage and buy international stocks and a broadish selection of international ETFs. The brokerage is the cheapest available and charges a minimum of 8 dollars per trade or .29%, whichever is higher.

Given the above I want to keep my trades to a minimum. My desired asset allocation for these accounts is 80/20 equity/bonds. As regards equity I'm using a european equivalent to VT. Bonds are a question mark; I'd like them to function as a hedge/stabiliser to the equity portion and, ideally, not depreciate. Here I have a few questions:

\- **I'm earning in a third, minor currency. Does it make sense to invest in USD or EUR denominated bonds at all when considering currency risk?** I can buy individual polish government bond issues through the brokerage but I'd rather buy an etf because . Alternatives considered include holding 20% in cash in the accounts (zero interest, yuk) or buying gold. Given the nature of these accounts I want to max them out - I can't hold 100% equity and pump in funds from elsewhere to rebalance.

\- Funds considered include:

[AGGH - global, diversified, big cheap, and hedged.](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/291770/ishares-core-global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf-fund) EUR denominated

[TIP5 - US TIP fund.](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/287202/ishares-tips-0-5-ucits-etf-fund)USD denominated

My view would be that if I'm buying US TIPS then there is some currency risk between the złoty and USD but none for the bonds themselves. Picking TIPS i'm likely to have decent ballast and maintain position vs. inflation but lose diversification and potentially return, with long term inflation rates a question mark.

With the global fund I'm more diversified. I may get better returns that may be lost due to currency hedging and may as a result actually see a negative return in the coming years.

To make more money, I issue stocks. But that stock 1) doesn’t have voting rights 2) doesn’t pay dividends and I say im not planning to pay them in foreseeable future. As my company grows and becomes more profitable, people start buying my stock, to sell it to other people at a higher price, and price of my stocks start climbing. I start issuing new stocks, and in total I make hundreds of millions of dollars from selling my stocks alone. Then i keep running my company, and say that I will never pay dividends in the future, and will not buyback any stock in the future (or I don’t say and act to just don’t pay any dividends and paybacks). This will result in a crush of my stocks price, but it makes no difference to me since I already made hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock. I keep all that money, and I don’t need to payback anyone. While all stocks my stockholders hold become worthless, leaving them penniless. I effectively scammed my investors out of millions of dollars, using a Ponzi scheme, and I didn’t break any law.

What prevents me from doing that in a stock market?

For example, you cant do this in bonds market, because you have to payback your investors at a certain time with certain interests, and if I don’t do that, or cant pay what I promised, I get sued, all my property will be sold off, and I face criminal charges.

This is something I have been thinking about for a longer time. It seems to me that simply looking and following fundamentals of a company does not make you the most money. The market is driven mostly by sentiment. Atleast that is how it seems to me, but I only started trading in 2020.

I'm sure there must be something I'm missing or haven't put together yet. If you could help me understand that would be awesome._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ USA - migrating a tumultuous future. Hi there,

We've all seen the events in the USA and I'm curious what people's plays are to weather the situation. 

As someone living in the USA and having almost all of my assets placed within the country, I'm curious what others would do to improve the stability of such investments.

What's your play?

I made a 'professional' Reddit profile, but it's brand new so I can't post here, so plz excuse my older generic one.

Going to be a bit of a longer intro post, **BLUF: The absolute best place to be investing if you expect big stimulus and some degree of inflation is shipping. Including a YouTube link to a webinar I hosted in early-December and happy to answer Qs.**

**Background / Recent Trades:**

Here's some bio stuff so you know I'm not wasting your time.

I run an independent research shop that focuses on deep value investments, particularly the maritime shipping space? Remember #tankers? Floating storage and all that? Before $NAT and $FRO became wild stocks on YouTube, the trade was launched here:

[**Biggest Oil Price War Winner: Crude Tankers (13 March 2020)**](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331589-biggest-oil-price-war-winner-crude-tankers)

Been writing on Seeking Alpha for 10 years (since Summer 2011) and launched our boutique research platform in mid-2015. We now have the largest research team in the sector and over 500 members and affiliates. Shipping is an exciting place to be, both for traders \*and\* investors.

More recently have any of you been on the restocking/containership trade? $CMRE $DAC $GSL $NMCI

**$NMCI has went from $0.80 to $4.41 in just over 3 months. 451% return in 3.5 months**. Move over $TSLA $ZM $PLTR and the dozens of arguably even worse ones like $CVNA $DASH $SNOW. There are fundamentally cheap names with the potential to move also...

So you know I'm not inflating, here's a full PDF of our original research post on all these names posted to [our research platform](https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_316) on 13 September 2020:

[**Link to PDF Report on Containerships (13 September 2020)**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqm5mjixp7qde1q/Containership%20Update%20-%2013%20September%202020.pdf?dl=0)

*I didn't take a single share off $NMCI until a very recent 20% trim at $4.44 as the position was becoming an inordinate part of my net wealth. These aren't theoretical or 'model' profits, particularly on that name. I admittedly exited $DAC far too early though... $CMRE has been a late bloomer, but those calls though!*

**Sector Thesis:**

I believe shipping is strongly positioned for 2021. Stimulus will further boost all the tailwinds already causing containership stocks to soar especially if Asian countries follow suit on their own projects! Furthermore, inflation will lead to surging asset valuations. These stocks are moderately levered, so assets surging means the equity grows 2-3x faster yet. Most of these names got destroyed in 2020 because common sense says "Global Pandemic?! Sell Shipping!" However, consensus was entirely wrong and several shipping sectors are earning record profits now and set to do even better in 2021.

**Discussion & Some Picks**

I'm reaching out to see if anyone is interested in any of these names and talking some shop.

Our top 2021 picks and model portfolios are up 16.4% in the past 7 days versus the Russell 2000 up 6.8%. I think we're just getting started, but of course we have to see what happens!

Sorry everyone- long post. Again, **TL;DR: The absolute best place to be investing if you expect big stimulus and some degree of inflation is shipping. Including a YouTube link to a webinar I hosted in early-December and happy to answer Qs:**

Few ideas I've publicly mentioned (including reviews in that webinar):

* Dorian LPG (LPG)
* Flex LNG (FLNG)
* Navios Containerships (NMCI)

Note: I am personally long LPG, FLNG, and NMCI. I am both long and short TSLA in varying strikes. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VALE and TSLA What’re the odds that the nickel mining company that Elon Musk said he would give a ‘very big contract to for a very long time’ for mining nickel is VALE? Are there other plausible options of company’s he could be referring to? I’m curious which company he may have been taking about and VALE was the first to come to mind_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rights Offering Advice  Hello,

I  am a shareholder of $PW and they are providing a non-transferable  rights offering at a \~35% discount to the current market price. This is  my first occurrence with something like and was wondering what others  have done in a similar situation? Seems like a good deal given the  discount, but from what I read seems like the price is bound to drop  when the new shares go live.

Thanks for your responses!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TOS: Overall Totals vs Net Liquidating Value Somewhat of a newb, but I noticed there is a significant difference between my "overall totals" in ThinkorSwim and my "net liquidating value".  I totaled it up and it's clear that my overall totals is the sum of all my "mark values".  So what is the net liquidation value?  Is that how much I "net" if I sell everything and pay capital gains taxes?  I'm confused because there seems to be around a 3K difference between my overall totals and my net liquidation value.  

Thanks for any help you can provide!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where to find all US public-traded companies? I remembered that Buffet said once that he reviewed all the US-listed companies when he was young from a Moody’s manual published every year. And that manual contained data and multiples like P/E, P/B ratio, etc.

Thus, I am wondering is there still anything like that Moody’s manual nowadays? If so, where can I find such books or website that contains such information including company industry, sectors, multiples, etc.?

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SMICY help So I was stupid and didn’t do all my DD when I bought SMICY in several of my accounts (401k, Roth IRA, and individual) and didn’t sell them before the delisting. I contact my broker and was told that I need to open an account with a non US financial institution and request a transfer.  Currently I am in the green (a little) with it. Looking for some advice on here. Which financial institution I should open with and the tax implications? 
I’m also aware that when Biden takes over he could potential reverse the delisting. 

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Margin of Safety vs. Timing the Market Would waiting for a margin of safety be considered timing the market? Correct me if I'm wrong, but waiting for a margin of safety means waiting for the price of the stock drop below its intrinsic value before purchasing it. Essentially buying the stock on sale. However, in order to do this you need to WAIT for the stock price to fall. Wouldn't this be considered timing the market? What is the exact difference here?

I am amazed at the insane valuation of Tesla. It does not make sense.

I am considering shorting Tesla, while limiting my downside risk. Say I am willing to lose up to $5000.

Looking through the options chain, June 2021, strike price $600 PUT premium is around $50. I would buy this PUT.

Measures to regulate big-tech are being discussed. Will these things affect the outlook and stock prices of companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple negatively?

Does it have any effect when it comes to short or long term capital taxes when the underlying shares gets sold 1 year later?

if no, what if the shares get called away 1 year later?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for good mutual fund and stock visualizer Hey everyone, I’m curious if anyone has a go-to online tool (or even better if there’s an app) where you can graph mutual fund performance, ideally being able to add 5+ funds at a time and graph along with SP500, NASDAQ, etc. Bonus points if you have something where you can create a profile and look at saved graphs whenever you want! Would love any advice, thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Invest in sailboat charter Hi, I plan to invest 25% of my whole current net worth (build in the last 2y) buying a sailboat and rent it to a charter operator in Greece. I'm currently 27yo and I expect an increase in tourism after all these lockdowns. I expect a 20 to 30% net return per year. What do you think? it's a risky business? I already managed to discuss with a charter operator and I will pay them about 30% to be hassle-free and treat this as annual passive income (more hassle-free than a home rental)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to make sure portfolio is diversified with large-cap and mid-cap funds? I am in my early 20s and I am looking for mutual funds to invest in for my Roth IRA. From my research I have found a few large-cap and mid-cap growth funds I think I like. 

The mid-caps are HAMGX, ARTMX, and BMDIX. 

The large-caps are FBGRX, EGFIX, and TFOIX. 

Since some of these funds invest outside of their market cap would it be a bad idea to put 50% of my portfolio in one of those mid-caps and the other 50% in one of those large-caps?

I am also finding it hard to compare funds since I feel that many annual return figures are currently inflated since the market is at a peak._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Relatively Safe Short Market Investments I have some money invested in stocks through my Roth currently and plan on taking the money out in the near future to put it in a self directed IRA for private lending. Are there any relatively safe investments that I should look at? I don’t 100% know when I will need the money and hate to have it earning nothing by taking it out. I also don’t want to gamble by staying in risky stocks. Even if it was some short term bonds earning 1% or so would be better than nothing.

Side note. This is not my only money so I’m not looking to play it so safe that I don’t earn anything. I’m strictly looking for low volatility short term options.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
