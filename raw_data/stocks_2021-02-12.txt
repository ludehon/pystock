For the past decade genetics has been undergoing a veritable revolution, with rapid advances resulting most recently and spectacularly in the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19.  I think that in the next few years the stocks for genetics corporations will consistently outperform the market; in the past month on Robinhood alone I made over 30% investing almost entirely in genetics stocks.  On the whole, over the next decade and probably more, genetic and biological technology has a lot more room for relatively rapid advancement than weed companies (its just crop after all) and Tesla that get a lot of interest on Reddit.

The website below lists IPO's in genetic technology that you might want to look into:

The only thing I am confused about it is how are people holding these swing trades for a couple days. 

It seems to me that most swing trades dip below the SMA line within the day, and you only have three day trades per week so I am very confused about how to go about swing trades that i can hold for a couple days. 

If anyone could help i would appreciate it thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BMBL Bumble stock thoughts? Hey I was just wondering what you redditors and some of the experts here thought on the stock I see the IPO was just recently released starting at $75 a share.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Future AI stock C3.AI is an AI stock that had an IPO in December. Although it came running out the gates at full speed, it seems there is already quite the demand for it even though it hasn’t had much publicity and I haven’t seen anyone talk about it. Market cap of 15B. Although earnings have been negative so far, revenue is growing and I think once their products become well known, they will start to turn in a decent profit. There’s no denying AI will have a big role in the future. Imo this is a long term hold and there is even a good opportunity of a swing trade in the short term. Has anyone looked into this company?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRON is Undervalued Wondering since this all public information, and no one is pumping CRON w/memes, and it's not in news (Altria=pros, very quiet), why **Altria controlling CRON is really not a huge deal**

March 7, 2019 - [Altria announces 45% stake w/1.8B investment](https://investor.altria.com/press-releases/news-details/2019/Altria-Becomes-Largest-Shareholder-in-Cronos-Group-a-Leading-Global-Cannabinoid-Company/default.aspx)
 45% now, 1.8B investment w/ABILITY TO SPEND 1B MORE TO GET 10%.  They had 4-yr window to close...tick-tock.  Altria already planted board members...and will close deal likely after the announcement by Chuckster.  [He signaled it here n Feb 1](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/-booker-wyden-schumer-joint-statement-on-cannabis-reform-legislation).  

Zero doubt at all....Altria and the PM (PhilipMorris) lobbying machine are hard at work.  [Confirmed here in this CEO interview from Jan 22, 2021](https://ir.thecronosgroup.com/events/event-details/cronos-group-24th-annual-cibc-western-institutional-investor-conference)

 "Cronos Group has no U.S. operations, and cannabis remains illegal at the federal level." - it claims in the press release.  Altria/Cronos Group are planning as one unit, but giving the appearance of 'nothing to see here' while they know it's a sweetheart deal

Altria distancing themselves, but w/1.8B already invested, board members seated, Marlboro lawyers fighting in Washington.....and guess who has all the distribution across the USA?  PM/Marlboro Guys.  In every convenience store.  Those reps have all the areas covered, distribution in place...I bet all of that is being planned while the lawyers help Chuckie and his pals craft a bill.  And those remaining Republicans that are too old-school to want it legal?  Bankrupt governments everywhere to consider.  Businesses paying taxes??  Balanced budgets were a thing of the past - they need $$$.  Excise tax on weed.  The public pressure after SchumSchum bill announcement will sway them.  And they'll paint a rosy picture.  Pros, them cigarette guys.    

Drafted, passed, & then signed by Biden. All Dem controlled (they do need a couple Republicans still!)  Altria spends the remaining $1B - Plug and play, now it's weed and they are going to DOMINATE. 

And if your brand is popular locally...they go buy out the owner, make them rich and streamline ops and now it's them and not the OG.  Consumer is none the wiser, now that's Kools, or is it Winston?  They've been buying up the brands everywhere,  they have the distribution, THEY KNOW HOW TO MARKET ADDICTION......all they need is the law changed - then with $1B more investment - Altria-controlled money-maker JUGGERNAUT.

My bet is on the experienced and the money.  Gotham is back.  [Altria's website says "MOVING BEYOND SMOKING" - they know](https://www.altria.com/)

Just to name a few tickers you've got - [Insert Ticker]. Lucid Motors another one that is being bought out and is garnering interest but there seems to be an elephant in the room.

Do investors not realize that there is existing brands that will most likely make EV solutions? You are already seeing it happen every big car company has a "Hybrid" or "EV" solution in the works or in production.

Tesla was the first true "creator" of the EV car but it will not be the last but does everyone really think Mercedes or BMW will suddenly stop producing cars? California already banned gas cars effected 20XX. Do investors really think everyone is going to buy a Tesla once this happens and Mercedes will stop producing cars for this market? NO! Every existing gas powered car will create a EV to satisfy the market needs.

All these prices seem to point that Tesla and CO will take over the EV/Auto industry in the next 5-10 yrs but does everyone honestly think this will happen?

I do not know if its just me but it seems silly to me that people honestly think that the average consumer will purchase a new [insert ticker] car over a proven Mercedes/BMW solution. I know on a personal note any luxury European branded car has a social status associated to it. Do we see a this shifting in the next couple of years?

Do we really think there will be a world where someone will prefer buying a NIO car over a BMW?

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Finding Innovation Early (and Reaping the Rewards) We have definitely all seen the power of truly innovative companies with excellent vision. This is especially true if we as investors are able to identify these companies before the market at large does. Take Tesla, for example. After a decade of market doubt, the stock nearly 10x this year alone. This is not a fluke, as Tesla is not (entirely) driven by hype. Their long term goal, execution, and product is second to none, and they are being rewarded.

Today, there are more areas affected by innovation than ever before. Industries converge and solve problems exponentially faster as time goes on. Over time, innovation will displace the status quo, increase efficiencies, and gain significant market share. We as investors can place our money with conviction knowing that, no matter where the economy is short term, disruption is inevitable. It is up to us to recognize the opportunities and invest in disruption. By doing so, we can position ourselves at society’s cutting edge, reaping the rewards along the way.

But what drives innovation, and how can we find it early? While every situation is unique, I believe two key factors to keep in mind are **Leadership** and **Mission.**

Before we analyze a company from the lens of innovation, we first have to be sure we will derive value from our research. Go through the following checklist:

* Is the company something I understand, or something I can easily learn about?
* What is my personal feeling of confidence with my research? And finally,
* Write down what the company does and the problem they try to solve in less than one page.

Chances are if you can't do that, you need to reevaluate 1 and 2. This is fundamental when placing money in any investment, but a step many overlook completely. Ensure you have a firm understanding of the company and a justification about why you allocate your money towards it. This is especially important with highly innovative companies in their early stages of growth, as the market may not reflect its future value. Now that you are confident in your own knowledge, you can consider assessing the company for disruption.

**Leadership**

A company's leader has a profound effect on what can be accomplished. Not only do they steer the focus and the allocation of resources, but they have a dramatic effect on a company’s most valuable asset: human capital. Human capital, which comprises the habits, knowledge, creativity, social and personality attributes a workforce possesses, is the defining factor in a company's success, and the larger the aspirations, the more vital it becomes. But how does a leader communicate their vision and attract the best employees? Ones that want challenges, to solve hard problems, and risk failure? Charisma.

In the book The Charisma Myth, Olivia Fox Cabane outlines the four main charisma styles—focus, visionary, kindness and authority. Focus charismatics make people feel heard, respected and understood. Visionary charismatics move people with their passion, conviction and vision. Kindness charismatics emit warmth and show acceptance. Authority charismatics project great power and confidence, forcing those around them to obey.

What type of charisma does the leader of the company you are evaluating have, and does it align with the company mission? In order to find this, watch all the interviews, press releases and other media that feature the CEO. Pay attention to their attitude towards doubt and competition on social media. Furthermore, look at the company's past goals, have they kept promises and attracted others that share their mission? Make sure to check employee reviews, determine whether employees are happy and believe in the company.

**Mission**

The next place you should look when evaluating a company is their mission. Does the company solve a profound problem, or reimagine a now complacent industry? An article that I find useful to reference when asking this question is “[Requests for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)” by Y-Combinator. As you may imagine, these requests touch on some of the most widespread and complex problems we face, such as climate change, education, and healthcare. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, but a good place to start.

Do they dare to solve a problem thought too big, too far away, or too unprofitable? I would argue that with the right leadership and human capital, any problem of this type is solvable, and faster than we may imagine. Progress is not linear. This is because of Wright’s Law, which describes how progress increases with experience. It states that the cost of each unit produced decreases as a function of the cumulative number of units produced. Think of the television, batteries, or cellphones. When we evaluate a company, this exponential growth may not be immediately intuitive, but is incredibly powerful nonetheless.

While we should be careful not to be blindly speculative, looking for charismatic, driven leaders solving our planet's most profound problems will pay off greatly as an investor.

This is not an exhaustive guide, but a great place to start. Let me know what you think or if I missed anything_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good Options for Stock Investment Apps Hi everyone.

First, I didn't know how else to word my title. This isn't directed at any of you individuals who post DDs on r/stocks and similar subreddits. I applaud all of you who put in that work and are willing enough to share research with the public. Literally none of you have the obligation to post your findings, and could just sit in the shadows making gains while many are none the wiser.

With a lot of drama circulating reddit investors, especially those on WSB, I've seen extremely mixed reviews about pretty much every mainstream media outlet that posts or streams news on upcoming trends, market movers, undervalued stocks, etc. The first instance that comes to mind is when news lines tried to draw attention away from GME and throw Silver in the limelight.

So I guess my question is whether or not there are analysts or news outlets that broadcast information for the benefit of the viewer. Do analysts and reporters who broadcast their findings to the public for large companies exist simply to try and bring hype into the stock that they're promoting? Are they just a giant pump and dump machine? I could be looking at this the wrong way. 

In my heart of hearts I'd love to believe that there is market information publicized for the benefit of the retail investor. Does such an entity exist outside of reddit?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

Since January around $180 billion have flooded in. Now that this capital is in the system, it can be redeployed to seize emerging opportunities quickly going forward.

Chart Showing Record Inflows:
https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1360218720765759492/photo/1

The massive inflow of new capital will continue for a few weeks as new accounts are opened. Soon the size of new capital ready to be deployed will exceed $200 billion. 

The market cap of meme stocks is small by comparison; GameStop's current market cap is only $3.6 billion today. If any of this money pours into meme stocks it would put significant upward pressure on share prices. Even if just 10% of the capital flows into something like GameStop, its share price would be back near $350.

A recent survey showed that 28% of Americans bought viral stocks in January. A similar portion might be interested in buying into similar opportunities going forward.

It is essential that New York’s marijuana legalization law includes the following core consumer-centric tenets:

The legal option for adults to cultivate personal use quantities of marijuana in private residences;

Reduced barriers of entry for those seeking to participate in the legal adult use marketplace;

Provisions facilitating the automatic review of past criminal records and for the expungement of those records where the past behavior is no longer classified as a criminal offense;

Provisions prohibiting employers from discriminating against workers in the practices of either hiring or firing solely because their off-the-job cannabis use; and

Dedicated funding of social and retroactive justice initiatives through Community Reinvestment Grant fund.

Never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation's nearly century-long experiment with marijuana prohibition. According to statewide polling data, 65% of New Yorkers endorse regulating the adult use of marijuana.

Please support efforts to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana in a way that ensures safe, affordable, and equitable access for all New Yorkers."

Late 2019 I decided I wanted to start investing and took about $1k and threw it into various things. Then the crash happened with covid and it made me nervous, so I held off. In May I started testing the waters and bought one share of Zillow (Z) for about $51. It's now trading at almost $200. And this is a similar story for a handful of stocks I hold. I only bought a few shares, now they're much higher than when I bought them (CHWY and HOME for example) 

My goal with investing is to hold these long term. So, ideally, I'd like to hold onto them or buy more. But my question is: if something like Z is up almost 200%, do I wait until it goes down to buy more? Do I put more money in and hope it just keeps going up?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts for all of these new investors. Open to other's thoughts too! I've had approximately 25 years of investing experience with stocks. I used to work for a business which pushed micro cap stocks and I had to call brokers to try and have them pick up some. Didn't work there long.  
Over the years I've lost maybe $10,000, until recently. About a year ago, upon COVID coming about, I noticed stocks drop like crazy. I recall this occurring back in '08 also. And prior to that around 9/11 time. So this time I was ready with some cash, which was the problem before since I didn't have much disposable cash. I invested in two stocks which were very low in comparison to highs and both were recent IPOs. One was Funko ($FNKO) and other $LMPX. Made about 6 times my money and pulled out of $LMPX since didn't like them anymore, but they helped give me great profit. I'm still in $FNKO.  
Overall I'm saying all of this to say hang in there for those who lost money. Make sure to set aside some money for the next big dip.. I could have invested my money better a year ago, but I did well.

Be ready for that next time the market crashes. It will happen! Until then study up and research. Also spread money around in investments. Putting faith in one can burn you big time.

I'm always learning.. so open to others thoughts, tips, and tricks. I just recently understood warrants and options better. Warrants sound interesting. Would like better access to IPOs. But all I have is ClickIPO currently. So if anyone knows an easy way to access IPOs better then I'm interested.

Best wishes!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The bull case for Raytheon Technologies I have not seen too much conversation around RTX so I wanted to put in my ideas around the company. The company is a mix between military technologies such as missiles and radars and commercial systems such as jet engines and aircraft parts. While the commercial sector has suffered in the short term, the military sector had not as the government is still buying many systems. Since rtx js split between these two areas it will allow it to be insulated from the losses suffered from more commercial crocuses companies such as Boeing while also being able to take advantage of the recovering aviation industry._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pharmacy sector investments I work and have insight into the pharmacy sector and wish to share some common knowledge.

Retail pharmacies have now been granted access to distrubution of covid-19 vaccines. This is huge for the business due to increased attention to pharmacies, foot traffic to stores and overall image to companies. CVS, Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid(RAD) have the potential for some nice short and long term growth and recovery due to this introduction. 

Due to covid-19 Amazon was able to buy into delivery of medications which allowed consumers to avoid drug stores bringing value down. Couple that with elective surgeries being cancelled and the average person avoiding hospital visits and you had a steep decline in prescription counts. Now we factor in customers switching their maintenance medications(blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol) from 30 day to 90 day automatic refils and you are seeing 15-20% declines in pharmacies.

CVS has an earnings update next week(Feb 16th). Wallgreens(WBA april 1st) and Rite aid(RAD April 15th)

CVS earnings will not reflect the impact of covid vaccines but WBA and RAD certainly will.

The value of the vaccines supersedes other sectors because it cannot be purchased and administered online(Amazon).

As the federal government continues to work with states to allow private sectors involvement in the vaccination of the entire country(world) the value here is unprecedented.

Tl:dr covid vaccines hit retail pharmacies this week and will provide massive growth unscathed by online outlets which have previously destroyed retail. Expect coming growth as the entire country prepares to vaccinate._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. (This post has a lot of sources but in order to push this through I've had to remove most of the link, you can pm me for sources if you'd like)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist. Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is covering using synthetic long shares or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started withreading SEC Regulation SHO which deals with naked short selling. “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**.

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "**phantom" or "counterfeit" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling".

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when RHood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at RHood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between RHoodand Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of RHoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to RHood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars. So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.”

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.”

"It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**.

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”**

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a Redditor brought up: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for input on moving from ETFs to Mutual funds in Roth IRA Just looking to see if anyone sees any disadvantages to making this move or if there are any other suggestions to improve. I've been looking around a bit and have not been able to make the case a solid case for either other than the price point per share  and a small decrease in expenses.

For context I am 28 and currently hold VTI (90%), VXUS (5%) & VNQ (5%). I've been looking at making the possible moves below.

VTI >> FZROX 

VXUS >> FZILX

VNQ >> Into an undecided fund possibly another real-estate fund or maybe into another zero expense fund from fidelity which are: Large cap (FNILX), extended markets (FZIPX), or even open to other suggestions.

My long term money is mostly in index funds for retirement and my kids college. Like an idiot I jumped on the meme train late in the game but didn’t invest anything i couldn’t lose. But dipping my toe into more active trading does have me thinking, as I’ve got a chunk of cash just sitting in my savings account. I am not confident in picking stocks after the sting of GME and AMC. So now I’ve tossed a little bit of $$ into arks. Obv more risky than like VTI, but like damn, those returns tho. Right now I have ARKQ, F and G. Not a huge investment. 

Thinking about putting a bit more into them, maybe like 15-20% of the money I’ve got just sitting around. For context-  I’ll prob be needing to sell my current apt and buy a bigger place in a year and a half, so my time horizon is about a year so I have the money for a bigger down payment.

I've also decided to put aside a bit of money to invest in Roblox when it has its direct offering (hopefully) next month. But between a bit of boredom and the impatience of waiting for Roblox, not to mention the fact that this is the 3rd time they've been delayed, I'm thinking about doing some short-term trading to try to make a bit of extra profit to throw towards my eventual Roblox stock purchases.  


But I'm at a loss as far as good sources for short-term trading. I'm not looking for someone or somewhere to tell me what to buy, but someplace that will help me figure out which stock to do my own research and due diligence, because I'm getting overwhelmed trying to figure out even where to begin. Especially because I'm not looking for penny stock or GME hype to get rich quick. I just want to find some things to turn a small profit on while waiting to invest in Roblox, and maybe even try my hand at some day trading.

Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.

So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG & LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.

**1. Positions**

[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO & XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.

\- NFLX: \~10

\- ABNB: \~28

\- PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)

Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets

\- TM: \~0.8

\- F: \~0.4

\- VWAGY: \~0.5

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct >20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you’re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?

NIO: 100% SUVs

Xpeng: 40% SUVs

Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking “Well, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.” Fine, let’s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.

Let’s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs

Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800

\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s

\- Charger network: 20,000+

NIO EC6

\- Price: \~$57,200

\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s

\- Charger network: 290+

Xpeng G3 520

\- Price: \~$30,580

\- Range: 520 km

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s

\- Charger network: 866+

You may be thinking the G3 520’s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you’ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.

“But JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It’s perfect for China’s dense cities!” If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That’s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I’d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can’t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I’m Chinese and know some first hand) don’t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.

Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

“But JJ… China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!” Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.

Solar & batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn’t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.

Oh and let’s not forget about autonomy… no, let’s forget about it (for now).

International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a "made in china" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.

Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it’ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was "made in china" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).

Let’s look at the current state of margins.

Q3 2020 Gross Margins

\- Tesla: 23.5%

\- Nio: 12.9%

\- Xpeng: 4.6%

\- Li Auto: 19.8%

We’ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it’s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla’s solar & battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.

“But JJ, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

2015: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.

\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!

\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.

[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)

Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?

\- Tesla’s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.

\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.

\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources

\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network

\- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*

\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn’t trust Nio and Xpeng’s software with your wife’s boyfriend’s life

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’ve done some DD. I found stock I like and have purchased. I’ve made some gains %10-15. Now what?

I'm looking for some help regarding my $75 2/19 calls for VRNT that I purchased prior to their spin-off with CGNT. Currently, I have VRNT1 calls (with a certain broker) which include 100 shares of VRNT and 100 shares of CGNT. These calls are in the money because the combined price of VRNT and CGNT is about $81 at the time of posting. However, the bid-ask spread is very wide, which I'm attributing to certain brokers not allowing the purchase of VRNT1 calls. The current bid on these calls is $3 which is atrocious since the profit per share is $6 if I exercised them right now. The issue is that I don't have the money to exercise these options in order to just sell them back and profit.

I'm not entirely sure what happens at 2/19 EOD if the calls are in the money but I don't have the money to exercise them. So, I'm wondering what to do. Do I deposit more money in my account and borrow on margin to exercise 1 option at a time and then just sell the individual shares?

I tried watching several YouTube video tutorials on the subject, but the people explaining have said both good and bad things about the subject.

I am working on an investment report and analysis for family office as a client. I asked the company I am doing the report on for some information and if they are willing to share. I didn't ask for anything exotic. They have a shareholder table published on the website but don't keep older versions there. I have asked if they are willing to share them for the recent quarters with me, as I couldn't get a full picture on my own.

&#x200B;

I have sent an email asking on 5th of February and didn't hear anything back so far. No confirmation of reception or if they will look into it or whatsoever. Is this usual or is this already quite slow?  It  gives me an unwell feeling about this company and thinking about reconsidering my choice.

&#x200B;

It would be great if someone has experience in speaking with IR from companies, what usual times are and so an.

It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Starting point Hi I want to start investing in stocks as well.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19) Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry this is wrong in the title). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom. Would love to know all your thoughts as well.

**What Does Palantir Do?**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade
   * The remaining 80% is available to trade starting February 19th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

I have been playing stocks with a strategy of attempting to pick the next big thing, like the next google or amazon before it gets popular.  I realize this is high risk so I limit what I 'gamble' but i have been having pretty good success.

I started doing this in late 2018 with $30k and it is now worth $267k. What I think will be big are the following markets:

Space: TSLA. SPCE, AJRD

Renewable energy and Batteries: SEDG, ENPH, TSLA, BEP

Self Drive cars: TSLA, APTV

Genetic medicine: EDIT, CRSP, SRNE

NOBODY wants to work in an office again: CRWD, AMZN, WMT

Those are my current focus areas. Those are the primary stocks I have been buying in those areas to get my gains over the past few years.

P/E of 588, a forward P/E into the 200s, is this even real? Are earnings going to grow by 200% year on year to justify this forward P/E. Is square stock in a bubble? If not, why not?

Do you feel the people that were pumping tesla to the moon have jumped onto square? I realise it is a good company in a growing industry, but what company do you know that deserves a P/E over 500?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point ... Should it be done? Ok   guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and   modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not   accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**   we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't   noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly   more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth   more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with   massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that   Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock mooned in the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,   it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that   there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really   think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically   everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of today.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

CIBC, Bank of America, UBS and TD Bank stand accused of coordinating “abusive” naked short selling and spoofing strategies in US and Canadian stock markets by a Bermuda hedge fund that claims to have lost tens of millions of dollars as a result.

Harrington Global Opportunity Fund has filed a suit at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that various US and Canadian financial institutions, through their broker divisions, manipulated markets and drove down pharmaceutical company ADVANZ PHARMA’s (formerly Concordia) share price in 2016.

The specialist pharmaceutical recapitalised and rebranded in 2018 after being embroiled in a long-running dispute over apparent price hikes and accusations of mismanagement by its founder and CEO Mark Thompson, who stepped down in 2016. 

According to the suit, the defendants, which include several unnamed US and Canadian individuals, allegedly flooded the market with false sell signals by simultaneous naked short selling — in which the trader does not borrow a stock, or determine that it can be borrowed, before they short sell — and spoofing — a form of high-frequency trading that artificially inflates perceived demand of a security — which created millions of ‘phantom’ shares.

These practices violate the US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and Regulation SHO. 

The result, Harrington suggests, is that Concordia’s stock price tumbled from $34.77 to $1.83 over 11 months.

According to the complaint, Harrington sold 9 million Concordia shares on US and Canadian markets, including the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange, in response to the defendants’ alleged illegal market manipulation.

Harrington is seeking damages, legal fees and interest. 

It is alleged that in 2016 there were approximately 238 million shares of Concordia stock that were sold short on the Canadian and US exchanges, constituting around 58 per cent of the approximately 410 million Concordia shares traded during the period in question. 

However, Harrington argues that only 40 million shares were actually issued for trading, meaning the short sale turnover rate was approximately 600 per cent.

“The enormous discrepancy between the 40 million shares issued by Concordia for trading and the approximately 410 million Concordia shares traded during this period represents an astonishingly high turnover rate of 1,000 per cent,” the suit states. 

The fund alleges that a “strong inference can be drawn” that these figures were inflated by “millions of fictitious shares unlawfully manufactured” through naked short selling.

Lawyers for the plaintiff told SFT that no court date has been set.

None of the financial institutions featured in the complaint wished to provide a comment for this story.

If bumble’s valuation is true at \~$8B, given the market share, then Match’s true value should be $27.36B, so $103 a share given their # of outstanding shares. It is currently sitting at $167.

If matches valuation is more accurate at \~$44B, then bumble should be worth \~$12.86B given their 3.4x less market share, so about $120 a share given bumbles outstanding shares.

Match’s P/E is 86, which makes it seem like it’s might be overvalued right now, but they reported really good 2020 earnings, and had really good growth in apps outside of Tinder.

My hope is that I can provide a more-complete picture of what an educational post should look like, so we can set a standard that can be used (and potentially turned into a sticky of educational/rules posts, mods???)

You might say "shut up old man, this is not important."  But it is.  You see, WSB has cucked everyone with the you-know-what-company fiasco.  The SEC is not cool, and they are **coming for us all**.  That means new regulations on shit. That means more fiery hoop hurdles to trade options and higher "account value" thresholds for day trading. **We must demonstrate that our community is not harmful to the general public by providing them with accessible educational materials.** This clearly matters to the SEC and FINRA because they force the banks to provide educational materials!

DFV was a cool cat, and [if you watch his original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U) about you-know-what-company, you will see the type of in-depth understanding that successful active investors have. Spoiler alert: it can't be boiled down to 10 commandments.

With that said, let me boil down successful active investing into 10 commandments.  Please make recommendations about additional information (with source links please).

1. These commandments are not complete!
   1. Your journey is not over after knowing these rules (or any others). Beware [the Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), continue to seek knowledge from [credible sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/166ha8/what_are_rinvestings_favorite_books_future_side/), and ***talk to someone if things seem grim*** (pour one out for our homies that we have lost in misunderstanding, recently). Published authors aren't perfect, but they usually provide a broader picture because they are genuinely experienced (unlike many Redditors).
   2. Remember, at the end of the day, the laws of Supply/Demand and Cost/Utility will [act like the blades on a pair of scissors](https://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html?chapter_num=31#book-reader) to determine prices of all things, including stock. Since nothing can predict human behavior perfectly, nothing can predict price perfectly.
   3. Fundamentals and Technical Analysis be damned; at the end of the day, it's how much is being sold for how much, and how many people are willing to buy (for whatever reason) for how much *on that specific day* that will determine a spot price. (You can use [Level 2 Quotes](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/level2quotes.asp) to get at this information.)
2. [Volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) is king.  This is true *always*; you must be on the look-out for volume (and, more dangerously, a lack of volume). If a stock doesn't have enough volume, you might not be able to sell any/all of it at the "spot price" you see. Remember that volume is relative to share price, though-- 1 million shares of $10 stock is the same as 10 million shares of $1 stock in terms of real value.
3. "Know what you are buying." Every internet parrot loves to repeat this adage. Let's talk about *what it means*:
   1. You should understand the company's [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp) by looking at its [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/031004.asp). Usually the founder of a company contributes very little money; then they sell parts of the company to investors ("equity" which will simply become shares down the road) or they get a loan from a bank. **Understanding the split between loans and equity is critically important to "knowing what you own."** Loans are better because that means there are fewer shares, so each share you buy owns an even bigger portion of the company. This is difficult to do, because banks are weary of unprofitable businesses. Note: the shares available at your brokerage are *not* the way the founder sells equity (usually).
      1. In addition to basic loans and equity, you should be aware of any [convertible notes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/senior-convertible-note.asp) (loans which become shares) or [convertible preferred shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblepreferredstock.asp) (hidden shares which "activate" later). This can massively affect the valuation of a company. You can find this information [in their SEC documents](https://www.sec.gov/). To find out about preferred shares, you might need to look at their "declarations" which are linked at the bottom of [10-K's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp) (but not [10-Q's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10q.asp)).
      2. **More on convertible preferred shares because they are that important (esp. to penny stocks):** *Sometimes, convertible preferred shares own a set portion of the company (i.e. 65%), no matter how much they dilute in the meantime.* This protects early investors, so they always retain control of the company. It allows them to dilute further (to raise more money for operations while non-profitable) without losing control of the company. **You cannot just look at the Outstanding Share number to calculate a company's valuation.** When you calculate numbers that use these convertible notes/shares converted all the way out, the numbers you're calculating are called ["fully diluted."](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullydilutedshares.asp) They should be the only numbers you really care about, because at the end of the day *that is what you are buying.*
      3. **Not all shares have voting power** and those that do are inherently worth more.
   2. You should know how long the company can sustain its current debt burden given its current operating income / velocity (i.e. its [burn rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/burnrate.asp)), and have some idea of where they are going to get more money if they run out. If they issue new shares, your position will inherently lose value, because they are [diluting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) it!
   3. On the topic of dilution, be aware of how many [Outstanding Shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) have been used up out of the available [Authorized Shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedstock.asp).  Keep in mind that those sneaky convertible notes from above *are not accounted for* in these numbers!
      1. Lots of people get suckered into buying up a stock that is inevitably about to perform a [Reverse-Split](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversesplit.asp), because the company is running out of money and has no way to raise new money except to issue and sell new shares (diluting). But if they have used up all of their Authorized Shares, a Reverse-Split will allow them to "reset" the number of shares that have been sold and sell even *more*, which *massively* dilutes their company. **Remember those early investors with preferred convertibles (the ones who are voting) will not be affected by this.** They don't care if they devastate new investor positions.
4. Know what you *aren't* buying.  Just as important as knowing about the company you are invested in is knowing about their competitors in the same industry.  If you're looking at a company that sells Widgets, and every other company has a Price-to-Earnings ratio of between 8 and 12, but *your* company has a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 30, one of two things must be true: either your company has a potential future revenue stream that the other companies do not, or the company is hugely over-valued. **Performing an industry analysis is tedious but critical; if you're not interested in doing this, see Commandment 10.**
5. Decide on a [Risk Management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp) plan for yourself which **should include, at a minimum, what** [**Asset Allocation**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp) **you are comfortable with and an** [**Emergency Fund**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergency_fund.asp). To go one step beyond the Investopedia article, you should also decide how you want to allocate your Stocks between Penny Stocks and large-cap, Blue Chip stocks. Your allocation doesn't need to be reasonable to still offer some level of protection.
   1. When your portfolio moves wildly out of balance with your desired asset allocation, rebalance it.  If you have a penny stock that just 10X'd, you should be selling some of it to rebalance into other, safer areas--even if you have a 90%/10% allocation between penny/blue chip, reallocating will help you protect your profits from disaster.
6. Take advantage of no/low brokerage fees and **place more-frequent, smaller orders** This advantage was conveyed, for a long time, only to the wealthy, and now it's available for everyone. If you're interested in entering a position with $1000, consider setting up 5x $200 orders or 10x $100 orders to enter at a more advantageous price.
   1. On the other side of the coin, if you think you're ready to take some profits -- go ahead and set 5x or 10x *sell orders* and take profits at differing price points.
7. PUT MONEY IN A **SAVINGS ACCOUNT** TO [PAY THE TAX MAN](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets).  Seriously, I know you are thinking "but I could *invest* that $10,000 and turn it into $40,000" but you could also end up having your wages garnished and your entire life turned upside down for years to come. Do not fuck with the IRS.
8. Pay attention to the management. A good leadership team is critical to a company's success. It's not the whole picture, but it's another important part of the picture. You should also **pay attention to what management is doing with** ***their*** **stock**, which is reported as [Insider Buying](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insider-buying.asp).
9. Learn about [Options](http://reddit.com/r/options).  I am not going to talk about options thoroughly in this bullet point, because it's an entire branch of finance that has numerous resources dedicated to it. I want to say that there are *tons* of strategies out there that can help you with either aggressive or safe investment strategies. Remember risk management!  Pick a balance between aggressive and risk -- one that you can live (and eat) with. In this subreddit, this bullet point will likely apply to your "safety" stocks that you keep as a part of your allocation, i.e. selling [covered calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) to add additional safe/steady profits.
10. Consider a safer alternative in [Index Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp).  Some people choose to do this as part of their Asset Allocation because they just enjoy trading stocks.  If you're not willing to put in the real work (including, for example, taking finance classes) so that you can truly understand what you're investing in, you are far *safer* picking Index Funds.
11. You can still pick Index Funds that are in the industries that interest you; these differing funds can have radically different returns which can still give you the joy of investing without having such massive risk.

Again I cannot emphasize how *little* this prepares you for a life of attempting to be an active investor, especially in small cap or penny stocks which have tons of hidden little features like expanded upon in note #3.

So let's all collectively start trying to provide more comprehensive educational materials that provide links to external, verified sources-- it will be important to show the SEC and FINRA that we are *not* encouraging people to partake in risky behavior, but instead genuinely putting our *best* foot forward, and not the one that has the least reading/thinking required.

Not sure how many of you are following whats going on in container and bulk shipping...? But, it may be worth your attention as they are going from strength to strength.

For those of you that haven't been keeping an eye, container rates have gone through the roof due to a bottleneck in the container market met with increased demand for consumer goods during the pandemic (ie. containers are logjam and can't keep pace with demand as people order more goods from China/amazon). Similar, there is a huge amount of demand for raw materials as countries make their way out of the pandemic with government stimulus. Much of this demand is currently being driven by 'Chinese Special Bonds' (ie. more cheap money for infrastructure/raw materials).

In the handysize vessel segment alone, day-rates have now surpassed 2011 highs. This trade should continue for a while as more government stimulus is pumped into the system, central banks keep rates low and countries begin exiting lockdown/pandemic. There is a huge pent up demand and big infrastructure projects underway. Just look at the Biden administration's environmental agenda! A good way to get exposure to the upside in shipping is buying companies with handysize fleets. Due to the parcel size of the non-ferrous metals, handysize vessels are the best fit for non-ferrous transport.

An added bonus in Handysize at the moment is the fact that the fleet is aging (which means the oldest of them get scrapped) and the orderbook for new builds only makes  some 2% of current fleet. It takes 18 months (at least) to build a handysize so its not like the market can get flooded one day to the next. Demand currently far outstrips supply!

I would recommend that everyone has a look at the segment. Not all alpha has to come from brick phones and movie theaters....

As soon as this rule was executed, the stock started going back up to $3.7 (as of now) from $2.80 in the first 5 minutes of the market (before Rule 201 was imposed and it was going down hard with heavy volume \[aka short sellers\]). This means that there are more bulls than bears behind this stock, right?

Since I am planning on keeping my position open for the long run, I want to make sure if my understanding of what happened today is right. What do you think?

As another example in contrast to this one, the same thing happened to AEZS on Feb 9 or 10, after a spike in price. But this time the price kept going down, meaning that the price was too high even for the bulls. Is that a correct way to think about this? I appreciate your feedback.

Thanks for reading_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Infrastructure Plays for Biden's Build Back Better plan Clean Energy and EV have slightly stagnated and dipped recently as focus has shifted away back towards recovery plays. However, I believe the focus will shift back to the clean energy sector once Biden's relief proposal is passed and he prepares to unveil his Build Back Better plan which a large portion of will be " **to build a modern** [**infrastructure and an equitable, clean energy future**](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) " He has stated multiple times that he wants a "2 part" recovery where the first part is the current ongoing discussion on relief and stimulus, while the second part will focus on building a clean infrastructure for the future.

This includes industries such as infrastructure, auto, transit, power, and agriculture. Many clean energy plays are down \~5-10% from their peaks earlier in the year so it may be a good time to get in before the focus shifts from relief and recovery to infrastructure. 

While EVs and solar have been discussed extensively here, I've seen less on plays for infrastructure including transit and building renovations. To me, the big players that the U.S. government would make deals with for this plan would be large auto companies and energy companies like IEA, BEP.

So, the popular opinion was that when the new administration took over this year, that clean energy stocks were going to rally in a big way, and oil was going to suffer. But even as Biden gives speech after speech declaring his commitment to clean energy, day after day, oil stocks keep outperforming, and clean energy stocks / etfs get slaughtered (I'm looking at you, ICLN & QCLN).

Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around? Or is it an unintended consequence that squeezing big oil produces more scarcity in the commodity due to production constraints?

Did we just expect too much too soon in the clean energy space? What's strange is that pot stocks are (ahem - *were*) up huge on the expectation of nationwide legalization, even though that's far below clean energy on Biden's list of priorities.

If I can free up more money, I’ll likely buy more shares. I’m not a professional advisor, and this isn’t advice.

**TL;DR** – covid recovery + management + new wins + awesome dividends = a great ROI

**What is $NCMI?** – National CineMedia, Inc. ([https://investor.ncm.com/](https://investor.ncm.com/)) – they are the largest cinema advertising network (e.g. the ads that play before a movie in the theater). They have an exclusive arrangement with 57 leading national theatre circuits, including $AMC, $CNK, and Regal Entertainment (sub of LON:$CINE).

**Ownership Structure**: It’s interesting that $NCMI actually operates its business as a joint venture with $AMC (0.9%), $CNK (25.1%), and Regal (26%), with $NCMI owning the remaining (48%). This means that the theaters have a vested interest in the advertising wing being successful (refer to page 25 of the December 1, 2020 Investor Presentation).

A few other reasons why I believe that $NCMI is undervalued:

· **COVID Recovery:** I believe in the thesis that as the country receives the COVID vaccine throughout this year, consumers will want to return to movie theaters – this business is primarily dependent upon a return to theaters, and we’ve seen support for that thesis – e.g. $AMC successfully refinancing their debt in order to preserve cash flow this year. This assumption is key to the recovery of both movie theaters in general, as well as $NCIM

· **Management:** I believe that the leadership team is highly capable and their significant experience in the industry will enable a rebound in short order. The CEO, Thomas Lesinski, has been on the Board since 2014, was made CEO in 2019, and previously worked for Sonar Entertainment ([https://sonarent.com/](https://sonarent.com/)), Paramount, and Warner Brothers. The rest of the team shows a deep bench too

· **Recent new business win not tied to theaters:** This week the company announced that they entered into an agreement with Ziosk to entertain guests at restaurants. If you’re not familiar with Ziosk, hop on over to your local Olive Garden and you’ll see that Ziosk is that thing they put on your table that you unavoidably look at and use to pay your bill. Ziosk has >150k screens on tables at restaurants, and as we see a return to restaurants post-covid, the recovery that $NCMI experiences won’t be limited to just theaters. This is particularly interesting, because as we see the covid recover, we should think about $NCMI’s growth not being capped by theater activity. Even with some theaters closing, their content will still be on more screens because of the deal with Ziosk (see announcement here: [https://investor.ncm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/national-cinemedia-ncm-and-ziosk-team-entertain-restaurant](https://investor.ncm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/national-cinemedia-ncm-and-ziosk-team-entertain-restaurant))

· **Short Interest:** I considered excluding this, because the data around short interest is opaque at best. While the % short interest was not incredibly high, given that this name doesn’t see a high trading volume, it would take a number of days to cover the position. Now, based on the activity that has recently occurred with $AMC, my guess is that the HFs have closed out most of the short positions before it could be squeezed, so this may be a non-factor. Also, any squeeze that could potentially occur would be limited in nature. However, I do believe that the meaningful short interest over the course of 2020 helped drive the value of $NCMI down, just as they did with $AMC – you can see the correlation for the period commencing around March/April 2020.

· **Downside Mitigation:** $NCMI has a history of paying healthy dividends. If you think about it, this makes sense given that it’s >50% owned by theaters, and they view this as a means to capture some of the value from their ads space. Although the dividend was cut recently, as soon as the business starts coming back to movie theaters, we’ll see the dividend pop back up as well. If you’re an investor like me who can stomach not seeing any capital appreciation or dividends for a year or so until we start seeing that recovery, you’re looking at a solid business that can yield a lot of dividends. In 2018 and 2019, the company paid $0.68 in dividends. Assuming that they could get back to that same level of dividends by 2022, at the time I’m writing this (pre-market 2/12/2021), with the share price of $4.12 on 2/11/2021, that would provide a 16.5% dividend yield. Even in 2020, they were able to manage an 8.3% dividend yield. The real question is: how long will it take to ramp business back up to pre-covid levels?

· **Further Analysis:** I haven’t built my financial model just yet, but that will be the next step and I’m hoping to do that next weekend and post an update with more # crunching to prove it out in greater detail.

I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about.

And for **full disclosure** even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: **I do technically own some INTC** but it's only **2 shares**, [yes 2 shares](https://imgur.com/a/vv3Yi6k).

So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first.

\-----------------------------------

# Cons

Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one:

\- Management

\- Production issues

\- Competitors

\- The x86 architecture is getting old

# Management

I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts.

It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer.

# Production issues

Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they  absolutely needed to stay competitive.

# Competitors

If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come.

Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that.

# The x86 architecture is getting old

We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD.

The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM.

I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production.

ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores.

# Pros

Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them:

\- Management

\- Brand

\- Production issues

\- Competitors

\- Architecture & support

Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment

# Management

Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks.

Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia):

And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him.

It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day.

# Brand

While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone.

# Production issues

Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand.

This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits.

I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though.

# Competitors

This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway.

AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill.

With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support.

# Architecture & Support

Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s

So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now.

BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this.

There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source.

Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

My question to all of you is this. Do I wait the whole day out and risk it, or simply sell the calls and keep the little money I have left to begin back from square one.

As a result of uncertain financial conditions during 2020 and the Gamestop event in 2021 there has been an explosion of people interested in investing in stocks. One metric to measure this is by looking at subscribers to the investing subs on Reddit. 

WSB (\~800K Jan 2020 to \~8.8M Feb 2021): [https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets](https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets), Stocks:  (\~473K Jan 2020 to \~2.17M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/stocks](https://subredditstats.com/r/stocks), Investing (\~880K Jan 2020 to \~1.6M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/investing](https://subredditstats.com/r/investing), Penny Stocks (\~130K Jan 2020 to \~1.1M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/pennystocks](https://subredditstats.com/r/pennystocks) Day Trading (\~45K Jan 2020 to \~370K Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/daytrading](https://subredditstats.com/r/daytrading) ...

The list goes on and on. You get the picture.

In addition, with a lot of people still working from home, stimulus checks, entertainment venues (and restaurants and bars) being closed and the K-shaped recovery we have a lot of wealthier people stuck at home during the day who have extra cash. In essence, there are a lot of new investors with time, money and access to a personal computer. There have been a lot of articles about the K-shaped recovery: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/10/24/three-charts-show-a-k-shaped-recovery/?sh=3ebea945305f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/10/24/three-charts-show-a-k-shaped-recovery/?sh=3ebea945305f), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/how-a-k-shaped-recovery-is-widening-u-s-inequality-quicktake](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/how-a-k-shaped-recovery-is-widening-u-s-inequality-quicktake) etc.

My theory, and here is where it is just a theory, is that there are a lot of new investors who do not have the trading experience or fundamental analysis skills to judge valuation of a company and its stock price, essentially whether a company is fundamentally strong or not\*. Thus, you are seeing these massive runups for stocks beyond GME where fundamental analysis has been thrown out the window. Balance sheets, whether company actually sells something, cash flow, strength of the management, do not really matter because if you heard about it on twitter it could be a good buy. Essentially any stock that gets hyped is becoming a meme stock.

**I’m calling this EcoNOMNOMics theory**\*\*. Basically, when you have a lot of inexperienced investors they are essentially like children who will NOM on anything sweet given to them regardless of the fundamental value of the thing they are eating (nutrients, macros, is this actually good for me? Etc.). They experience the sugar high of seeing the stock shoot through the moon until it crashes like blood sugar but then they still want more so its on to the next stock.

Right now, it’s all about figuring out what the next cookie is. 

\*You might argue that the true valuation of a company is going to be different depending on how you measure it...is it assets and liabilities balance, revenue, strength of the product etc. Some people believe the value of a stock is determined solely by supply and demand (i.e. its worth that much if people are willing to pay that much). I realize this is tricky territory.

\*\*These are just my thoughts. I don’t claim to think this is 100% right. I’ve just been thinking about it a lot. Thanks for reading!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any businesses that are struggling with a key component. Hi, so to give an example of what im looking for, I was doing some research on weed stocks and I noticed that there was a correlation with an article talking about how Canadian weed shortages had been solved in November and there is a correlating rise in general weed stock value.  This led me to wonder, is there a way I go about finding companies that have maybe 1 or 2 flaws that are holding their business model back, but when solved could act as a catalyst to shoot their value up.  

As a new investor I think this would be a fun little experiment of sorts. To try and find a company or two that fall into that category and see if at any point a solution comes available to try to use that as an entrance strategy.

I'll be doing some more looking around the webs today to see if I can find anything myself, just wanted to get perhaps some more experienced investors opinions on the matter.

Cheers <3_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are all the weed stocks tanking? Why are all of the weed stocks tanking?

I bought into APHA in Hopes to make out when the TLRY merger goes through with a good amount of research put into my reasoning. As of yesterday, the stock plummeted but so did TLRY, the meme weed stock, Aurora, canopy growth, and even MSOS etf and I’m sure many more. 

I know this may have been due to them all being in the same sector but they all have almost identical patterns and several people have mentioned their trading was suspended for APHA, and the meme weed stock, these that I know of. 

Does anyone know what’s going on here? Is it truly just sector related to tank that bad?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (2/12) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News #Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-12-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to log another positive week

> * U.S. stock futures fell Friday, one day after a mixed session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average dip slightly from its previous record high close, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out new record high closes. All three stock benchmarks were tracking for their second straight positive week, in a continuation of February’s strength. So far this month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased 4.8%, 5.4% and 7.3%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 broke two-month winning streaks in January, while the Nasdaq rose for a fourth month in a row in January.

*****

> # 2. Booming Disney+ helps to offset theme park slump

> * Shares of Disney rose about 2% in premarket trading after the company reported an adjusted fiscal first-quarter profit of 32 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 41 cents per share. Revenue fell 22% to $16.25 billion from a year earlier, though it did beat estimates. Due to Covid, Disney saw a slump in theme park attendance and box office results, but the success of its streaming video service continued. Disney+ added more than 21 million subscribers during the quarter for a total of 94.9 million.

*****

> # 3. White House to address travel, education concerns

> * Major airline CEOs are scheduled to meet virtually Friday with the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, according to Reuters. The meeting comes as airlines, unions and industry groups strongly object to the possibility of requiring predeparture Covid testing for domestic flights.
The CDC plans to issue new guidelines Friday on how to reopen U.S. schools as safely as possible. Pressure to reopen or expand in-person learning has been building for months as students and parents tire of remote classes. Reopening schools is a top priority for the Biden administration.

*****

> # 4. U.S. secures 200 million more Covid vaccine doses

> * The White House secured deals for 100 million additional doses of Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and 100 million more of Moderna’s. During Thursday’s tour of the National Institutes of Health, President Joe Biden said the U.S. will have now enough supply of the two-shot vaccines to inoculate 300 million Americans by the end of July. Biden is trying to pick up the pace of vaccinations after a slower-than-expected rollout under former President Donald Trump. Roughly 34.7 million out of some 331 million Americans have received at least their first dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, February 12th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Magnachip MX Expected to Beat Q4 Guidance: Undervalued at 7x EV/EVITDA & Supplies to 5G OLED Phones / Margin Upside After a 40% rally - Magnachip is now 7x EV/ EBITDA and still extremely cheap for this fast growing semiconductor company focused on 5G and OLED smartphones.

Magnachip Semiconductor NYSE:MX - 33% global market share in OLED display drivers or DDICs (allows OLED screens to function), behind Samsung which is #1 (66% mkt share)

* Cash on balance sheet $540MM as of Sep 2020
* Mkt cap of $650MM and debt of $308MM
* EV of $450MM

**Valuation: LCD DDIC display suppliers HIMX trades at a 3.3x EV/Revenue multiple and SYNA (Synaptics, market leader in the other type of display chip called a TDDI and used by AAPL for all iPhone screens) at a 3.65x and 23 x EV/EBITDA. Both are seeing their LCD revenue move into OLEDZ Using a revenue multiple of 2x makes for a $1 billion EV (RR Q3 revenue that doesn't include sold subsidiary) for MX compared to its EV of $450MM -> >100% return.** 

**Using a conservative 15x EBITDA multiple off of RR Q3 EBITDA of $48MM (removing gain from sale of subsidiary) = EV of $720MM -> 60% return**

Note: Earnings Wed 2/17

**OLED is Booming**

MX is the largest independent supplier of OLED DDICs which power the display screens, and focused on high frame rate phones. It’s tied to the hip of Samsung and LG and a big winner in the OLED space especially with 5G and will most likely beat their Q4 guidance. OLED and chip manufacturers are fully sold out as per guidance from several semiconductor companies.

For each phone with OLED, there is 1 DDIC. For a rollable or foldable OLED screen, there are more than 1 DDIC chip on average. MX is also getting into laptop, TV, and auto OLED screens which all use more than 1 chip (given larger size).

**Q4 2020 Guidance Beat**

Magnachip Semiconductor Q4 '20 revenue/profits are likely to surprise, here’s why: in their most recent analyst presentation, they said their Q4 guidance put out in Q3 was based on LOWER manufacturing capacity from their foundry partners. That allocation went up.

From the analyst call: "Our Q4 revenue guidance range was based on allocation from foundry partners for OLED as well as internal Fab 3 ramp-up. We were able to secure greater supply than we originally expected."

The supply crunch is affecting 8" fabs and MX focuses on using 12" foundries which are less tight, and that explains why MX was able to receive more allocation.

In addition, there is likely strong forward guidance given improved margins below...

**Supply Crunch and Potential Acquirer?**

Synaptics, a $3.7bln market cap company that dominates the adjacent semiconductor touch chips for OLED screens (called TDDI, used in all AAPL phones) in their earnings call on Feb 4 said there is a supply crunch in OLED DDICs and a potential for "a tactical opportunity":

"Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed..\[On\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity."

Synaptics acquired an OLED DDIC company in the past (8-9 years ago) and did not make much out of it, focusing on the touch aspect versus the IC chip. However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for MX.

HIMX, another company operating in the display panel space (albeit not in OLED), has said that the transition from LCD to OLED screens is happening fast and sees OLED DDIC s as a major opportunity: "As we have repeatedly indicated, traditional smartphone DDICs are quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED....We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small- and medium-panel driver IC business in 2021."

In fact, HIMX said that given the "helplessly tight" semiconductor situation. **"We can very often transfer the cost increase to customers and a bit more."**

**Conclusion**

For a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -> drastically undervalued at \~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...

She was a kid back then so she didn't do anything with them and over time actually forgot they existed, well that and the mail from Disney stopped coming. Now with all the stock hype we remembered to dig them out but we have no idea what they are worth now.

She remembers Disney split the stocks at one point so there might be more.



How and where can we get more info on this? She only has the two stock certificates, instructions for form W-8BEN (2001) from the IRS - certificate of foreign status of beneficial owner for united states tax withholding and some kind of annual meeting invitation and a check for one dividend. Oh also we are in Europeso I guess that complicates things :I_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AT&T: A sleeping giant that's about to wake Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. It’s HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous).

That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, "invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda..."

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

7. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hyliion Introduces Next Generation Battery Module to Improve Performance and Efficiency.

For some context, after performing some entrepreneurial endeavors, I put in roughly 600 dollars into an investing account. I made the decision of buying into AMC at around $2.50 then sold when it peaked at about $20, transferred in some more money, bringing my portfolio up to about $1,250. I invested the money into cheap stocks in emerging industries like weed, along with Tesla, Phizer and Moderna, plus certain companies which were hurt from the government enforced lockdown which should rise back up in value in the following months like Carnival. 

After some advice from a trusted friend of mine along with my father, I came to the conclusion that I should have set limit orders to sell when the stocks reach a certain value in order to protect my money. So, if anyone here has any advice for that, I'd love to hear it.

On a side note, I am somewhat considering abandoning stocks like Tesla and Apple, and going all in on these smaller stocks, but I have no idea if that would work, so I'd like your advice on that too...

In my opinion, I'm currently way too heavily in with FVRR, and despite good history, I'm unsure that the price is maintainable. 

I believe ETSY, MSFT, NVIDIA are good growth stocks that I can hold onto long term. 

I'm hoping that COCA will recover from the pandemic, and I was interested in having a dividend stock too just out of curiosity.

## Key takeaways

* Natural human instincts often undermine our success as investors.
* Common pitfalls include aversion to loss and ambiguity, following the crowd, and focusing on information that's recent or confirms what we already believe.
* Antidotes include seeking out alternative information, doing your research, and developing a long-term financial plan that you can stick with.  


1. Avoid losses at all costs: Loss aversion
2. "I am the greatest!" Confirmation bias
3. Getting stuck on the first thing you see: Anchoring bias
4. The breaking news problem: Recency bias
5. There's safety in numbers ... right? Herding bias

However, there may be some problems associated with this. Since we know she is famous for her prediction, let's look at the charts.  Tesla is well known to be overvalued having its stock represent 40% of the auto industry and Tesla has yet not made a single cent. In no way are 40% of driven cars Teslas by any means.  Cathie also expresses interest in the success of Bitcoin.  We can take two things in common with this.  Both $TSLA and Bitcoin have a lot less intrinsic value than what they're worth.  In fact, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all and is solely dependent only on the amount of buyers and holders. 

 So why invest in things that are way overvalued? Because of psychology. It has appeared that many people tend to invest in the long time future without pondering much about the risks and later create a bubble.  For example, many believe in the ultimate success of Tesla becoming way bigger in the future.  Now, while that is true, it doesn't mean it will be as dominant as what the stock is saying right now.  Companies like Porsche, Jaguar already have full electric cars.  Other car brands are slowly transitioning to hybrid and then full EV's not to mention EV production companies such as Polestar.  Thinking that Tesla will be the dominant company in the world is just unrealistic as it leaves out possible competitors and obstacles.  In her ETFs, she describes them as "innovation investing" as she is choosing the companies that are working in the fields that have a high success rate in the future(Autonomous Robots, Gene technology, etc).  Like I mentioned earlier, it is foolish to think that these companies will be the dominant companies in the future without competition or obstacles, leaving the ETF's extremely vulnerable to being overvalued like Tesla.  It is also foolish to assume already large corporations such as Google and Amazon won't try to get into these markets.  

What Cathie is doing is tapping into the minds of younger long-term investors by claiming that the stocks she invest in will have a Tesla/Bitcoin affect.  Will her ETF's continue going up?  Yes, definitely.  However, is it very likely that there will be a massive bubble on these ETF's and markets?  Also yes.  Cathie seems to be investing in younger investors brains than the companies that she is investing in currently.  She is changing the game by giving what the investors want but leaves out critical components._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Made a post about KT Corp on another reddit and it was taken down.

Like the title says I'm a long term investor in KT and have been for a while.  I know the company's history and financial history.  I see a few people commenting in posts about it wanting to know why the stock price has been so depressed for a while.  

The company spent much of their profits on expanding and marketing the 5G network for much of 2019 and by the time 2020 came around covid hit.  

They have changed CEO's and are really aiming at concentrating growth in the AI, data and cloud sector and according to their last ER they showed for 11.8% growth there already, even though their focus in that area is still relatively new.  They want to shift away from being just a telecom.  The company is extremely diversified with holdings in real estate and finance for example.  They are unloading some of their holdings that are bringing down the balance sheet.  I believe KT Powertel was a recent sell.

The company is in an ongoing contract to buy back 300,000,000,000 won of its stock and to date they have fulfilled 69.1% of that obligation.  KT has even stated the possibility of disposing of some of those shares to reduce the number of outstanding shares.  

They are fully committed to dividend payments and the last time they did not pay a dividend was 2014.  At last years investor meeting there was talk about going to a bi annual dividend.  

The fact is the company is worth far more than it is trading at based on assets alone.  Their long term debt is conservative compared to most other corporations.  There aren't many companies I would want to be invested in if an economic collapse happens but this is one of them.  The stock price might fluctuate but the odds of KT failing as a company are ZERO.  They will be the ones in a position to exploit growth if that does happen.  I'm not as eloquent as many on here but I hope this sheds some light on KT._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Momentus & Discussion on Space Industrialization ****Please note this is not financial advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts.***

 &nbsp;

**Space Industrialization**

 &nbsp;

I want to start by noting that I think the industrialization and commercialization of space is a sector that is going to see tremendous growth in our lifetime. The current size of the global space economy is expected to grow from an estimated $415 billion to $1.4 trillion by 2030, driving demand for transportation and infrastructure services in space. It is clear to me why Cathie Wood is introducing an ARK Space Exploration ETF, since this will be another booming industry. I'll share a quote from Elon Musk:

 &nbsp;

*"You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars."*

 &nbsp;

The colonization of Mars is going to be one of mankind's greatest challenges and an objective that I strongly believe is achievable in a few decades. But it's not just Mars, it's the entirety of space that has virtually endless opportunities for growth. NASA, SpaceX, Starlink, Virgin Galactic, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Astra, and many more companies are at the forefront of making this possible. But there is one that really intrigues me: Momentus. 

 &nbsp;

**What is Momentus?**

 &nbsp;

*"As we continue to develop new technologies and improve the capabilities of our rides, we will continually introduce more services, each contributing to the further industrialization of space. To realize a future where humanity is equipped with all it needs to flourish throughout the solar system, we need to be able to mine, manufacture, build, and generate power in space. Momentus will make this possible."* - Momentus 

 &nbsp;

[Momentus](https://momentus.space/), founded in 2017, provides infrastructure services necessary to facilitate the inevitable need for space industrialization.  Their core service is in-space transportation. What are some of their services?

 &nbsp;


* Space transportation services - first hub and spoke model of space, providing last mile delivery in partnership with key launchers, such as SpaceX

* Satellite as a service - hosted payload services that significantly decrease the cost of developing, launching and maintaining satellites

* In-orbit services - maintaining, repairing and refueling satellites in orbit

 &nbsp;

There is a lot more really cool stuff they are envisioning to do, like equipping vehicles with robotic arms capable of performing proximity maneuvers, docking, and refueling. They also expect that extending the lives of larger spacecrafts, relocating or deorbiting satellites, conducting salvage missions, robotic repairs, etc. will be done in a day's work for their service fleet. Momentus stands apart from other companies because their whole business strategy revolves around space infrastructure services, which is only going to become more and more necessary as the space economy becomes further and further developed. They have a key partnership with a few companies, most notably SpaceX, and many customers such as NASA and Lockheed Martin. 

 &nbsp;

I urge you to take a look at their [investor presentation](https://momentus.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Momentus_Investor_Presentation_2020_10_12.pdf), as there is some seriously cool things they are working on that will make Momentus one of the leading space industrialization companies in the world. The last page includes their financial forecasts, which I am not taking too seriously right now given this is an up and coming sector with massive potential.

It doesn't matter how many trades you make in a year, it will get taxed for the same amount right? Say, if I sold 10 positions this year and made a profit of 5k vs selling 5 positions in a year for the same profit of 5k. 

And last year I had lost around 7k, but since losing that 7k, I'm now up around 11k. So that rule about your losses covering up to 3k for a year would lower the taxable amount for my profits next year down to 8k and the other 4k from the loss would be able to lower my taxable amount for the year after?

Earnings is around the corner on Feb 17th.  I believe the stock will double soon as they are a growing company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My approach to weed stocks I know the volume of weed stocks has been up significantly recently and is super tempting to get in but also confusing when and where to get in, but I believe in the weed industry over time as much as I believe in anything and MY ADVICE is if you don’t want to risk your money with volatility caused by people just buying it to pump or whatever, you should look into weed ETFs like $THCX for example, the one I am holding. The ETF has holdings in aton of the major weed stocks from tilray to aurora and over time as the weed market goes up, it will inevitably go up. I’m not against buying single company stocks for weed but in my eyes the industry is unpredictable and an ETF is smart to look into. Sorry for that being so long

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see "Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..." by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions. I am not a financial advisor nor a professional. I own 14k shares in Blackberry, as well as options (10x 8/17/21 20c BB). Do your own DD and fact check me as well*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Starting Over I just started investing in the US market and made some silly moves right off the bat. And I need some advice how I can start over and build my US portfolio after all my dumb FOMO mistakes. 

List of FOMO silly mistakes already made: 

1. A certain meme stock - got greedy and didn’t take profit and so I lost about 63% of the Meme investment or 15% of my total initial capital. 

2. Meme 5G stock - bought into the hype and still holding 1000 @ 4.85. I believe the case for 5G is there but might take another 5 years. Not sure if I should divest and eat the loss in order to reallocate the remainder of this capital to other LTBH stocks. 

3. A certain cannabis stock - told myself that I would learn from the Meme stock saga in (1) but evidently didn’t and got caught out. My only consolation was that it was a super small position and I lost about 28% of the Cannabis investment or 0.5% of my total initial capital. 

In total, these 3 stocks, on a cost basis, consisted 75% of my initial capital. The other 25% is split into other stocks that I believe will have a long term potential (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, MGNI etc)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain aftermarket and premarket trading to me? So i was holding some ACB Stocks for quite a while.  Bought at the worst time, as many have in weed stocks.  One of my 1st investment lessons was learn about the companies you want to invest in after that mess...   But the last few days fortunately for me the stock prices of all weed stocks skyrocketed (as all of reddit knows)...  And i couldnt help but keep tracking the stock through after hours and premarket and consistently updating my stop loss limit orders, as im finally in the green...  the price would go up substantially through the day, taper off the. Go back up in after hours slightly, and then skyroclet in premarket...  3 days in a row...  til it tank today.  I just want to understand whats going on w prices when the markets closed to a regular joe like me..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding The Stock Market (Todays MJ APHA/TLRY etc. example) There is a simple fallacy overlooked about the saying "buy low, sell high." It is the desired outcome, but it childishly misses the actual method/goal, which is to "gain a +% change, and avoid a -% change."

This subtle nuance has extremely important differences in how you make your trading decisions, because people who are only thinking in terms of "buy low, sell high" are likely to fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy where if they have bought in at a price and then realize that the price is trending down and likely will continue to trend down, they foolishly accept this -% change because they expect in some longer term the trend will reverse so that they can sell higher than they bought in.

However the smarter trader will recognize a downturn as an opportunity to sell before eating all that likely -% change. And will then buy back in when he believes the price will start increasing, thereby gaining all the recouped -% change that he avoided and stacking his future +% change on top of his previous sell price from before when he expected the price to go down.

In summary the question you need to ask yourself is "Which is more likely, a price increase or a price decrease?" And to trade accordingly to make the best and safest bets.

For example I've been seeing many people here foolishly complaining about having bought into stocks that "became meme stocks" because "how dare people pump up the price of my long term investments so that I can get gains now that would have taken much longer, I'm not happy about this unsustainably high price that I got in on the ground floor of so I'm going to hold until the price goes back down and then I'm going to hold until my longterm profits eventually get the price up this far in a sustainable way." Really great way to miss out on a lot of money. If you asked almost anybody yesterday about MJ stocks, they would tell you that the price was pumped and that it would crash soon, so the obvious conclusion to the smart person was to get out before losing from all that far more likely -% change rather than risk an unlikely further +% change. Going forward MJ is still expected to be a likely and high longterm +% change, so most people should be cautiously looking to see if the current floor holds or if it continues to bleed a further -% change before buying in on the anticipation of more +% change.

Another fallacy: "Timing the market vs. Time in the market"

This is a false dichotomy, which favors the previously mentioned longterm "sell high" fallacy in ignorance of the actual "gain +% change and avoid -% changes" The correct method is always to do both as best you can. If you invest during a high stock market, wait 10 years and then check your investments, it won't matter how long you've been in the market if you miss-timed a longterm play and are currently in a market crash which are typical due to typical large ebb/flow economic trends.

"gain +% change and avoid -% changes" do this for as much as you are able, if you day trade, sell when you expect it will go down and buy when you expect it will go up. If you swing trade look at the broader trends of news and the price history and buy when you expect it to go up, sell when you expect it to go down. If you're a longterm investor look at the company's fundamentals and buy those that are undervalued and will go up.

Some of The best plays are those that combine expected long term +% change and expected short term +% change for reduced likelihood of unexpected dips and more +% change opportunities.

Ultimately the future prices are probabilistic and may often not match your expectations and you will often miss out on trade opportunities, you just need to keep trying to make the plays that will net you the best +% changes, and if you make good decisions you should average positive % gains.

&#x200B;

Other things: absolute price#/stock#/etc. are mostly arbitrary, except for their implications with meaningful metrics like market cap. It is mostly irrelevant to you how many shares you bought, what price it is, etc. all that matters is what proportion of your funds have you invested, what % change do you expect the stock to undergo in the future, and how quickly do you expect it to happen.

Utilizing outside normal hours volatility gains/spikes is often a great time to sell (which is why retail investors are sidelined from trading then by most brokers, can't have a level playing field or the house wouldn't always win), afternoon lows are frequently great buying points and decently reliable._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My 3 best picks of the decade.

I've accumulated over 30 stocks again. In the last few months I have started to lean towards very high growth small caps because the returns are phenomenal, especially in the healthcare sector. So without further ado:

EXAS: 23b cap. One of ARKG biggest holdings.

VCEL: 1.8b cap. Wallstreetzen has expected earnings to grow 6275% over the next 3 years.

RGEN: 12.2b cap. Has returned 927% in 5 years with no sign of slowing CAGR.

DMTK: 1.7b cap. No way I sell this one. Just entered a deal with blue cross blue shield and I've made 100% this month alone. Growth has just started. Jonah Lupton is very high on this stock. If you don't know who that is, look him up on Twitter. He has half a million followers who all buy his picks. Huge returns whenever he posts about a company.

ZYXI- 670m cap. Already profitable with exceptional CAGR. Short interest is really high which makes me wonder if I'm missing something.

PGNY- 4.3b cap. 118% annual revenue growth rate. Hedge fund interest has risen every quarter since their inception. Yahoo expects 185% growth.

SPRO- 552m cap. Biotech company with several drugs in the pipeline. This is one that can 100% in a month, and perform well in the meantime.

OPRX- 818m cap. Expected to become profitable by a wide margin this year. This is one of my largest holdings as I expect market cap to quadruple (even though its already returned 1711% over 5 years. The joy of small caps).

TMDX- 813m cap. Pretty sure this is who Jonah Lupton was talking about when he said he was going to announce a new buy Friday. People in the medical industry who see this product in person are usually in awe at how it keeps organs alive outside of the body.

SWAV: 4.4b cap. Growing revenue at a ridiculous rate._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the math behind the rise and fall of stock prices? So I'm interested in knowing how stock prices change.

And I am reasonably well connected to the industry (Sold for SSYS, had a printer for a long time, most of my social media is plastered with it).  SSYS and DDD did 10x faster than weed stocks.  Nobody's peeped about them either in the meme subs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to fix my investments before I hurt them any further? Hi all,

Before getting into it: I'm 32 years old living in Los Angeles. Currently employed at a tech company. Current income in $195k. Currently married with our first kid on the way.

So I came to the very hard realization today that I was addicted to gambling, especially in options trading. I got super lucky one time with Game Stop and made around $200k profit split between my Roth IRA and my broker account. My Roth IRA I have reconfigured to put all that money into VTSAX and some into ARKK as a set it and forget it.

My problem is that this past week, I stupidly got caught in the wind of fomo and just yesterday bought leaps on weed stocks, particularly APHA and TLRY. My APHA leap expires in Jan 2022 and TLRY in Jan 2023. Today was an absolute blood bath, and I watched my portfolio slowly bleed.

In my broker account, it grew from $35k to $170k after I sold Game Stop, but it still hurts to have made such a stupid, greedy decision with the weed stocks. I know for sure I don't want to screw up my incredibly lucky gains, so to stop the further bleeding I am tempted to close all my positions right now at a loss. As of right now, my portfolio is around $139k, so technically still house money, but I don't want to ruin it all completely. This is supposed to be money to help buy a home in the next 2 to 3 years.

My questions:

Should I cut my losses RIGHT now, and just put all that money into VTI or some other safer and reliable ETF?

Or is it better for me to wait it out just a little bit since I have time on the leaps and hopefully I can sell at a smaller loss, at which point I would still just put it all into an ETF?

I know I've made incredibly stupid decisions and I'm trying to set myself up properly right now so I don't continue down this path. Seeing my portfolio lose so much money so quickly was a huge eye opener for me, and I don't want to go through that moving forward. Feel free to call me a dumb ass or an idiot, but I know I'll be staying far away from options trading now. I just need to know the best route to manage this.

Thank you all for looking and for your ideas. I honestly really appreciate it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help understanding a Wash Sale. I need help understanding a Wash Sale.

I really don't understand why the MJ sector is just now getting blown up. I've been in since Biden won the Presidency, and tbh im surprised it took this long to blow up.

My best investments so far (6 months experience haha) have been the MJ sector, however this new meme label is very annoying.

If you're trying to get on the AMC or GME trend of Hype and Shorts and xyz, you do you, but just know that this isn't one of those situations. Weed is the future.. I feel so lame for saying that haha but it really is. Think of how many people capitalized on profits right after the prohibition was lifted for alcohol. I think MJ will be even bigger. Not even close. But thats just me.
