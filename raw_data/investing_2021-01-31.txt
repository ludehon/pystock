 WSJ Exclusive: Exxon, Chevron CEOs Discussed Merger This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:

* * *

The chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.

Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.

Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.

A combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.

But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.

One of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.

A handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron’s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips ’ roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.

Such a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.

It also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.

Many investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.

In an interview discussing Chevron’s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company’s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.

“As for larger scale things, it’s happened before,” Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. “Time will tell.”

Paul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.

Exxon was America’s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron’s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.

Exxon’s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron’s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.

Exxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.

Chevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet—in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.

Exxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Some investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon’s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.

Mr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon’s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.

Meanwhile, the company’s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon’s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.

Exxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.

Rivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven’t rewarded.

Exxon and Chevron haven’t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.

I came across two posts over on WSB and before you click out of this post just please hear me out. Ive been on the sub for a while now, i’m talking 3 years and I have found that while there are a bunch of yoloing and smooth brained people on that sub, there are also a lot of bright people there too (not to say the people yoloing and such aren’t bright but). What I mean is there are people who carefully form some sort of thesis or in depth review on potential plays that have absolutely helped me grow my portfolio. Anyways so I came across two posts about $VALE and found the research to be incredibly informative and was curious what more people think about this company. Some things to highlight from these posts are how $VALE is the number 1 producer in nickel and they have many production facilities in high volume nickel areas from around the world. I also found it interesting how EVs use a TON of nickel. Shouldn’t this be a no brainer play with the shift of EV from around the world? Nickel is used for the battery found within these EVs. I also think it’s quite interesting how Nickel has been on a bull run ever since the start of the pandemic back in early 2020.

I also play this game with my kids and the money this company is raking is unreal? They may go public this month Feb RBLX and I will invest a few bucks only to get my money back for all the money my kids have spent on this platform. This is an interesting read:**

 Roblox isn’t yet profitable, in part because it recognizes revenue from in-game purchases little by little over the gaming lives of its users. Revenue rose 68%, to $589 million, in the first nine months of last year. Bookings, a simpler measure of money coming in, jumped 171%, to $1.24 billion. 

 

MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler estimates that Roblox has recently been averaging $100 million in free cash flow a quarter. Assume that figure could quickly double and you can make a case for Roblox’s valuation resembling that of Take-Two, the priciest of the legacy videogame makers, at 39 times projected free cash flow. [Activision Blizzard](https://www.barrons.com/quote/ATVI) (ATVI) trades at 29 times and [Electronic Arts](https://www.barrons.com/quote/EA) (EA), 23 times. All three stocks soared last year, as time playing videogames exploded.

And it’s not just kids. Adults 45 to 54 increased their game time by 59% last year, according to the NPD Group, a market researcher. Spending rose faster. Last year, the global videogame business took in an estimated $180 billion. That’s about $80 billion more than the movie business at its peak._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kinepolis DD (EBR:KIN) I decided to write a small DD-piece on Kinepolis (**EBR:KIN**) since I’ve seen commenters on this subreddit, and other stock market-related subs, wanting to diversify their portfolio with European stocks, but being unsure what exactly to invest in. Coupled with the current hype around AMC, I thought this would be a fun little DD to write up as well.

Before the pandemic, KIN was worth around €60 ($72.8). It fell to €30 ($36.4) when COVID-19 reached Europe and, later, North-America. It took another hit in October when it became clear current COVID-19 measures would last into 2021. For the last couple of months, KIN has been hovering around €35 ($42.5). I believe Kinepolis has significantly more potential than its North-American competitors and will quickly reach €60 again once the economy opens up again. Before the pandemic, its worth was almost double that of Cinemark Holdings, INC (CNK) and triple that of AMC and IMAX.

The Kinepolis Group operates 111 cinemas: 10 in the US, 45 in Canada, and 56 in Europe - this amounts to a total of 1,081 screens. Its core businesses consists of box office-movies, cultural events (think theater, art movies, film festivals, etc.), B2B (Kinepolis provides for conferences, premieres, and other corporate events), film distribution, and advertising. So far, pretty ordinary stuff for a cinema chain. 

Kinepolis distinguishes itself from its competitors through its real estate business (similar to McDonald’s strategy). They own the majority of their real estate and they rent out venues to shops, restaurants, and cafes in their cineplexes. Basically, what this means is that Kinepolis is not burdened with enormous rents while having little revenue during the pandemic. It recently also got approved for an €80 million loan. All-in-all, the company is in good shape despite the pandemic. Considering the company’s financial stability (and future prospects), I could possibly see Kinepolis win ground in the US with the other cinema groups struggling financially. It already acquired the American group MJR Digital Cinemas in 2019 and bought Canada’s Landmark Cinemas in 2017, for example.

The group is also quick to pick up on innovations within the industry like adopting new sound systems and laser technologies. In 2018, Kinepolis adopted Cinionic’s world’s first 4K smart laser. This was about 1-2 years earlier than its competitors. Fun fact: it built the world’s first megaplex in Brussels.

Like others have pointed out before me, I genuinely believe people are yearning to go back to the movies. Cinema-going is very much ingrained in Western culture and will, moreover, be one of the more affordable outing-options as well (a huge plus considering the economic situation). Once the vaccination process picks up and restrictions loosen people will be going to the movies again. Personally speaking, I’m an avid movie-goer and Kinepolis’ cinemas are some of the best out there (with a wide range of snacks and drinks, not always common in European cinemas).

The bearish take on this is of course people staying hesitant to go to the movies again (although Kinepolis takes its COVID-19 precautions seriously, at least in Belgium) and that the movie industry doesn’t pick as quickly. Although they did some re-runs of old movies when they were briefly allowed to open again during the summer, it didn’t pull as many people as they had hoped. New movies like Tenet were successful, however.

On 25 February, Kinepolis will publish its annual results of 2020 which will be interesting to follow.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. As has been mentioned ad nauseam: do your own DD. But I do believe in the possibilities of this company because of my research coupled with my personal feelings about this industry and Kinepolis.

**Edit:** wording, syntax and spelling._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Facebook's moat widening or shrinking? My unorganized thoughts, do you see any flaws? **Hardware:**

I think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached "Facebook is evil" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.

Facebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.

High investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)

VR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.

**Traditionally Listed Moats**

Intangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.

Growth of users means **network effects still growing**

Number and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**

**Competition?**

There is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**

**Messaging**

There can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone

**Misc**

I think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.

The integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.

Facebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)

The only other pure "Real Identity social network" is Linkedin is a professional network.

**Problems**

**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**

**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like "Facebook sells data". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**

**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.

**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**

**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**

**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things

Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).

Hope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
