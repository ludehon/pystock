Now Mr. Benioff is taking steps that analysts say aim higher, intensifying the company's battle with the industry's biggest player:  Microsoft Corp. 

Salesforce is in advanced talks to acquire  Slack Technologies Inc. ,  The Wall Street Journal  reported Wednesday, in what would be Mr. Benioff's biggest acquisition to date and the company's most direct attack on a market  Microsoft  has identified as critical to its growth.

The deal, which could still fall through, would add fuel to Salesforce's ambition to become the go-to software platform for business customers to use for everything from data analysis to managing customer relationships to even daily communication.

The pandemic has amplified Salesforce's efforts. When Covid-19 broke out, Mr. Benioff quickly launched [w](https://Work.com)ork.com -- a suite of applications companies could use for contract tracing, mental-health checks and shift scheduling.

A deal for Slack could heat up the simmering rivalry between Salesforce and  Microsoft . About five years ago  Microsoft  was in talks to buy Salesforce, but the deal fell apart over price. Salesforce lost out to  Microsoft  in 2016 in bidding for  LinkedIn Corp. , the business-focused social-media network. The loss stung. Salesforce responded by urging regulators to examine  Microsoft's  proposed purchase on antitrust grounds; the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

Landing Slack, which  Microsoft  once tried to acquire, could amount to a bit of revenge for Mr. Benioff.

Having failed to capture Slack,  Microsoft  launched its own workplace collaboration tool, called Teams, spurring a sometimes heated battle between the two companies.

"They want to kill us," Slack CEO  Stewart Butterfield  told the Journal earlier this year. This summer, Slack filed a complaint with the  European Union  over alleged antitrust behavior by  Microsoft  in using its dominance to push Teams.

Slack "extends the footprint of what Salesforce goes after," said Jefferies analyst  Brent Thill . "Not everyone uses a sales system, but everyone can use collaboration. The beauty of Slack and Teams is that it touches everything inside enterprises."

Mr. Benioff has a history of deal making since he co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago and turned it into one of the most successful companies in the then still nascent market of providing software as a service. Salesforce completed its biggest-ever purchase last year, paying around  $15 billion  in stock for data-analytics platform  Tableau Software Inc. 

A year earlier it splashed out more than  $5 billion  for cloud-application provider MuleSoft. Inc. This year Salesforce said it was buying cloud-software provider  Vlocity Inc. 

Mr. Benioff has long been one of  Silicon Valley's  highest-profile and most outspoken executives, using venues like the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos, Switzerland , to champion causes. He set up Salesforce with a pledge of corporate giving and bought himself an even larger platform with his acquisition of  Time Magazine  two years ago.

The  San Francisco -based company also has made a big push into the emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing tools to help customers make better use of their data. In 2016, it acquired PredictionIO, which makes software for building machine-learning apps. That followed the purchase of MinHash and Tempo AI, two further machine-learning companies. In 2014, it bought RelateIQ, which also specializes in the field.

Breaking into the market of workplace collaboration has long been on Salesforce's agenda. In 2010, it launched Chatter, a private social network for companies to collaborate. And in 2016, it bought cloud-document collaboration app company  Quip Inc.  for more than  $500 million . Neither product attracted a wide following. Acquiring Slack, which Salesforce had previously explored buying, would immediately make the company a big player in the workplace- collaboration market. Slack has more than 130,000 paying customers.

Salesforce, which declined to comment for this article, is pursuing Slack as competition in its core business of customer relationship management software is intensifying.  Adobe Inc.  this month said it would buy Workfront, a platform for marketers, for  $1.5 billion .  Microsoft  also has been pushing its rival product, called Dynamics. Salesforce still has the largest share with 20.1% of the world-wide market in 2019 compared with 2.6% for Microsoft Dynamics, according to research firm  Gartner Inc. 

Even with Slack, Salesforce would be a comparatively small rival to  Microsoft . The  Redmond, Wash. , company had sales of  $143 billion  in its latest financial year, generated by business enterprise software, its cloud-computing infrastructure, and consumer-facing businesses, such as videogaming, which has exploded during the pandemic. Its sales are roughly nine times Salesforce's annual revenue.  Microsoft's  market valuation tops  $1.6 trillion , about six times that of Slack and Salesforce combined.

Last year Salesforce said it was seeking to reach  $28 billion  in annual sales in the 2023 financial year. It had  $16 billion  in sales in its most recent financial year.

"He really needs to keep growing," said  Mark Moerdler , senior research analyst at  Bernstein Research , of Mr. Benioff. "He needs another big acquisition. Slack gives him a big acquisition. It gives him revenue."

Slack also has been looking to broaden its appeal. Companies have used Slack principally for intra-office communications. In June, the software provider introduced Slack Connect, which allows messages to be sent between different companies. Slack's Mr. Butterfield said the feature has driven a rise in paying customers and should fuel future growth.

But big acquisition plans aren't without pitfalls. When Salesforce tried to buy social-media company  Twitter Inc.  in 2016, Mr. Benioff faced significant pushback from investors and he walked away from the deal. Although Slack is more in the mainstream of Salesforce's business than Twitter, it would still come at a hefty price given Slack's  $17 billion  market value before Wednesday's stock surge.

"Investors don't want Salesforce to do a big deal," Mr. Thill of Jefferies said, adding they want the company to show it can generate growth from within._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How Three TikTok Stars Beat Back U.S. Plans to Ban the App In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?

After more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.

The three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.

The lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.

It looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.

It was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.

ByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .

In August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.

The first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.

On  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.

"Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok," Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.

The U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would " necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency."

In a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: "We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so."

 One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.

The TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.

ByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.

Although President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.

For now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.

"It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits," said a senior administration official.

Ms. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. "I was so, so happy," she said.

"This entire experience has been one I'll never forget," said Mr. Marland. "It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures."

While TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.

In mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.

A key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.

The negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.

Executives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.

ByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.

Mr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .

Inside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.

TikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.

A deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.

The lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's "Without Me" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.

Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

"TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business," he said. "I felt like I needed to fight" for TikTok.

Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.

As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.

In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Chargepoint (SBE) upcoming catalyst events -- buy now or wait? So I think there's two major events coming up that may affect SBE's pricing:

* Completion of merger (end of Q4): I heard for most SPACs there's a big drop right after merger is complete as people take their profits. I don't think that will happen as much here, since Chargepoint actually has a good product that's already making money. But still, there's going to be a drop. How much do you think it will be? And is that the better time to get in instead of now?

* Georgia Runoff election (Jan 5): If the Democrats don't win that Senate race, are we still as bullish about Chargepoint? How much of the stock price depends on the 500,000 new charging stations promised by Biden? Even if Democrats do win, the Democrat's margin in house and senate are so small that can Biden really pass anything ambitious?

What do you think of SBE? Do you think that:

* Current price is still great for a short-term play (buy, pump, and dump before merger).
* Current price is still great for *long*-term investment. It's a good company and those catalyst events are not going to affect it one way or another.
* Current price is too high for long term investment, but waiting for catalyst event to buy back in is good long term play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you determine is a stock is past its hype Hi All,

In the book, it is mentioned that some numbers are essential in determining the company's past performance and the current quality. However, I have found that some of the ratios are difficult, if not impossible to interpret due to the negative output.

&#x200B;

For example, in many start-ups the operating cash flow and free cashflow can be negative. In this way, how to interpret the following ratios?

&#x200B;

* Growth in Operating Income per Fully Diluted Share

&#x200B;

§ ΔOI/FDS = 

&#x200B;

\[(operating income / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year\] 

&#x200B;

/ (operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Growth in Free Cash Flow per Fully Diluted Share

&#x200B;

§ ΔFCF/FDS =\[(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year\]

&#x200B;

 / (levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This cases can be as follows:

	1) The denominator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	2) The numerator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	3) Both the denominator and numerator are -ve, resulting in an +ve output

&#x200B;

How should we deal with these situations?

Let's just start with what REE is.   REE is rare earth elements,  I won't go into the details but basically think of permanent magnets.   They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you but as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are ally Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors & Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

- LOTS of factors such as EV, defense, China, and solar play all incorporated into one!!  Does it get batter than this?

I have around 7k USD in Tesla right now, which is basically all my savings, and as you all know it's been going up a lot since the announcement that they would be added to the S&P list.

Yesterday I figured that this growth would probably continue for the rest of December, since they still need to actually be added to the list. So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a loan with my bank for about 3k and invest it into Tesla. Because you know, leverage!

I believed this could play out in 2 ways.

1. Either Tesla goes up a bunch in the next month and I can pay back my loan with basically 0% interest and let the rest of my profit sit in Tesla.
2. Tesla doesn't go up immediately, or maybe even dip down a bit, and I just let my loan sit there. I have 18 months to pay it back and if I do that then it'll cost me 200 USD interest. But I feel relatively confident that in those 18 months I'll have made more than 200 USD from rising Tesla stock.

But this morning when I woke up I thought, hmmm, what if the stock actually plummets when they get added to the S&P list, because maybe that's the exact moment that a lot of people will think it's the best time to sell their Tesla stock to make some money. I'm a bit scared of that scenario. Even though maybe I have nothing to be afraid of if I just let my money sit there for the full 18 months.

I wonder what the experienced investors in this subreddit find the most likely scenario. Do you think it will keep going up when Tesla actually gets added to the S&P list? Or do you think it might plummet? Or just stay relatively stable?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which app do you guys recommend to people new to investing? Good morning from Spain.

“So what is Microvast?

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to ~$20 range.

Reminder: Gonna take a couple weeks before it moons (from merger agreement confirmation), BE PATIENT”

I've been a proponent of GM vehicles since 2013. Really liking the path that GM is taking with their EV vehicles. Their new battery tech seems promising and their valuations are low compared to other pure EV makers. My concern is can GM catch up to Tesla in the EV market?

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are < 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|

**EDIT: A note about compounding.** 

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What am I missing here with MET? Looking at Metlife, as of today it has an earnings per share of $6.12 and a price of $47.76, so a P/E of about 8.

Compared to the maybe outdated Ben Graham rule of price/earnings over 15 being expensive, a P/E of 8 seems like a bargain, unless I'm missing something important about the company or global insurance markets. 

To my understanding, Metlife got out of retail life insurance awhile ago to focus on corporate products, and they have an established global brand.  

So what's the downside keeping the price so low?

The earnings return over time would be 6.12/47.76 = 13%, assuming they can just maintain their past performance, which to me doesn't seem unlikely. 

And there's also a 3.78% dividend, at a pretty sustainable payout ratio of 29.41%.

So what's the catch?

A company that has to sell shares, borrow money, and requires credits to be profitable is now the 6th largest company in the S&P.

What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a "definitive agreement" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition "will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket."  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.
