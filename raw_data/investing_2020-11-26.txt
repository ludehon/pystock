 What % of your portfolio do you invest in single stocks? M(31) so after finally hitting a £100k milestone investing in mainly index funds I’ve decided to branch out and kind of take on a little bit more risk in hope for a little more reward by having a dabble with individual stocks. 
So far I have about 5% of my total investments in individual stocks stocks that are up in the regions of 18-50% in the present moment. Which is much more than my index funds. 

I’m just wondering how much you all put aside for individual stocks? And how much you would put into each individual stock? I understand everyone will have different opinions on this and I’m interested to hear!

“So what is Microvast?

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%.

Their new battery tech seems promising and their valuations are low compared to other pure EV makers. My concern is can GM catch up to Tesla in the EV market?

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are < 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What am I missing here with MET? Looking at Metlife, as of today it has an earnings per share of $6.12 and a price of $47.76, so a P/E of about 8.

Compared to the maybe outdated Ben Graham rule of price/earnings over 15 being expensive, a P/E of 8 seems like a bargain, unless I'm missing something important about the company or global insurance markets. 

To my understanding, Metlife got out of retail life insurance awhile ago to focus on corporate products, and they have an established global brand.  

So what's the downside keeping the price so low?

The earnings return over time would be 6.12/47.76 = 13%, assuming they can just maintain their past performance, which to me doesn't seem unlikely. 

And there's also a 3.78% dividend, at a pretty sustainable payout ratio of 29.41%.

So what's the catch?

With Teslas inclusion and enormous market cap, it now has a profound effect on the index. Tesla has surpassed Walmart and Berkshire in market cap. Think about that. A company that has to sell shares, borrow money, and requires credits to be profitable is now the 6th largest company in the S&P. Berkshire is buying shares, Tesla is selling them because they need money. Their market cap is $100 billion more than Walmart. Tesla had $24b in revenue all of last year. Walmart had $134b in revenue last *quarter* alone. Walmart owns $200b in real estate while Tesla cant even pay rent on time. Since that announcement the stock is up 35% and it hasn't even been added yet. More downside risk. I'm a fan of Tesla and I made a decent amount of money on their epic run but being the 6th largest company in the index opens up massive downside peril for passive funds.

On any given day, the odds of the market going up or down are not 50/50. Additionally, stock returns do not follow a normal distribution, as is commonly assumed in many models. On any given day, the market has roughly a 53 percent chance of rising. The odds of the market rising over longer periods increases continually as the time period you're looking at increases. Daily market returns are also streaky. You are statistically more likely to have multi-day winning streaks during uptrends. This plays into our hands.

A thing to remember - Total stock market returns are notoriously hard to forecast. *However, volatility is relatively easy to forecast.*

A award-winning paper I found is called "[Leverage for the long run](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)," and uses the 200-day moving average to forecast volatility.

The 200-day moving average method works shockingly well. We already know that 3x leveraged ETFs tend to do even better than 3x the market in low volatility markets and worse in high volatility markets. The trick to pocketing the extra return is to isolate the periods when volatility is most likely to occur. 

This is an amazing split. Volatility is almost twice as high when stocks are below their 200-day moving average than when they're above it.

This indeed allows us to isolate the instances when we are most likely to experience significant market declines and the times when 3x leverage is most likely to underperform the index due to volatility drag.

By doing this, you also are able to identify environments when market crashes are more likely to occur. As you can see, over two-thirds of the worst trading days for the market occur when the S&P 500 is trading below its 200-day moving average.

The 200-day moving average isn't just something recently cooked up, either. The idea of only owning stocks above the 200-day moving average has been around for a long time. Nobel prize-winning professor Jeremy Siegel covered the strategy in his book *Stocks for the Long Run* but ultimately concluded that the strategy returned less than buy-and-hold, albeit with less risk.

However, the increased effect of volatility drag on leveraged ETFs (and acceleration of returns in calm markets) flips the script on this assumption.

**The "*****Leverage for the Long Run"*** **strategy**

The moving average strategy proposed in the Pension Partners paper is pretty simple. As long as the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average, buy and hold UPRO. When the S&P 500 sinks below its 200-day moving average, rotate to cash.

You'd have avoided almost the entirety of the bear markets in 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 while catching the upside with 3x leverage. Valuations and growth do matter for this strategy as we can explain roughly [20 percent of the variation in future stock returns by valuation alone](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3995018-nifty-fifty-market-barometer) (typically the r-squared, a statistical measure of how much of y you can explain by x, is around 0.20), so going forward the optimal index to apply leverage to may not be the same. However, the trend following system really does work. 

Academic research shows that momentum strategies tend to outperform the market at large. Adding leveraged ETFs to the momentum factor is like pouring gasoline on the fire to returns of the 200-day moving average strategy. I feel that the simplest improvement to the trend following strategy is to use the Nasdaq rather than the S&P 500, as seen by the performance over time.

[The Nasdaq has outperformed the S&P 500 in roughly 60 percent of quarters going back to 1986](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9b63hi/nasdaq_100_vs_sp500_which_one/) and has a stronger exposure to the momentum factor. You can see in the first graph above how much of a difference this has made.

Additionally, instead of investing in cash instruments when the index is below the 200-day average, I'd think about rotating into long-term Treasury bonds ([TLT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT)) to take advantage of periods of risk aversion. We know that markets tend to see most of their worst days when stocks are below their 200-day average, and also that Treasuries tend to catch a bid as investors flee risky assets in downturns. This strategy would have significantly helped your returns in 2008. 

Additionally, I recommend a 1 percent band around the 200-day average to prevent being whipsawed as the market hovers near its 200-day average. Let it close 1 to 1.25 percent below before you sell and wait for it to go 1 percent above before you buy. Additionally, you may want to consider using the 150 or 175-day averages as they're less popular with traders. 200-day moving average traders are still smart money, but the fewer people you have selling when you want to sell and vice versa when you buy, the better. I'd use the moving average on the S&P even though we're trading the Nasdaq as it's a volatility forecaster, not a market timing model._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Square Stock Jumped 5% - Motley Fool Square has been a hot stock in recent months.

What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a "definitive agreement" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition "will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket."  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.
