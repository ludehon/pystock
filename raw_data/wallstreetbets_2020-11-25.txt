 PLTR got me some tendies today _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ YRD is going to the moon. I'm calling it now_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Someone told me y'all could help I was in Costco today just getting a few things and I ended up talking to some random guy. He first asked me, "hey, why are you in that wheelchair?" - I look pretty healthy despite being in one. So I told him I recently had prostate surgery done. They replaced my prostate and sphincter with some device that helps me go poo because the cancer got to it earlier this year. Thankfully after beating covid in the hospital they cleared a spot for me to have a surgery done before this "second wave" hit. Anyway, he probably thought I was autistic (I am) when we started talking about stocks and options. 

I've been super interested in options trading for a while but never really understood what it was. He broke it down for me in like ten minutes and told me to check out reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets. So I walked away to get a few more things and left Costco then came straight here. The guy understood my situation and said people would be willing to help me out.

So what I need help with is the starting money to trade these options. I need $15,000. My medical bills from the prostate surgery and cancer have bankrupted me completely but I've still been having to take my HIV/AIDS medication which, if you know, can be quite expensive. Not to mention the fact that I had a stroke induced seizure late last year. Generally I'm not in good health because I broke my back as a teenager and it caused me to have this painful needle-like sensation for fifteen years until a few years ago when I got rehab for it. The rehab strengthened my back and took care of the pain but they must have not been  good at their jobs because I tore my ACL in a soccer match just a few weeks later. 

Being autistic with HIV/AIDS, a brand new technological sphincter/prostate, a fucked up back, a debilitating stroke AND Parkinson's is just really tough but I don't want to give up. When they diagnosed me with Down's Syndrome a few years ago I was about ready to give up but as you can see I'm still here. My heart is StIlL BeAtInG and I'm not about to call it quits on options trading even though I've called it quits on heroin speedballs mixed with Adderall just a couple months after my depression kicked in when the lockdowns began.

So if you're interested in being a part of my success story, DM me and I'll give you my PayPal or Venmo so I can make an inspiring story that people can and will share to /r/progresspics. Thanks!

If you have any idea’s or questions about the strategy, please comment below. 

Lets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will “officially” be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesn’t publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.

After the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. 

Now that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.

So, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. 

[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)

Using the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  

The goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.

People who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they don’t want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  

So just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. 


A couple of suggestions:
1.)	Don’t swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high 
2.)	Look for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date 

Example: 

To start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 – 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. 

[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date – This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy – A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. 


dividend record-date – The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.This tutorial is the process that I go through using dividend stocks to find and evaluate my swing-trades every month.

For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 – 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. 

[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date – This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy – A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. 


dividend record-date – The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First time options day and it was beautiful So today was my first day to options, and I went in on a 40 dollar call for stacks.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

Now Let me tell you a story about Palantir and why it is so important. 

See, back in 1998, there were two internet payments company who were trying to make it big, one run by Peter Thiel and one run by Elon Musk. They eventually merged and created paypal. You can see the two of them here in the same picture. 

https://preview.redd.it/3ie03xvwgg161.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9368996a40228d96dae30a8d14c9a7b22d446a8

So why is paypal important. Well the Paypal mafia is known for building basically the entire post dot-com tech landscape that you know today. Yelp, youtube, square, linkedin, tesla/space X. And who is Peter Thiel, well, he is basically the smartest venture capitalist in the world and very well known in Silicon Valley. He was the first outside investor in facebook, he backed Tesla and SpaceX. 

So why does this matter? Well, Peter Thiel is one of the smartest men in the world. He was Chess grandmaster in his youth and he has a brilliant, contrarian mind. He foresaw the rise of SJW in the late 90s, this man either can predict the future or he is a time traveler. Either way, he is a savant. 

Now on to Palantir 

So why does this matter for Palantir. Peter founded Palantir in 2003. That was 17 years ago. What was his plan? Well, I think his plan is to create the next IBM. So hear me out. Well, historically the development of internet technology swung between enterprise and consumer. Prior to 2000, nobody in Silicon valley knew anything about consumer internet, everyone was busy chasing HP contracts or trying grab a DOD tender. But it swung to consumer for the next 20 years. He is making a calculating bet that consumer is played out and the next swing will be in the form of enteprise/government sales. 

And who was the big boss of enterprise/gov sales. Well it was IBM. See IBM wasn’t just the giant in computing that dominated from 1940-1980s, it started off selling office tools like punch cards and typewritters. They didn't have the best technology, but they had a big rolodex of government and corporate clients. When the computing revolution came around in the 1950s, it wasn't the best technology that won, but the one with the customer distribution. 

The same thing is happening with Palantir, they are doing manpower intensive work for governments and large corporates now, its not really a high margin scalable business (which is why wallstreet poo-hoos the stocks). But the thing is, they are positioned perfectly for the rise of AI. Much as the same way IBM was well positioned for the rise of computing. 

And that is why, PLTR will hit $500/share by 2030_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think I’m doing this wrong.

&#x200B;

As I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.

With all this as background, here's how to put this in perspective:

&#x200B;

"A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company."

&#x200B;

Furthermore...

&#x200B;

"...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall."

&#x200B;

So, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.

&#x200B;

In theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.

Position: Shares because I'm a risk averse Boomer_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 3 weeks ago I deposited $500 into my account: today my account sits at $27,000 of fully realized gains. The inspiring tale of an Autist's redemption. On November 2nd I deposited $500 into my TDA account (my Robinhood account is restricted, a story for a different day).  I was pissed, tilted, and just frustrated at my shitty decision making.  I decided to take a real hard look at myself and my trading, and then after careful consideration I made the decision to double down on absolutely ridiculous FDs.  [Today I cashed out my positions at $27,000 (I withdrew $13,000 so my balance shows that deficit)](https://imgur.com/a/9nSuJoI). Below is a brief summary of the key moves that I made, please excuse the absolutely atrocious TDA UI display.

First I jumped in on an SQ earnings play ([$455 to $1,925](https://imgur.com/a/HjLFHy1)), then hopped on the PLTR train and grabbed some weeklies ([$1,825 to $6,363](https://imgur.com/a/VQQcEvj)).  I started feeling myself a little and decided to gamble on WMT earnings, which didn't go so well ([$5,569 to $495](https://imgur.com/a/goy1nTj)).  With the rest of my money I decided to switch it up and jump into some TSLA weeklies ([$3,200 to $10,600](https://imgur.com/a/p5yJ72B)).  After some questionable 0DTE plays where I lost 75% of my money I buckled down and jumped into PLTR 11/25 FDs, which was by far my most lucrative play ([$2286 to $27,350](https://imgur.com/a/xfEQLX9)).

In a rare moment of lucidity I cashed out all my positions and withdrew half of my balance (the other half I will be putting into 12/4 NIO calls on Friday).  So what's the point of this story?  A simple one really: if an idiot like me who makes atrocious plays (as evidenced by the above screenshots) can somehow come up with 5400% returns in less then a month, so can you!

PLTR is one of the, if not, the only companies that are helping the government track Covid-19 data. They will also be tracking and handling the vaccine to make sure that everyone is able to get the vaccine. 

The distribution of the vaccine will also be heavily dependant on PLTR and how they handle everything.

The government will be spending boatloads of money on PLTR and now with Biden being in the Whitehouse, I wouldn't be surprised if they ramp up the amount of money going to PLTR since they are a key player in the Covid-19 situation.

Right now the many governments are coming to PLTR for help especially the U.S. government. The fat stacks of government cash should be coming in hot.

They have a disinfecting system called Altapure AP-4™. This is being used in select schools in PA and on one cruise ship currently. This will be the key to their success. With the return to school and normal life, sporting events, anything, disinfecting of all viruses including COVID is going to be required with Biden in office. BHTG already has the technology and it is already working in real-life scenarios.

When more institutions pick up on their technology and watch them fly.

Not to mention they had a public offering priced at 1.85 and they're currently only 1.35ish.

And a bonus note from their latest earnings report:"Made strategic investment in Rensselaer, NY land venture as a material step to establishing a renewable energy campus, including New York state's first waste conversion facility"

And let me tell you, the numbers I found in there, literally makes my bull cock hard. Let me show you why in this post.

For this analysis I will first start off with a general intro into Roblox; more specifically, I will talk about what it is, what it does, and how it makes its revenue. Then I will examine the micro factors by looking at the company’s financial statements and identify any notable patterns and items of interest that can affect future profitability. Let’s begin.

**What Is Roblox And Where Does Its Money Come From**

Roblox started off in 2004 as a platform for human co-experience which is done in user-generated 3D digital worlds that the company considers to be the “new form of social interaction” (*This part is key, social interaction, it is what sets Roblox apart from a lot of these gaming and social media companies that I will get to later on)*. From there, growth at the company is driven primarily from investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social. This means that the more high-quality content the users create, the more additional users are attracted to the platform, and the cycle repeats. While this is going on, the company profits off of this through two main revenue streams: the sale of its virtual currency Robux *(Its primary source of revenue)*, and subscription to Roblox Premium. Both of these I will get into later on.

Putting all of this together means the company is **NOT** a gaming company like EA, nor is it purely a social media or user-generated content company like Facebook or YouTube; rather, the company is a mix of all three. I say this because unlike a traditional gaming company like EA who spends millions each year developing a new game that may or may not turn into shit with their fanbase *(every A.C game after Ezio)*, Roblox just sits back, relax, and let their own content creators do the heavy lifting by creating games on their platform which draws in the users, which in turn purchases the microtransactions on Robux and subscribes to Roblox Premium.

Now, the reason why I say Roblox is similar in some sense to Facebook and YouTube is that on Roblox you to can create friends and social groups with people you meet in real life and on their virtual world. There you can exchange ideas, build worlds together, or just play games and chat to each other. Much like a Facebook account, some people log on to Roblox purely to chat with their friends for extended periods of time. Now in terms of YouTube, the biggest similarity Roblox has with the content creating company is that Roblox’s content creators are **PAID** **and paid well.** In 2020, its content creators are estimated to make $250m, that’s more than double the $110m they made in 2019 (*The money Roblox pays to its content creators are called Developer Exchange Fees on their S-1*). The creators earn money whenever a user spends their virtual currency in one of their games **and** how much time premium users spend in their games. For some of their games, Roblox will share as much as 70% of the proceeds with the content creators [(https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/#:\~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in%2Dgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/(https:/venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/%23:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in-game)). So unlike YouTube, where they try to penny pinch anyway they can, Roblox actually recognizes that their content creators are the key to their growth strategy and will make sure that they are well compensated in order to sustain their growth engine and judging on the fact that their daily active user (DAU) growth is a whopping **96.86%** YoY based on their Q3 figures, it’s probably a winning strategy (*page 107 of S-1*).

Lastly, it is also important to note that a lot of the growth in DAU and bookings is driven by the pandemic lockdowns, but a look into the company’s operating metrics will show that the company has enjoyed significant growth in users, hours engaged, and bookings well before the pandemic, which means that the company should be able to continuously grow at a significant pace even post covid.

**TL;DR** Any analyst saying Roblox is a ‘gaming’ company is the equivalent of them saying Tesla is just another ‘automobile’ company and giving it a $200PT ([Roblox S-1 IPO filing released - cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/roblox-s-1-ipo-filing-released.html)). They’re retarded and so are you if you’re listening to them. Roblox is a mix of a gaming and social media company with explosive growth in DAU.

&#x200B;

**The Financials**

***Balance Sheet***

Looked at the statement and its absolutely fucking solid. Here is a snapshot so you know I’m not pulling this out of my ass.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hwqw0i74tf161.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcfbd4c78af77777b555a046d08ff922f2979ad4

As you can see, both current(1,212,259) and total assets(1,489,541) are greater than their current(904,302) and total liabilities(1,436,664). This means this company is both liquid and solvent so it is strong on a balance sheet perspective. One liability I want to focus on however is their deferred revenue, which is by far the largest liability the company has on their balance sheet. For all you non-accountants out there, deferred revenue is unearned revenue, meaning they received payment for a service that they have yet to provide. For Roblox, that service refers to the perks that come from the purchases of Robux or subscription to Roblox Premium. The company also refers to the purchase of Robux as bookings and will accrue these liabilities and the revenue generated from them over the average lifetime of a paying user which is 23 months(*page 23 of S-1*). This means that this liability will not result in future cash outflow, which means the company will be less restricted in investing more into itself or continue to pay its content creators.

**TL;DR**: Company is solid based on balance sheet fundamentals. Their largest liability is their unearned/deferred revenue which isn’t going to create a cash outflow that will impact future investments.

**Income Statement**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mphvkz9ctf161.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c416e32fc628b5f29e58091be1e993c7ce0bf13

The first thing you are going to notice is the explosive revenue growth of 68% (588,675 / 349,888) which shows that the company is doing really well during the pandemic. In addition, the company is able to keep its core operating expenses growth stable to its revenue growth while keeping its other expenses such as G&A and Sales/Marketing to a bare minimum. This shows that the management of Roblox knows how to run a tight ship. In addition, it can be argued that a lot of these expenses are really an investment into the company’s own future, such as paying content creators (Developer exchange fees), investing in infrastructure, and research and development. Honestly, I would prefer the company to run up losses on these expenses early on in order to help scale its growth than to have them do it later on.

**TL;DR:** Revenue growth is high for years and the majority of expenses are attributed to the company investing those proceeds into the business and its operations which in turn will help fuel future growth.

**Conclusion**

This is a truly unique company that combines all the best characteristics of the gaming, social media, and content creation industries. The company has solid fundamentals, strong revenue, and user growth, and will most likely significantly scale their business upwards for the foreseeable future.  Even though this company is most likely going to turn into a WSB meme, the fundamentals themselves support large price appreciation in the stock.

Get in retards.

I plan to buy stocks when they IPO, and switch half my holdings into leap calls when options become available.

At best things will be flat, and IV will crush on your crsr, ,nio, and pltr fds. Even Leaps too! Most leaps have >100% IV.

Tldr: don’t buy stocks at all time highs that have quadrupled in two months with massive IVs_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ where are my PLTR boys? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UVXY, and VXX Lotto Play (possible 1000 percent) The VIX has hit a bottom, it has been slowly bleeding since all the election volatility went away. Well, there is now a new opportunity to enter the the VIX and make quite a lot. Since Thanksgiving is coming up and people are expecting almost no one to respect guidelines to avoid gathering as we can see through air traffic data. The volume of flights has exploded, we are going to see the largest surge of coronavirus ever. The news headline on Friday market open, "Covid-19 cases expected surge following Thanksgiving" or next weeks headline will show corona cases already having surged. Regardless cases are going to go up significantly and we will have a short time spike in volatility once again.

The thing is, I could also see the markets totally ignoring all Covid news so it is a 50/50. We are at all time highs and the market seems like it is due for a pull back as well. The play I am about to suggest is definitely more a lotto type play but there is extremely high potential.

&#x200B;

I recommend UVXY 12C Dec 4, and VXX 18C Dec 4 or Dec 11

If you want to go full retard, then get the 11/27 calls. Odds are there will be no news about Thanksgiving case surges by Friday but if there is these contracts can easily 10x.

You sit on the toilet to check your PLTR calls, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes of green PLTR dildos. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen.

Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.

Edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 15c 12/18_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why retards should consider JMIA with PLTR I have taken some numbers from reports available online, firstly  
In May 2019, Citron exposed the problems at Jumia Technologies (JMIA) that included: 

• Discrepancies in financials between investor presentations and SEC filings   
• Fraudulent orders   
• A company burdened with inefficiencies   


However, as Citron themselves have stated, now everything has changed. Starting an e-commerce business in an emerging market will have its challenges, the rewards can be great for patient investors as we’ve seen with MELI, BABA and SE. Over the past year, the pandemic has accelerated the global shift to e-commerce and JMIA has benefited from:   


• Acceleration of e-commerce adoption by Nigerian consumers   
• The renewed focus on profitability   
• The rapid acceptance of fintech products in Nigeria including JumiaPay   
• The ability to use JMIA has a platform for ancillary products    


There is no denying that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated e-commerce globally. JMIA is the key beneficiary as it is the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa. You can’t deny the numbers:   


• 1.3 billion population   
• 523 million internet users   
• Fastest growing continent in the world that will account for >50% of global population growth between now and 2050   
• McKinsey estimates that Africa e-commerce will grow to a $75 billion market opportunity by 2025   
• In Nigeria, over 40% of the population is under the age of 14 and over 50% of registered voters are under the age of 35   


As analysts have said, "EITHER THESE YOUNG NIGERIANS WILL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE ON EARTH TO NOT ACCEPT E-COMMERCE OR THE STOCK IS GOING TO $100"  


JMIA Pay  
One of the largest criticisms of conducting e-commerce in Africa was the continent’s reliance on a cash economy, which is obviously not e-commerce friendly. JMIA has created their own digital currency – think PayPal, which now accounts for 24% of GMV and 36% of orders. Last month, McKinsey’s comments on the future of fintech can also be applied to e-commerce: “A youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.” The takeaway is no matter who wins in fintech, JMIA and e-commerce are winners.   


Forget about valuation and look more at significance. The country of Nigeria is dedicated to making e-commerce work to increase the quality of life of their growing and sizeable population. Consider this – JMIA is now shipping over 20 million packages a year to cities and rural areas across 11 countries. Nigeria is benefiting from the logistics network, technology and product offerings that JMIA has brought to this long overlooked part of the world. JMIA is at the epicenter of this movement and the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy the dip or take the profits?

I went in on some USO leap calls when the oil prices first crashed.  They're expiring 1/21/22, with strike price of $4.5.  Since purchasing, there was a 8 way split, and my options now show for USO1.  Here's where I get lost...$4.5 x 8 = $36.  My USO1 calls show a value of $0.33 each, but if I go into USO options, a 1/21/22 call for $36 shows a value of $3 each.  What am I missing here?  If I sell my old calls they're worth $33 but if I were to buy the same calls now they're $300?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JMIA is a joke and will need to raise cash, or die trying to become profitable. Yolo'd call last month up 700% now yolo-ing puts for DEC18. Last month i bought calls for JMIA and made 700% on the calls. The stock has a predictable pattern of ups and downs so i bet up. was right. but now it's time for the down turn. However we are dealing with some unique forces because a few idiots like Citron and other MSNBC homos think it's going to be the next AMZN. Besides all of u/yoinkedmustache points here ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts\_on\_nigerian\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts_on_nigerian_scam/) ) there are additional reasons why JMIA is a bad company, which i think is why they've had to release a beautifully-designed powerpoint deck full of irrelevant bullshit numbers (with a focus on percentages, not the magnitude of their paltry numbers) to keep the confusion and bs charade going.

\-GMV is down by 15%. AMZN never once had a year where GMV was down from the year prior.

\-They have EUR 147M in cash, but their 9 month operating loss is EUR 109M. They spend EUR 72M in G&A costs (tech, execs, etc.) in 9 months. They need to raise cash. 

\-They've slowed down on advertising (sounds like they're reaching their limit around EUR 150M in annual revenue)

\-All of their bullshit about user growth is because they keep adding verticals like food delivery, JumiaPay, gaming, etc. which are not likely to be profitable either.

\-Their 'business mix rebalancing' is a masterclass in stupidity. To turn the focus to fashion, beauty, home & living, FMCG away from difficult to find products like electronics is not going to work. 

   \>The move to fashion, beauty, home & living, and FMGC seems smart for two reasons. 

\+Firstly, as a consumer, you don't really need to worry about the quality of fashion products or FMGC, either it's built into the brand (Proctor & Gamble) or its a t-shirt/shoes and you don't really need to be concerned with the 'quality' of a t-shirt or shoes (they don't cost $1000 nor are they going to explode upon opening). Trust is one of the two biggest issues facing JMIA, the other being the unnecessity of shopping online Africa, where small shops line neighborhoods.

\++Study done which shows Africans have lower "interpersonal trust" than pretty much anywhere else in the world ([https://ourworldindata.org/trust](https://ourworldindata.org/trust)), which is not good for e-commerce.

\+ Secondly, the sellers of these products are typically smaller 'independent' businesses who JMIA can extract higher commissions from. 30% of total items sold on JMIA in 2019 were fashion or beauty products which are designed and manufactured by small local companies. The sellers also want an outlet to sell their products.

\-With the pivot toward fashion/beauty product they've brilliantly increased their competition with Facebook's suite of products (FB, Instagram, WhatsApp), which are wildly popular in Africa.

\-They're also competing with the millions of tiny little shops on the sides of the road, which are scattered across neighborhoods and main roads, which don't require you to wait, pay a delivery fee, or   worry about delivery, waste your time opening the app, etc.

I'm sure there are 30 other reasons to short the shit out of the stock, but what is more a sign of death than slowing down growth when your an e-commerce platform in a market of 1.5B people (and you only have like 1-2% of the market as 'active users' which is a metric for anyone who bought something one-time in 12 months...to 'focus on profitability'._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR Buying Opportunity $43/share CRSR Buying opportunity it literally just fell to about $43 and was $50 last close.

For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**

But boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**

So what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.

Curve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.

I don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.

Ligand Pharma is currently experiencing ***accelerating*** growth, 55% revenue growth in 2020 and projecting about **67%** revenue growth in 2021. The company owns a bunch of pharma tech, that shitty biotech uses to build their drugs in return for some % of the proceeds in royalties. They have a strong cash position as well **with fucking cash reserves of $800 million on a 1.4B market cap.** 

If the drug comes to market, LGND just rakes that shit in. If the drug fails testing, fuck it, it doesn't matter. One of these drugs is the COVID drug **REMDESIVIR** that uses their captisol tech**.** 

Vaccine or not, a metric fuckton of people will get Covid in the coming months, and each one of them and their mom is demanding the presidential treatment. Doctors are prescribing this shit hand over fist so they don't get sued out of their ass if a patient dies without getting remdesivir. Gilead isn't making shit from it, but LGND is raking it in. 

About 50% of their current revenue is coming from captisol, and remdesivir has been a huge advertisement for that tech. They also have another 8 partnered drugs coming out of phase 3 clin trials soon, and are projecting abt a **50%** increase in royalties next year which is essentially gives em a **100%** margin on that revenue. 

Moving away from that shit into the stock price, the stock price is confusing analysts too. Last ER call we got a Q 

>Great. Thanks. And then, another question, this is little, pardon me, a little more challenging, but you came out of the analyst event, provided some pretty impressive growth on targets for the next, call it, two to three years and really highlighting how the business is going to shift more and see more growth on the royalty side or I think you can argue, you are going to get more of a valuation benefit for your stock.  
>  
>But the stock didn’t react that way. And I am curious, what were your thoughts on that reaction? And what do you think investors are missing that might fill that gap? Thank you.

to which the CEO basically said they're sandbagging guidance. 

The stock has an INSANE amt of short interest, **69%** of the stock is held short even with strong YOY growth, guidance for next year beat and raising consensus estimates, and an intact growth story for the years to come. Any kindof good news gonna lead to a short squeeze that'll bring LGND popping over $120. *The downside is low, the upside is immense.*

The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022.

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

Bears, please check in. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB is the price discovery mechanism for the market Imagine for a moment a gray world. A world where no child laughs or flower blooms. A world dominated totally by Index Funds and ETFs.

In this world, not a single transaction in the market buys or sells an individual security. Vast majority of investment happens on a schedule, with parts of peoples' paychecks swallowed by giant investment companies that charge a small fee. A predictable, sterile world.

And that is the world we were heading towards (meme article from 2019 just so that this can be marked as research and not a typical shitpost - [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/passive-investing-now-controls-nearly-half-the-us-stock-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/passive-investing-now-controls-nearly-half-the-us-stock-market.html))

Enter, /r/wallstreetbets

WSB is the antithesis to all of that. Instead of completely ignoring the price of individual securities and praying that the entire market will provide, WSB is about yoloing it all on the slightest hint of research, hype, or occasionally fundamentals. Essentially WSB is a nascent price discovery mechanism in its own right.

At this point all of this sounds convincing but you might protest - but what about the short sellers!? The brave men and women who do amazing research to uncover what lies beyond piles of bs a good number of companies generate as pr. And to that I can say - so what? Doing all of that work with noone in the market to take action on it is like singing church hymns at a rock concert. At best you'll be ignored, at worst you'll be thrown out.

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data-warehousing company that was founded in 2012. 

Market Cap:  81.40B 

PLTR - Palantir Technologies is a public American software company that specializes in big data analytics. Founded in 2003 

Market cap - 44.13B

Both companies use data analytics for clients to analyse large data sets. Snowflake offers a platform. PLTR offers a specialised solution to each client. Different business models. Same solution.

The numbers:

PLTR - Quarterly revenue: Est:  289.37M

SNOW -  Quarterly revenue: Est: 33.14M

Cash on hand :

PLTR -  1.8B  
SNOW -  138.9M  
   
PLTR  3x Revenue of SNOW, Better product tailored to clients needs, involved in both public and private sector,  stronger financials. IMO better company, but has went under the radar from money managers until ARKK and Cathie Woods made a move this week - Big money is now analysing this stock and will be moves this weekend.

The reason PLTR is mooning isn't because of speculation it's because the stock is still grossly undervalued.

This is what I am seeing on Spy / ES_F that is a little concerning.  SPY 1D chart we can see that the candle on Novemeber 16th closed at 362.27 with a respective RSI of 63.18.  Then yesterday the candle closed at 363.22 with a respective RSI close of 61.44.  So comparing those two tops yesterday the Price closed higher, but RSI closed lower. This is somewhat concerning as it shows weakness at all time highs which is not what you want to see.  With that said we would need to see today's candle close red to confirm the RSI divergenc.  Additionally RSI is sitting right above 60 which is typically the bull control zone, but if RSI croses back below 60 I could see things getting a bit more bearish. 

For those who complain I didn’t give them a trade, learn to take TA and make your own decisions.

Here's the deal folks, in the words of the great Doctor Disrespect, we're at the tippity top of the mountain but we're only halfway up. Do your own DD but I want to be clear that I believe this stock hits $40 or $50 when the test flights take place.

Essentially the situation is this: the final two test flights prior to Richard Branson flying to space were scheduled for last week. Of course, us mavericky Mericans refuse to wear a mask lest it inhibit our intake of Freedom Brand Oxygen and so the state now is under a mandatory 2 week shutdown, delaying the flights. 

Enter my favorite indie band: Papa Joe Buyden and the Vaccines

Virgin Galactic's stock is on a fucking tear, and while it may be due for a small dip or correction , it will re-enter the test flight window at a higher price than it would have last week. 

If you don't think the press coverage around a successful test flight will be bananas you're out of your mind. Yes, Space X does spaceflight too, but these are flights that are open to the public next year. Random rich people are going to become astronauts, starting with Richard Branson. While SpaceX plans similar trips in the future, they're way down the line, and also still a private company.

Despite what y'all might think, the Robinhood trading community is bigger than this subreddit, and if you don't think normies watching CNBC aren't going to pile into a stock that literally launches rich and famous people into space with 4k RTX on 360 degree cameras in the cabin you're out of your God damn mind.

Add in the fact that shorts *love* to play with this stock, and there's a very good chance that this stock gets gobbled up by retail, hyped by press, and launched to Pluto by a short squeeze. The shorts will pile in at this price, and hold forever because they're awful at taking profits. 

Get in now, wait for the dip, ignore this entirely - I don't care. But I've been following this stock for nearly a year now and I've personally got nearly $30k down on this bet.

* Asana helps companies stay on track with project management tools.
* Asana can help companies both large and small.
* Asana was a direct listing (they don't need cash).
* Customer retention for long time periods is really high.

Asana is currently getting past their IPO-woes, and the stock is well-positioned to shoot up over the next few months with positive earnings and outlook.

Asana has some competition, but they suck. Also, Asana's marketcap is low enough where a buyout by Microsoft or Salesforce is reasonable in the next 2 years.

Proof that you still can find good DD on WSB._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on SWBI as an earnings (12/02) play? I'm thinking this might be a good play for earnings but i'm looking for outside opinions.

&#x200B;

Currently SWBI's ATH is at $31, and it's currently trading at $15, and has been consolidating for the past couple of months where it fell from $28. The ATH was mainly a product of people buying guns due to fear of democratic policies taking guns away, so in light of that, people bought *more* guns figuring that it would be their last chance to do so. [There's talk on the street that biden will be even more anti-gun than Obama, who has floated around the idea of doing gun buybacks](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-deputy-chief-staff-mandatory-buyback-assault-weapons-gun-control). [There's no chance in hell this happens with a split government, but the news is enough to drive gun buying.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2020/11/19/president-elect-biden-brings-a-boost-to-gun-sales/?sh=1280d4ea258f)

&#x200B;

As many of you know, ammo has been sold out for months. My thinking is that going to buy ammo is like going grocery shopping, we often go for a couple of things, but walk out with a bunch of other things we also didn't need. Meaning if people are rushing to the store to go buy ammunition, the chances are astronomically higher that they'll buy guns simply due to the exposure. There is some evidence to support that thesis, [just in october firearm background checks surged 42%.](https://www.newsweek.com/firearm-background-checks-surge-42-percent-october-2016-us-headed-general-election-1548197) [They previously surged in march over 300%.](https://www.guns.com/news/2020/03/25/americans-want-firearms-gun-background-checks-up-over-300) There has also been a crazy active hunting season, because hunting is one of the only "safe" socially distanced activities one can do. So as you can see, gun ownership is rising with no end in sight.

&#x200B;

I think this means this will skyrocket come December 2nd when earnings are reported. There is a high short float for this stock so i think we'll see tons of covering.

&#x200B;

Guns are back on the menu boys. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR GETS CONTRACT WITH MARS _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The top is in (seen in a women's fitness group) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here's a post that's not about PLTR - CRDF up 3x this month. Jump in before we get to 10x I don't know when I bought these shares, but I had this random ticker in my account for the past year or so, doing nothing, then all of a sudden, it started going up. So I bought some calls too. And somehow, it actually kept going up!

CRDF 2/19 12.5

After that I decided I should look up the company and see what tf it actually is. Cardiff Oncology. WHOA!! it's gonna cure cancer or something. That's awesome. Maybe even better than a battery powered car or spying software or whatever that Palantir makes (and no knock on PLTR, I'm balls deep)

Buy now. LEAPS? sure. Stocks? Boring, but yes. Short term calls? The premium isn't great, but these could print too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The boring way to make (almost) guaranteed money (LONG AS FUCK, you've been warned) I know that this is a casino/circus/Wendy's, but hear me out.  Anyone who can't read or gets exhausted easily: you'll probably want to stop here.

There was a [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/) that really put into words what I've been trying to explain to people who don't understand why the market keeps going up despite all reason and logic, and this ties into a process I've been using (pretty successfully) to make realized money (the kind you can spend on things) instead of potential money (which is great for karma, but not much else).

Instead of doing all the DD and research and market analysis, I have adopted what I am calling the surfing model (this may already be a thing but I don't have a finance degree): buy-in (on anything -- no DD) when the MACD-value crosses above the MACD-avg, and RSI is sub-70.  On acquisition, immediately set a trailing-stop @ -XX%.  That's it.  I don't care what the company is, I don't care what it does; I don't need to.  I am only buying to sell for a profit and the MACD trigger is a good indicator that value is about to increase.

Here's one of our favorite meme stocks (SPY) in action:

[MACD-value \(middle, blue\), MACD-avg \(middle, yellow\), RSI \(bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/2c2ef82c2f161.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0f0612b69c33b071ced1b35524133ca6a4cbcf)

&#x200B;

So why do we use a trailing-stop instead of just selling when the MACD reverses itself?  Because MACD is less granular than the actual value of an asset and may stay steady even with a significant dip in price.  For example, PLTR saw a +10% retraction leading up to earnings, at which point you would have sold your shares (like I did), and then be able to re-buy them (at a profit) $1.86 lower:

[PLTR went from $15 something to $13 something day of ER; if you'd sold and then listened to Warren Buffet you'd have regained all your initial shares plus earned tendies @ \~$1.80\/share.](https://preview.redd.it/n2y18sd43f161.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11879ff59c07f1796aeafc29ab7f20418b80795)

&#x200B;

Of course, this model does have limitations.  This is the surfing model because when you surf, you have to catch the wave at the right point, or you miss is completely.  This means no buying into existing trends, no chasing shit that's already taken off, and no FOMO (which can be a good thing -- if you always wonder why when you buy something it immediately crashes, this is for you).

This also means you could have to wait for a long time to jump into something or miss out out on potential profits, as demonstrated by NIO:

[NIO's wave started back in October \~$24; you'd miss out on 100&#37;+ returns with this model.  Most underlying positions do not have these legs and this model is more focused on delivering consistent returns and less so with potential missed opportunity.](https://preview.redd.it/6ef57jb45f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d9ebcec4463705fb80c5e10261f2ec8904e98c2)

&#x200B;

So we've used all clown stocks up to this point; what about boomer stocks and options?  Same thing:

[Even F plays by the rules; remember this is buying on market momentum and let other retards spend all their time doing DD and analysis -- all the lights turn green?  BUY!](https://preview.redd.it/sfwl67pn6f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=362b7f282178a5c84282be56f7c0acf3144d50db)

&#x200B;

The trailing-stop set @ -XX% is the market's way of telling you you've probably gotten the best of the wave and it's time to catch a new one (or buy the dip and get tendies as demonstrated in the PLTR example above).  Sure, it may continue on but more than likely you have more opportunities elsewhere (remember stocks/options/companies are cattle, not pets -- use them to make money and move on.  If you're *<insert-meme-stock-here>-gang* you're doing it wrong).

For quick in/out I roll with -5%.  Positions I think have longer term value despite fluctuations I'll set -10% but I NEVER (don't have anything I think is worth that amount of loss) go more than -20%; that's like market/underlying collapse territory and you want to peace the fuck out if that triggers and then buy the bottom.

In addition to protecting profits, this also protects you from gross losses.  PING went all green last week so I jumped in.  It then proceeded to go red dildo and triggered my -5% trailing-stop below what I bought it for.  Instead of getting wiped out, I lost 5% and moved onto something else.  Small losses are manageable and will reduce your tax liabilities.  Huge losses take you out of the game.

Well, if you've made it this far; congrats and good luck.  If you have a system that works awesome for you by all means keep using it.  If you're getting bounced around and can't keep track of what the latest meme stock is or what we're transitioning into/out of, go back through any underlying and see if this model makes you money (yay back-testing!)

EDIT:

Hey look; real-world example!  WORK just spiked b/c of buy-out news and then dropped; trailing-stop adjusted for the spike and then got me out @ $37.20/share, which I could now re-buy @ $36-something for +$1 profit/share:

My first post here but I’m coming in with a good opportunity for you retards. K Technology makes some tiny ass cars and they’re pretty ugly but that didn’t stop your broke asses from buying crap like a Toyota Yaris. These cars are ultimately so cheap that there is no doubt gonna be sales, especially to fudge packing hipsters in San Fran. They’re already cleared for California roads and are starting deliveries in December and are going to announce openings of dealerships in America soon. K has also started developing battery swapping tech to make up for their relatively low ranges. They only have a market cap of about a billion which is extremely light considering they’re about to roll out cars in less than a month. I can see it going to at least 20-25 before EOY Seeing how they’re already on a come back after the huge EV burst these last two days shows how strong of a backing it has. I also know they just diluted their shares and issued under market value. This was to get cash for R&D to create a sports car as well as push for earlier deliveries.
