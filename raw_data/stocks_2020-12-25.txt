An Air Canada Boeing 737-8 Max on a test flight suffered engine issues that forced the crew to shut down one of the plane’s engines and make an emergency landing in Tucson, Arizona, Aviation24.be reported.

Shortly after takeoff, the crew received an indication of hydraulic low pressure in the left engine, the website said. The three-member crew of the empty plane initially decided to continue the flight to Montreal, but shut down the engine and diverted to Tucson after receiving an indication of a fuel imbalance from the left-hand wing, Aviation24.be said.

The incident took place Dec. 22, according to the report.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration permitted the 737 Max to return to the skies in November, after a 20-month hiatus prompted by a pair of fatal crashes.

Homes up 100% in a year.

Homes that were listed for 200k in 2018 and didn’t sell now being re listed at 400k.

If you ask realtors/mortgage officers they will tell you everything is fine and this will continue for years to come...

Their basic argument is that 

1. There’s tons of cash buyers who will bid up home prices for years and years to come

2. “Subprime” loans are no longer a thing. So people with mortgages can all still afford their homes if they lose their jobs etc

My issues with the above:

1. There’s no way there’s enough cash buyer demand to sustain 30% price increases for another 5 years. And if market runs out of cash buyers, financed buyers can only borrow so much (based on income, savings and appraisal of homes)

2. Sure we don’t lend to some guy with 500 credit so that his monthly payment is 50% his monthly income... instead we lend to a guy with 750 at a monthly payments that’s 50% his income... it’s not technically a subprime mortgage but it’s fundamentally the same issue (lending people the the brink of what they can afford)

From what I understand, the only difference is with exercising you're actually buying the 100 shares when if you sell, you just gain the intrinsic value.

I am asking this because I notice a company initiated buyback over a period of time and share price drops. After buyback stops, the share price then increases.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ocugen analysis #OCUGEN

Hello everyone, since it is the Christmas season, I have done up an analysis on a company called Ocugen which recently partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop COVAXIN. Before I begin, please do your own DD before purchasing of stocks and do not fully rely on my analysis.

##What is Ocugen?
Ocugen is a leading biopharmaceutical company which focuses on discovering, developing and transformative therapies to treat diseases such as blindness. Their breakthrough technology was the modification of gene therapy which has the potential to treat multiple retinal diseases with just one drug.

On the 22nd of December, Ocugen partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop the India-based company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the US Market. Under the partnership terms, Ocugen would have the US rights to the vaccine candidate and will be responsible for clinical development, registration and commercialization in the US market.

## Update as of today 
https://www.livemint.com/science/health/indian-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-has-drawn-global-attention-icmr/amp-11608855811924.html

Based on the article above, the Indian vaccine is getting attention from the media and I believe that reporters are starting to be aware of what they are doing.

1) Data generated from phase I and II showed that the vaccine itself is impressively safe, and it has spark Lancet's interest in publishing them. The phase III trial in India is currently ongoing at 22 sites.

2) The last date of enrolment of Phase III would be on 31st December, and we will determine the results by then. If it is successful, then investors like you and I will watch the vaccine being rolled out worldwide.

https://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/bhopal-after-giving-1700-volunteers-first-covaxin-dose-second-to-be-given-from-dec-26 

Based on the article above, Bharat Biotech is currently at the Phase 3 of its clinical trials and the first dose has been administered to over 1700 volunteers and it will start giving its second on 26th December. 

https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/bharat-bio-seeks-marketing-nod-again-for-its-vaccine/amp_articleshow/79946393.cms

Based on the article above, Bharat Biotech has recruited over 13,000 volunteers which is half-way mark of recruitment of 26,000 participants for phase III clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/24/2150312/0/en/Ocugen-Establishes-Vaccine-Scientific-Advisory-Board.html

Based on the article above, the Scientific advisory board consists of established and experienced management levels. It consist of Big players who works in Pfizer

Based on Shanker’s linkedin, he worked for Pfizer for 14 years as their senior director and then became CEO of Nuron which is a vacinne maker. Based on such management level, doesn't it help to build a strong foundation for the company? A simple fundamental to start investing in a company is to have good management team and this checks the box.

## Key efficacy of Bharat Biotech Vaccine
1) Vaccine - Inactivated Virus
2) Percentage of people who developed antibodies - 98.3%
3) Antibody levels - Comparable (1x)
4) Prevalence of serious side effects - None reported
5) Current stage of development - In phase III trial

At the outset, it shows that the vaccine may be comparable or even slightly better than its peers on some parameters. When volunteers are given COVAXIN, 98.4% of them developed antibodies compared at day 56 to 100% at day 28 after the two-dose regimen in the Coronavac trial, based on phase 2 trial data.

## Conclusion
To conclude, I hope that this fundamental analysis will allow the people who FOMO-ed into the stock to have a peace of mind.

For those that have rip, congratulation and hope that you will rip more profit from it.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

# Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

# Industry

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Cloud computing and gaming:

If you think that cloud computing will gain widespread adoption in the medium to long-term, significantly reducing the need for consumers of purchasing high-performance systems and components._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it a good time to invest or are we in a bubble? Hi Everyone,

I know I am late to the game but I wanted to see if you think this is still a good time to invest in different stocks and etf?

I mostly invested in index funds until last month. I invested almost 10k in different stocks and few Vanguard etfs in December. I see that almost every stock I look at went up in November. I started investing as everyone I knew is talking about how much they made. I have rudimentary understanding of how to go research a compare etf but mostly went with the popular ones.

I plan on leaving the money untouched for next 5 years. I do love actively managing but I don’t need to sell them in near future.

My conviction was Netflix seemed to be one of the stronger FAANG stocks that could benefit from COVID due to the increase in streaming and people staying home but it looks like it hasn't.

My question is, should I sell all my shares and move them to EV/energy stocks where we're seeing ATHs in the sector? Or with the vaccine out now, should I just stand with my conviction?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
