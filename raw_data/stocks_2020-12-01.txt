"Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Tesla shares continue to trade at all-time highs, and the stock will join the S&P 500 later this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees on Tuesday warning them that they need to control their spending in order to continue squeaking out quarterly profits, even though shares of Tesla are trading at all-time highs ahead of the company's inclusion in the S&P 500.

This year, among other things, Tesla began spending to build a new factory near Austin, Texas, and another near Berlin. The company also embarked on a makeover of its paint facilities, which are part of its U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.

"Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Electric vehicle news site Electrek previously reported the contents of Musk's email.

In early 2020, amid sluggish auto sales the world over, Tesla cut some employees' pay temporarily, slashed contracts with temporary workers and fired an undisclosed number of workers after an annual performance review process. It has since rehired contractors and restored employee pay.

The Tuesday e-mail echoes previous statements by Musk but does not specify how Tesla plans to mind its budget.

On the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts and shareholders, "We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it."

But on that same call, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla plans to ramp up its capital expenditures by $2 billion versus its prior stated plans to $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. Among other things, he said, the increased spending would enable Tesla to "in-source" things like some of its battery cell manufacturing.

Tesla raised $5 billion in September through an equity raise but needs to pay down about $1 billion in this, its fourth, quarter related to converts.

Shares of Tesla were trading above $580 ahead of the market's close on Tuesday.

(I will preface this with the fact that I am I complete newbie with stocks, only just now getting into it at 24. I‚Äôm a nurse working charge of a covid unit- we‚Äôre seeing a second wave, but I see hope soon on the horizon.)

I‚Äôve been doing a small amount of research at various stocks and how they have been affected by the pandemic. Most who are able to accommodate and were only tangentially affected seemed to have mostly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and many have shot beyond.

One area that is obviously still struggling are those that require crowded populations to survive, i.e. movie theaters, airlines, cruise lines, etc. 

The market which I feel like will bounce back with a vengeance is travel- namely the airlines and cruise lines. Everyone is tired of stayed cooped up at home, and are likely making revisions to travel plans that they may have had for this year for shortly after the vaccine gets rolled out. 

It just seems like a no brainer to me that these industries will recover to pre-covid levels likely within a year or two, and now seems like a great time to take advantage of that- yet I see nobody discussing it? Am I missing the discussions or do people really think that airlines will die out forever? I just can‚Äôt NOT see them recovering fully soon.

Where do you see oil going in the short term?

A vaccine will be out soon, but COVID cases are increasing. It seems like a shutdown isn't going to happen. But if cases keep increasing, I'm curious if a shutdown would be completely out of the question. Not to mention all the people who will now be working from home from now on, even if another shut down doesn't happen. And in the longer term for oil, clean energy will certainly make oil nearly obsolete. So I've been thinking of putting more money into stocks shorting oil. Take $SCO, for example.

$SCO provides -2x the daily return of an index of futures contracts on light sweet oil. It just dipped below $13.00 while it's all time low was around $11.00. I bought a few shares at $13.16 myself. There are others such as $UVXY which provides 1.5x leveraged exposure to an index compromising first- and second- month VIX futures with a weighted average maturity of 1 month. Also $DDG which provides inverse exposure ti a market-cap-weighted index that tracks the performance of large US oil and gas companies.

Or do you see oil recovering now that a vaccine is coming out?

In that case, would $NRGU be the best choice? $NRGU tracks three times the performance of an equal-weighted index of US Oil & Gas companies. It was also at it's all time low (around $20 near the end of October, before jumping up to $70 near the end of November) but now currently sits at around $50. The switch to clean energy obviously won't happen overnight. So the fact that a vaccine should help reopen our economy relatively soon would certainly help bring oil back up. Especially that the DOW has reached it's all time high, while oil is still very much recovering.

Goldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.

The analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio‚Äôs NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that ‚Äúthe share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.‚Äù

What‚Äôs changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.

The analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio‚Äôs American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.

Nio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, ‚Äúmaking it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,‚Äù the Goldman analysts said.

Existing public charging stalls are often busy, but within ‚Äú10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,‚Äù they said.

Nio‚Äôs ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday‚Äôs prices.

Now I bring to you $BLU. This company is a biopharma development company that lost roughly 80% of it's market cap in July this year. But, the results of that study are disputed in terms of share value. 

Analyst Josh Schimmer and associates believe the market dramatically underestimates the results of a key study.

"The P2 study of ‚Äò5937 missed its primary endpoint, driving shares substantially lower and resulting in a valuation that leaves BLU off most investor radar screens. We believe investors acted in accordance with the negative headline associated with the study results and NOT the underlying data/scientific rationale which is why we are so positive compared to the street."

"But it turns out there was a surprisingly strong (and prespecified) signal within this 'failed' P2 trial ‚Äì patients with more frequent cough at baseline had a clearer sign of benefit with ‚Äò5937."

Evercore has a price target of $12 on BLU to rep more than 400% upside potential. The Evercore PT is almost double the average Wall Street price target as well.

People are lacking patience.

People can do whatever they want, but if we forward to 10 years in time, how many of us can actually provide solid returns with the constant buying and selling that can perform better than the S&P 500, so about 10% annually. It‚Äôs gonna be real hard with timing the market consistantly. Even picking the right growth stock can be really hard eben though Reddit and the amount of speculation does help a bit with it. There isn‚Äôt any guarentees that PLTR can be a blue chip company in 20 years. Sure, there isn‚Äôt anything sure about AAPL or MSFT either, but at least they‚Äôve proven they can do it on a solid basis.

Don‚Äôt want to be mean or anything, just wondering if it‚Äôs really worth trying to time the market if you can get steadier profits from the already existing market leaders. I do enjoy reading newsand staying informed, but IMO it‚Äôd be safer just to stick with the blue chips. The point of investing is gaining wealth steadily, not gambling with it, right? The biggest bonus with growth stocks is probably the possibility of getting huge profits in a short term which isn‚Äôt a reality with the blue chips. You can still get tons of profits with MSFT, JNJ or AAPL, it‚Äôs just that it won‚Äôt happen overnight. I think you should have a healthy mix of both market leaders and growth stocks.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm trying to say with this. Maybe I just wanted to point this out that you shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äùgamble‚Äù everything when investing amid all this speculation and info you get about any stock here.

I apologize for trying to shortcut but I am bit buried in client work atm and want to see what others have as thoughts on CRSR. It recently hit a high of \~$50/share before pulling back to $37.98. From what I can tell based on reports and some slight digging this weekend this appeared to be more about profit-taking than anything fundamental. In fact, CRSR had just adjusted their 2020 guidance above Wall St. estimates.   


I bought into the stock at $18.87 and had originally planned a sell at around $30/share but am still holding with a plan to sell in February after earnings. Does anyone have thoughts on CRSR in, say, a 6-month timeframe. I am surprised with how well the stock has been doing and wanted to see if other people had insights/thoughts on CRSR going forward

Im torn between my options_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 10 Tips for Newbies Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it‚Äôs all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn‚Äôt. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

Tip 1 - You don‚Äôt know shit

You‚Äôre going to lose your money. Don‚Äôt get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it‚Äôs way easier to lose money in the market than to make money.

Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market

Money moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience.

Tip 3 - Play for the long term

The most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy.

Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else

The market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There‚Äôs another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital.

Tip 5 - Paper Trading

Paper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it‚Äôs all practice. No real money exchanges. It‚Äôs a great way to learn, to see how shitty you‚Äôre going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you‚Äôre ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You‚Äôll thank me two years from now.

Tip 6 - Understand taxes

Big difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers.

Tip 7 - No one knows shit

There is no crystal ball, no one has the ‚Äúinside track‚Äù, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It‚Äôs all manipulation. Don‚Äôt even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won‚Äôt get suckered so easily.

Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations

As much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you‚Äôre buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big_dick_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you‚Äôll have more fun.

Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers

Remove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain‚Äôt getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You‚Äôre not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won‚Äôt beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you‚Äôre ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit.

Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication

Like anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It‚Äôs fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit.

--

For those of you this resonates with, you‚Äôll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It‚Äôs a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money.

With the recent Nikola drop and uncertainty, the possibility of chinese stocks getting dilisted and now kandi fraud allegations, it's looking very stressful time for chinese stocks.

I have several deductions I could otherwise apply to my ordinary income to reduce it if I made my normal salary. Medical, property tax, mortgage interest, mortgage refi, student loan interest etc. (I probably have at least $30,000 in deductions).I have shares of stock that can produce both LTCG and STCG. I know the first 40k of ordinary income on LTCG can be tax exempt by falling in the 0% bracket. I would like to be tax efficient and sell and rebuy my shares to reset my potential future tax liability or mitigate future losses by increasing my buy in and resetting my original purchase price without tax consequences.  

If I sell shares in excess net value of $35,000 (potentially $40,000 or $45,000 if I consider the standard deduction and depending on how it is applied-against ordinary income or both OI and capital gains) am I able to use some of the deductions that would otherwise apply to the ordinary income to lower the tax liability on capital gains? Basically can deductions like mortgage interest reduce capital gains tax liability? 

My shares are in Tesla and I would like to either,
1. Sell if it peaks with the S&P inclusion and rebuy of it dips, or
 2. Take advantage of the intraday swings to increase my holding in Tesla overall. 

I don‚Äôt want to leave $30,000 in otherwise tax credits (student loan interest)/deductions (all other deductions)on the table, especially since I‚Äôve been unemployed this year. 

I can‚Äôt find anything on the IRS site or any of the online areas that indicate if deductions can lower the capital gain liability.

Tl;dr: if I don‚Äôt have an income, can regular deductions like mortgage interest be used to offset capital gains taxes? Or do these only offset tax liability on ordinary income?

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company‚Äôs future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it‚Äôs GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it‚Äôs shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it‚Äôs share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock‚Ä¶ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe‚Äôs, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna‚Äôs candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it‚Äôs head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they‚Äôre first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn‚Äôt gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

Have a great and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Razer (1337) is an impressively fast growing gaming and fintech business. An alternative to Corsair (CRSR). This is a company that I am interested in, here is my research but please do your own DD. Let‚Äôs start with the risk factors and then move on to the exciting bits.

Like all companies in this field, components are made in Taiwan and China. However the company is Singaporean company so this may actually be a good thing for their business as the relationship between China and the west becomes more fraught. Razer also heavily relies on the success of the gaming industry, although they are diversifying.

Razer is a founder-led company who are developing a strong ecosystem that combines gaming and fintech with impressively fast growth. They also provide banking services specifically tailored for the youth and millennials worldwide.

Although people are saying that Corsair is going to boom in price, Razer shows more growth potential than Corsair. They have a slightly lower market cap ($3.2B compared to $3.4B) and revenue ($911M and $1.47B) but their revenue is growing significantly faster (32% compared to 14% predicted for 2021). Most importantly, they are quickly becoming a significant player in the fintech arena.

Razer Fintech was founded in 2018, is headquartered in Singapore and Malaysia, and is primely situated to supply many emerging markets. It is a leader in offline to online digital payments, where they pay users directly for geographical information that they subsequently use for advertising. 

Razer Fintech has submitted its application for the Digital Full Bank License to be issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and are considering similar moves in Europe and the US. Razer Fintech will be focusing on the underserved youth and millennials segment for the bid.

Razer Fintech is planning to extend its current fintech offerings to digital banking services by building the world‚Äôs first global youth bank, Razer Youth Bank leveraging on the strength of Razer as a lifestyle brand synonymous with the youth and millennials.

Other key numbers and facts: 

¬∑ Founder holds 35% ownership and there is no evidence of any insider selling in the last 12 months.

¬∑ Cash balance of $586M with zero debt.

¬∑ The market leader in gaming peripherals and premium (>$1800) gaming laptops.

¬∑ Monthly active users of their software up over 45% YoY driven by esports and streaming.

¬∑ Their Razer Gold gaming subscription service has seen an increase of 125% YoY in total payment volume.

¬∑ 114% YoY increase in total payment volume of business-to-business and business-to-consumer digital payments in Southeast Asia.

¬∑ Their operating expenses have fallen consistently over the last 3 years, not just as a percentage of their revenue (which they have, 40% to 24%), but also in absolute numbers ($133M to $115M).

Corsair is up over 150% since it‚Äôs IPO in September but it looks like people still haven‚Äôt noticed Razers potential in gaming, esports, and fintech. Now could be the time to jump in on this stock.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I‚Äôm 24 and currently have about 53k saved up from living at home after i graduated 
I had a golden opportunity in my position where I could‚Äôve invested during the March crash. I think I had just over 30k around that time.
Reasons I didn‚Äôt invest was just a couple weeks before  the crash I got a home loan approval for 30k down payment. 
I also tried my hand at SPY puts and options during the crash and lost just over 1k and I guess I backed off from investing for those two reasons. Didn‚Äôt end up going through with the house 

Yes I know I‚Äôm an idiot going into puts/calls with little experience before I even invested normally. 

I now have 10k in account1 and 10k in company stock in acct2
My portfolio in acct1 has only grown just under 1k. I invested the 10k late august/early September

I guess because I have much more money saved up, do you think there will be another crash similar to March?

I doubt it for 3 reasons. We‚Äôre in the last wave, there‚Äôs a vaccine right around the corner, and the odds of another crash like in March which was compared to the Great Depression seems unlikely

What are your game plans?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I understanding how to play the TESLA S&P news correctly? thank you so tesla is being added to the S&P on 12/21 and the name of the company being taken off will be named on 12/11. I am a newbie and I read the prior post addressing this news but am still unclear about the impact on price and why it will have such impact.

As a newbie, I do not understand what these firms are exactly obligated to do/how much tesla they need to buy once this switch is made on 12/21, but my basic understanding is that these firms will need to buy a lot of tesla shares on 12/21. Having said that, I want to understand the most likely effect this will have on stock prices and how to profit:


1. As background information, will new shares of tesla be issued so that these institutional firms can buy them or will these firms just be buying existing shares on the market the way you and I do? (this is important to know for the next question)

2. Does it mean that the price of tesla will increase from now until 12/21, because people will be buying now knowing that institutions will have to buy a lot of tesla stock starting on 12/21? And that the tesla stock price will probably continue to rise for a few days after 12/21 as these firms continue to buy the shares that they need?

3. So does this basically mean that the company that is named on 12/11 will experience an immediate price drop on that date since the general public will sell it in anticipation of a sell off coming frominstitutional firms of that stock in order to make room to add tesla instead on 12/21 (an early sell off)?

thanks all

**Current Price | Resistance Price | Post Covid Price (1 Dec 2020)**

**$NRGU = $53.45 | $678-402 | $942.96**

^ Potential recovery percentage growth to $942: 1677%

^ Peak 5 Year Price = $1142/Stock

**$GUSH = $34 | $324-835 | $1462**

^ Potential recovery percentage growth to ~$1462: 4200% (No, I‚Äôm not kidding) 

^ Peak 5 Year Price = $26,220/Stock

**$ERX = $13.56 | $73-131 | $179**

^ Potential recovery percentage growth to $179: 1220%

^ Peak 5 Year Price = $445/stock


**Sample Growth Upon Recovery** 

*Not peak price but 1 year highs*

Assume $10,000 invested 

NRGU = x16.77 (1677%) = $167,700

GUSH = x42 (4200%) = $420,000

ERX = x12.22 (1220%) = $122,200








**Key Points:**

* Price is dependent on $XOP and $XLE since they are tracked by these companies. I am focusing on the oil aspect (not raw crude prices) and supply chains. 

* It is very unlikely it will hit 5 year prices. 

* Mixture of Energy ETFs (leveraged). Energy does include oil, I am focusing on oil. 

*  Highest yield growth in terms of recovery stocks/ETFs 

* If you really think oil exploration is going to end during EV, you‚Äôre very wrong. Boomers are just waiting for a recovery and have doubled up on it. 

* One of the underlying stocks is Chevron (NYSE: CVX) Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation

* This includes the aspect of Fractional Distillation which has reduced in demand than normal during covid due to exportation issues. 

* To go deeper, fractional distillation is used for: Bitumen for roads and roofing. | Fuels for ships, factories and central heating. | Lubricating oils, waxes, and polishes. | Diesel fuels (many of the trains around the world still use this). | Jet fuel, paraffin for lighting and heating. (Airlines are starting to pick up in demand and many have started taking in bookings to prepare for flights &amp;amp;gt; more consumption of jet fuels). | Petrol for vehicles (reduction in demand for this due to EVs and hybrids but this is the only aspect). | Chemicals. | Liquefied petroleum gas. 

* Biden supports renewable energy, but he would make sure the old money gets their run, as old money still runs the economy. - Leading to recovery. 

* Roads are still using to use refined crude oil despite the EV market. 

* These companies within these EFTs have invested heavily into solar energy, supporting sustainability, and adapting to changing markets. Which Biden is known for. 

* In terms of Leveraged EFT/Stocks = UCO (leveraged crude oil) used to be the reliable one but they changed their method to investment method because they couldn‚Äôt survive March 2020, so these are the best alternatives.  

* All companies within the EFT are reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

* It‚Äôs 3x leverage, what do you expect, high risk high reward. 

* Recovery Stock


**Risk:**

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays but cannot liquidate such as a leveraged/options contracts

* Gives common stock buyers and holders a high risk opportunity play. 

* TQQQ recovered higher than it did recover and that‚Äôs leveraged Nasdaq, this is due to percentage growth

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays this will include drawdowns. (Highly volatile). 

* High overhead costs but this gets isn‚Äôt a issue due to high cash flow of these companies. 

* If you buy leveraged contracts or options you‚Äôll have deeper profits but hope you have enough collateral to survive the drawdowns. 

* This is high risk and won‚Äôt give you overnight returns but will give a decent gain only IF it works out.

How high do you think it can go before the end of the year? I‚Äôm conservatively assuming this pushes it over $30 by the middle of the month and even higher with a successful launch. 

Please chime in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If stock price is market cap divided by number of open shares, why are some stocks so volatile? General discussion here...

The basics of stock pricing is that it‚Äôs the market cap divided by the number of open shares. So in short, whether a company does amazing or terrible, all that really matters is how many people continue to buy/hold their positions.

Aside from the risk of a company going bankrupt or delisting, why does little news play such a big part in the volatility? Sure they can affect dividends, but most volatile stocks I‚Äôd say people aren‚Äôt really in those for the dividends anyway.

How much further does this go? Some bad press about quarterly earnings come out and a bunch of people sell, but if everyone held them then it wouldn‚Äôt change the price.

So basically, why does performance have so much influence when all that seems to actually matter is the number of available shares?

Looking for discussion

Or am I missing something?
