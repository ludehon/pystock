Tech stocks I’ve decided to get rid of some of my stocks that have recovered well from the crash in March like $KO. I’ve also sold some other positions in some smaller cap oil companies. 
My portfolio does not have any tech stocks and I realize that this is a mistake. 
I’ve done some good research the past few days and I’ve found my 3 candidates:
1. $PYPL
PayPal looks to be a good investment as they keep growing year over year, have an established active user base, and are introducing crypto to the Venmo app (proven to be profitable for SQ, and hoping for that growth to kick in here)
2. $AMD
AMD just came out with some computer chips that should be a better premium product than industry leader Intel. Intel is in a rough patch right now and AMD is making a big push for gaining market share. 
3. $NVDA
Just an absolutely solid company. Still king in the graphics card game, (AMD on their heels though) their balance sheet is very similar to AMD but looks to just be a bit more polished. However I’m worried about if this has opportunity to grow (famous last words). 

Which would you invest in? I have a few thousand in cash right now and I could spread in all 3, or only 2._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unusual buy/sell gap - am I missing something? Took out some stock in Cryoport (CYRX) following today's announcement - this Pfizer vaccine will need to be kept at particularly cold temperatures and they specialise in cold chain logistics. Made some initial gains, but then when I checked my HL account this evening after the markets had closed  I saw a huge drop of 23.75% of the value of my units! I couldn't understand why that was, so I checked the buy and share price, and saw what appears to be a huge discrepancy:

Currently - this lists the buy price at $53.55, but the sell price way down at $39.10 - which is lower than it has been since August - having climbed steadily from $13.56 since March. That means a difference of $14.45 (27%) between the broker's offered buy and sell price which I have never seen anything like before.

I take it that this is just an error which will be corrected in the morning?

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Today's COVID-19 vaccine news is the best and the last positive news for the rest of the year The S&P 500 only went up barely over 1% on such good news today. There is not any good news left for the rest of the years so there's no way but down or side way. There's the stimulus plan but it's not going to happen the way Trump is kicking and screaming now.

* The S&P 500 increased +1.25% today while the NASDaq weakened by (-2.13%). The Russell 2000 outperformed by (+3.57%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+2.92%)
* The best performing sector was Energy(+14.29%) while Communication Services(-0.88%)was the worst performer.
* The energy (+14.2%) and financials (+8.2%) sectors finished comfortably atop the leaderboard, aided by noticeably higher oil prices ($40.31, +3.17, +8.5%) and curve-steepening activity caused by selling in longer-dated Treasuries. The consumer discretionary (-1.6%), information technology (-0.7%), consumer staples (-0.5%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors closed lower. 
* The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.18%, while the 10-yr yield increased 11 basis points to 0.96%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.6% to 92.82. 
* In other important news, Joe Biden was projected the winner of the U.S. presidential election, although President Trump did not concede and said he would file legal challenges. Note, media reports indicated that Mr. Trump would unlikely succeed in overturning the election results. 
* It's worth mentioning that at one point today, the S&P 500 was up as much as 11.5% over the prior six sessions. Presumably, that left it primed for profit taking amid an understanding that the market still has to get through the new wave of coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding another stimulus package.

- We know what to expect and how to handle a second one. People might just continue to practice mask-wearing and social distancing despite rapid rising cases and go about their day  
  
- The recent announcement of Pfizer vaccine success (although the amount of time for continued testing, manufacturing, and distribution would mean quite a while before the general public gets vaccinated)

Hi all, I just recently paid off my student loan, and I have a full time job in my field of study. Now that I am finished paying my loan off, I'd like to start investing some of my money.

I feel like at this point I'm definitely too uneducated/undisciplined to begin day trading but I'd really like to start building my retirement portfolio. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, why should I not just buy a piece of amazon whenever I can afford to? I keep hearing that diversification is the key to a strong portfolio, but if I'm buying amazon, a company that doesn't seem to be going anywhere, is diversification necessary?

Today, I am posting about Palantir. Might be a little late posting about this, I bought in around $10 which is their IPO price. Here's a couple reasons why I believe in the long term success of this company.

* Big name backers like Peter Theil.
* Big data/AI analysis. I don't own any stocks in this industry aside from your typical FAANG stocks. This is an opportunity to consolidate my positions into a more focused strategy. I also get to invest in government and defense stocks at the same time.
* Palantir is not just a government and defense stock. Palantir is already expanding to enterprise applications. I believe that this is where our future in society is moving towards. We have made significant progress in technology in the past 20-50 years. We spent so much time and money developing and rushing out newer technologies and in the mad rush we forgot to optimize. There is so much room to use AI and machine learning to figure out where the inefficiencies lies.
* This kind of proprietary tech has a huge moat. It's not something that any competitor can just come and replicate. Their technology is advanced enough to attract attention from the government and companies like General Motors. Having also worked in the industry, I can tell that their tech is way more advanced than their competitors.

As always, only invest what you can lose and you are ultimately responsible for managing your own risk!

EDIT: This post surprisingly caught wind. I'm glad that some of you share the same views about PLTR as I do, I am also glad some of you are expressing skepticism. I love discussing companies and general stocks.

But all of this is delusional. At least in the short term.

It will take a while before we return to normalcy. For that the vaccine needs to be massively distributed first. Which will take time because, you know, logistics, bureaucracy & stuff. Then stuff like travel & outdoor entertainment will only go back to pre covid level way after the vaccine has been massively distributed.

Does anyone have insight into why this stock fell so much today?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on this? In May 2020, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill (Senate measure S. 945) that, if passed into law, could lead to a delisting of all foreign companies unless they were able to certify that they are not owned by or under the control of a foreign government. These companies will also need to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit their books for a consecutive three-year period for the purpose of verifying such a status.

https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges

The bill is yet to pass through the House and signed into law by the President but could have near-unanimous bipartisan support should it be put to a vote. If it does make a successful passage and is signed into law, it could lead to a mass delisting of securities issued by tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu (BIDU), not to mention the 200+ other Chinese companies that have gone public since Alibaba's IPO in 2014. The only ones that will survive the delistings are the ones that can categorically prove that they are completely independent of government control or ownership, and there's a slim chance that any of them can avoid being delisted. 

On the other side of the line is the opinion that delisting such stocks will backfire and hurt American investors because billions of dollars have already been invested in the stocks of these companies. Wall Street will, of course, lobby lawmakers in an attempt to block the bill from being put to a House vote that may also be near-unanimous in its censure of Chinese companies.

Ultimately, it may come down to the will of the President of the United States, who will be caught between the figurative rock and hard place.

&#x200B;

Many people said the market has already realized this.

&#x200B;

However, news from today morning said that LIbya has just surpasses 1,000,000 BOPD of oil production. Meanwhile, crude oil prices are up 10% today on vaccine news.

&#x200B;

Is this shaping up to be an excellent shorting scenario?

Any help would be appreciated thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ McDonald’s to test McPlant, which includes a meat-free burger, next year; Beyond Meat shares fall McDonald’s will test a meat-free burger in several markets next year as it adds plant-based menu offerings, which it has coined “McPlant.”

International President Ian Borden said that McPlant was created “by McDonald’s and for McDonald’s.” Borden said that the McPlant line could also include chicken substitutes.

The company has not yet disclosed the supplier for the line. A company spokesperson declined to identify their supplier but said that McDonald’s will not be manufacturing the products.

Shares of Beyond Meat, which made the meat-free patties for McDonald’s Canadian test, fell as much as 6% in morning trading on the news. The stock was briefly halted for volatility.

McDonald’s began testing a meatless burger, dubbed the P.L.T., in several dozen Ontario restaurants in September last year. By April, the chain had ended the pilot and has since said that it has no plans to bring back its P.L.T. burger at this time.

Former McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson, who was an early investor in Beyond, sits on the plant-based meat maker’s board. Investors have speculated that the connection between the two companies could mean a long-term partnership and make Beyond a supplier for the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales.

Other international McDonald’s markets have found more success with meatless burgers. Restaurants in Germany, for example, have added veggie burgers made by Nestle to their menus.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors that markets will choose if and when to add McPlant items to their particular country. He added that the exact pace will be dictated by consumer demand.

Rival Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International, released a plant-based Whopper in the U.S., with a patty made by privately held Impossible Foods last year.

Shares of McDonald’s rose less than 1% in morning trading after the company’s third-quarter earnings and revenue topped analyst estimates. The company also released an investor update, predicting systemwide sales growth in the mid-single digits in 2021 and 2022 and sharing more about its strategy for boosting sales.

Beyond is expected to release its third-quarter results after the bell Monday.

One massive green day on good news, followed by another big green day from sheer momentum, then a significant drop as that momentum slows and things correct. Getting some real deja vu. I seem to remember 5 months ago we had this same exact thing happening. A vaccine was announced, we had 2-3 ridiculous green days as everyone got hopeful, then once the momentum ran out everything dropped like a rock. Now assuming this vaccine does work at 90%, it does provide more hope that things will recover, which means the drop shouldn't be as significant. But it will likely still happen to a degree.

My advice? Tomorrow will likely be green. Sell and take your huge profits then, even selling half your position if you're not entirely convinced, then DCA into things over the next 1-2 weeks. If Wednesday is green, and it very well could be, be glad you got two out of three days of the runup.

I have a problem and it's not the usual problem "i don't know what stock to buy"/"i'm stressed about losing money".

In fact, my issue is that i can't think about anything other than stocks. I spend hours everyday reading quarterly reports, 10-Ks, investor presentations, news articles about the companies i'd like to buy. 

When i decide that i like a company, i can't stop watching my broker's account waiting for the price to dip a little so i feel ok at buying it, then if the stock goes up i want to buy more, if it goes down i want to buy even more. 

While i'm working (from home), i always keep my PC on so i can keep an eye on what the market is doing and plannig my next action. If i buy a stock and doing that my cash diminish, i immediatly transfer some money from my bank account so my liquidity is restored and i'm ready to buy again. This is hurting my performance at work and i'm always distracted, i go to sleep always late because i NEED to finish reading that 10-K filing.

I started investing like three years ago in a mutual fund, switched 2 years ago to S&P500 ETF and in september i started investing in individual stocks. 

And the worst thing is that i'm not even so much concerned about getting rich or earning/losing money...i just want to own that company. This morning i bought some shares of a real estate investment company that build-owns-rents corporate buildings mainly in the city i live, and the thing that i'm thinking about is that next time i'll go downtown, i'll look at those shiny skyscrapers and think "i own a part of them".

I hope you are doing great :)

I am writing this post, as I have a question related to the market cap of a company. As you all well know, the market cap is a measure of a company's size and it's calculated by multiplying the shares outstanding by the market price.

However, I have been thinking about the company's operations. Why would a firm find a larger market cap useful? Why does company XYZ care about the trading price of their stock or market cap?

The shares have already been issued, so it is not a matter of financing. Additionally, let's imagine that this company won't engage in any transactions or deals. Hence, it's a public company that only goes along with their operations.

Why would a company want a large market cap?

Any help will be highly valuable, as sometimes I truly think that the stock market is a huge bubble (as a concept) and that few things actually happen in the company's with all the money that is traded daily.

So the stock market and economy seems to love the fact that Biden has won the election and that the Government will likely be split with the Democrats holding the House and the Republicans holding the Senate. The fight for the senate is not over as there will be 2 important elections in early-January to decide this. Even if both the seats are won by the democrats, that would result in a tie which would then be decided by the Vice Kamala Harris but people are not talking about the filibuster problem.

The filibuster is a political procedure where members debate a proposed legislation act to delay it as long as possible and this is sometimes called as „talking a bill to death”

For debates to end there is still a 60% majority vote required for the talks to end,so i believe there is no immiment danger for any tax raises or something landscape shatering to happen.

The only thing that Democrats can do in Senate without this problem is appoint executive branch nominations, federal judicial appoiments and as of 2017 they can also decide on Supreme Court nominations.

What measures are they taking?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NNOX (NanoX Vision) vs $MX1 (Micro-X) Hi, wanted to share something I thought and perhaps get some additional opinion or similar experiences to what I have had.

As a green investor I jumped on the ($NNOX) NanoX Vision hype train, but as time went and I did more research my feelings became more and more mixed.
They seem shady but then you say maybe the foundational South Korean, Israeli thing comes into play and you keep trying to search for all of these companies (that do not have a Google presence) or deals (sometimes they seem to announce partnerships even though it seems just like theyre buying parts or services and want to make it look special). Furthermore the company doesn't seem to try and hire specialists from my research or put any transparency first or foremost compared to any other ones I own.

I try and do constant DD updates on the stocks I own and found an article on SeekingAlpha about NNOX and competitors like MX1. I had no idea what the company was before that. After I started researching it seems to have no market love (first stock for me in Australia market, maybe they could do an US listing?) but I am much more happy with it than I was with NNOX tbh (minus the market hype).

This company has rough financials, very poor marketing ( according to LinkedIn/last investor call they hired a marketing person 4 months ago, but tbh based on her exp she's over her head - but god bless her if she can pull it through). No youtube, no social media presence apart from LinkedIn. The CEO is a bit of an older guy and not from US so to me it seems more like a traditional company that he was making. But it seems they finally grasp that this year and try to do something about it.

The most hilarious thing for me is that they actually already have & ship similar products like Nanox says will have later. But while Micro-X is 90M Market cap, Nanox is 1.52B as of the time of writing! I actually wrote to the company and a few people to perhaps help them out and shine some light on them. But maybe I am getting too excited again?

So whats good on Micro-X?
-The company recently replied and informed me that the marketing push is on a fast track and a priority for them.
-1st question in latest investor call was also about Youtube, social exposure.
-https://micro-x.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Micro-X-Annual-Report-2020.pdf Products already shipping and more to be released with contracts being signed
- Check page 9 on that PDF. Reminds you of something? (there is also more photos on the actual prototype somewhere in the page, perhaps the presentation tab, cant recall)

I want to give the company fair exposure and thought writing here would help because there is almost nothing. 
Disclosure: I sold half of my NNOX and bought MX1, both are still only 5 percent of portfolio, NNOX at peak was over 20 percent. I am hoping this thread accidentally doesnt give it too much exposure so I can buy more :).

Hopefully this helps you. Please tell me maybe somebody did the same? I wanted to let my whole NNOX position go, but still wondering if it has a future or I am being unfair or if I should trust my gut feeling. Though their presentation is not too far away.

Cheers.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Netflix bets big on Asia as it sees ‘significant potential’ in these markets When the tech company reported third-quarter earnings last month, it said nearly half of its paid membership growth came from APAC — the greatest share of any region. International expansion has been a major focus for Netflix in recent years, particularly in markets across Asia-Pacific since 2016.

The company has pushed mobile-only plans in places like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, offering those subscription plans at below $5 a month. That’s a stark contrast with the kind of premium pricing Netflix has in markets like the United States, where a standard subscription costs about $14.

In India, for example, users can pay 199 Indian rupees ($2.68) a month to watch Netflix uninterrupted in standard definition on a smartphone or tablet at any one time. The mobile plan, introduced in 2019, was in addition to three other plans that already existed, ranging from between 499 rupees a month to 799 rupees.

Bullish on markets like India

Zameczkowski said Netflix is “very bullish” about the kind of opportunity Asia presents. “Markets like Japan, (South) Korea, India, Indonesia are definitely markets where we see significant potential and we will continue to invest in those markets,” he added.

India, for example, has the second highest number of internet users behind China, with around 570 million internet subscribers and growing at a rate of 13% annually, according to EY.

Netflix for its part has spent $400 million in developing original content as well as licensing other content for the Indian market between 2019 and 2020. It has developed more than 40 pieces of original content in India, including the Hindi-language drama “Sacred Games” featuring high-profile Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

Rest of Asia

While Netflix isn’t available in China, the company has invested significantly to develop local content for the region. It has produced more than 200 original titles, including over 70 Korean live action and anime titles. The company has also invested more than $700 million in financing partnerships and co-productions in South Korea since 2015 and the country has 3.3 million paid subscribers as of Sept. 30.

A commonly cited industry study from Google, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company predicted that Southeast Asia’s internet economy will grow to $300 billion by 2025. Video streaming and music subscription services are said to be popular among younger users, the report said.

“If you look at APAC, we are still at the beginning of our journey and we still believe that there is a huge ... opportunity there,” Zameczkowski said.

Still, total global paid net subscriber additions for the third quarter were only 2.2 million, which fell short of analysts’ expectations.

I built (80%) a tool for stock portfolio optimization in Python.  
I'm looking for advice as to what additional analyses or functions / features I should add.

The objective is to automate the steps of my decision making on my annual audit of my Vanguard stock portfolio.

Simply put, the program:

* Allows the user to select stocks to analyze (using Tickers inserted into an excel) , and select the time period.
* Grabs historical data.
* Provides the user with a risk / return plot for all of the selected stocks
   * I use this to select stocks that have high return and low volatility
* Provides the user with a dendrogram to help optimize diversification by reducing intercorrelation.
   * I tend to select one stock from each dendrogram 'leaf' that also has a high return/volatility ratio.
* Provides the user with the ability to then select a smaller subset of the stock list for further analysis
* Runs simulations of volatility/ returns at different weights for those stocks that are chosen for further analysis.
* Reports the portfolio with max sharp and max returns among the lot.
* Allows the user to interact with the simulation plot and select scenarios.

&#x200B;

My questions:

* How do you quantitatively go about portfolio optimization
* Is what I am doing a good way to go about it.
* Is there any interest in me publishing this to reddit once finished?
* What tools / plots / analyses would you recommend?

For instance, the definition:

1) My net worth, or my joint net worth with my spouse, exceeds $1 million, exclusive of the value of my primary residence.

2) My individual income exceeded $200,000 in each of the past two years and I expect the same this year.

3) The joint income of my spouse and me exceeded $300,000 in each of the past two years and I expect the same this year.

So I have been trading option calls and sometimes puts for a couple years now but I haven’t ventured into the different types of spreads and combination/strategies but I have been trying to start to learn a little more now after reading about Call Debit Spreads and how they can (from what I understand) offset some of the cost with higher priced options while also minimizing the time decay.


If I’m understanding the strategy correct I would:
- Buy an ABC call option. (same expirations)
- Sell an ABC call option at a higher strike price. 


My question is, since the only reason I am able to sell the ABC call without actually owning 100 shares, is because I have the option but this is the part I’m not familiar with and would really appreciate some help...I’ve never sold calls or puts but could the person I sold them to exercise/sell them at any point (just like I would be able to do with any call I purchase) and if so would that automatically force the call I own to be sold as well?


TL;DR 
If I enter into a call debit spread what happens if the person that I sold the call to exercise/sell it whenever they want? And how does that effect me? Would my call also automatically me sold?  


Hopefully this makes sense, any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
