I am sure there are people around there who are also worried about the delisting news in next 3 years. If any of these companies get delisted, we still own the shares in that company except (as per my understanding) it will be transferred to other exchanges where we might need to bear some losses.

However, I just got an idea (and please feel free to correct me or put your suggestion):

**NIO, BABA and several other Chinese giants are also listed in Frankfurt stock exchange as well**.

If there are people like me who believe in the potential of these companies (like NIO, BABA, Li, XPeng) AND are also worried about it getting delisted - why don't we get shares at discounted prices from the Frankfurt exchange, rather than getting from NYSE? There are a number of apps/interfaces available to buy from there.

This way we are:

1. Minimizing the losses
2. Getting away from the worries of delisting crap
3. Getting stocks at the discounted price

According to analysis by S3 Partners, short investors in Tesla— those who placed bets in the market that its shares would lose value — have lost $35 billion on those positions so far this year.

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year. 

Dusaniwsky said many of the shorts have closed out their positions — the number of Tesla shares held by short sellers is down 63% so far this year. But he said many are still unwilling to change their minds, despite the losses.

A lot of people freak out when the market is at all time highs, and think to themselves it’s time to move to cash because all time highs means a bear run is coming.

Since 1950 to now, roughly 1 out of every 15 days the market was open, it has closed at a new high level (roughly 6.7% of all trading days).

The S&P 500 has spent roughly 32% of its life within 5% of its (up to then) all time high and 24% of its life within 2% of its (up to then) all time high.

Of course this doesn’t mean we can be rest assured that there’s not a bear market on the horizon, but we also can’t be sure of how soon that’ll be or how far away it will be.

If I own a stock of actual company and the company reports profit/loss etc, the price fluctuates accordingly. Although a stock price is supposed to reflect the value of the company, it seems with growth stocks, the price also reflects how much the investors want to bet on the growth. So, a stock like shopify is rising so high with little correlation to the actual earnings/net assets of the company. Please correct me if I am wrong.

But, for an ETF, it actually has underlying holdings. So, does it mean the proce changes daily on how the underlying stock prices change? Or, does it change based on how much investors are betting on the ETF? I mean if an ETF becomes too popular, similar to a stock, is the price going to increase steeply because the investors are betting on the growth of the underlying holdings, thereby deviating from the actual value/profits of the underlying holdings?

# BULL CASE

I know what you're thinking, Turtle Beach faces massive competition with the likes of Corsair, Logitech,  Sony, Microsoft etc. However, in the Gaming Headset market Turtle Beach currently holds about 43% market share, and is responsible for 7 of the top 10 selling Xbox One headsets, and 5 of the top 10 PS4 Headsets. Not only do they already have a large portion of the Gaming Headset market, but Turtle Beach is also experiencing massive growth in sales for Non-Gaming purposes, such as work from home. However, all of this information is still excluding the recent acquisition of ROCCAT, a company that sells PC gaming equipment such as headphones, gaming mice, etc. This is a completely untapped market for Turtle Beach, and is expected to provide massive growth in the coming years. I haven't even begun to mention the coming Stealth 700 headphones, designed for the next-gen consoles that came out this year. 

# VALUATION

Now the argument against future growth is certainly one to be considered, but something that can not be argued is the insanely low valuation on this company. It currently trades at a $305M market cap, despite already having $329M in Revenue TTM. The company is expected to do about $338M in Revenue before the year ends, and I expect them to beat on this metric considering pent up demand in consumers for the Holiday season. In comparison to competitors, their 8.19 P/E ration is about half of the sector's average P/E. 

Also, considering that 80% of their revenue comes from brick and mortar stores (GME, WAL, and TGT being their top 3), it is amazing that they were able to crush this years revenue during multiple lockdowns in many states. To top this all off, the company is sitting on $27M in cash, compared to $5.45M in debt. 

# RISK/REWARD

Now, some of my concerns with this company include huge competition from the names mentioned above. However, my largest concern is the fact that it's 5 largest brick and mortar stores supply about 62% of revenue. This means that if a company like Gamestop were to go under, it could have a large affect on sales.

 To me, this risk is offset by the fact that the company is already undervalued at its current price, without factoring in the likelihood of continued revenue growth from its PC Gaming ventures and Console Headsets. If $HEAR were to trade at even a quarter of what a company like CRSR does, this should be worth at least a $50 a share. 

TLDR: Turtle Beach ($HEAR) is a highly undervalued company, and has a massive opportunity for continued growth in years to come for a possible 2-3X in stock price.

So I was learning and trading over the course of last year and made profits swing trading.

I went all in on $55 calls for 24th December and it was looking good for the first few days (I purchased them when price was around $52 and that time it didn't seem like it was impossible to increase by $3 seeing the growth YTD)

So I quit my old job at Zumiez (ZUMZ) back in January of this year. I enrolled in the Employee Stock Purchasing Program (ESPP) back around 2016 and invested very little as a way to "get into stock" or try and get myself to learn more about investments in general. We got a relatively good discount on stock, so I thought why not. Well, a few years later and I now have 32 shares of stock in the company valued at about $36 per share. When I started to buy them, they were only about $15 each.

In the last month, it gained almost $200. Total, the market value i'm sitting at about $1100. It also says something about the disposition type being "Disqualifying until 02-Apr-2021" which I have 0 clue what that means, even when I tried researching.

Should I hold onto them or cash them out? Also, since I am no longer an employee do you think they will take the stock from me or is this mine forever? I'm just worried cause of the state of the world, and all I hear about is how high the stock market currently is.

I really don't need the money at the moment, and if I was to cash it out I'd just put it into my savings anyway. I'm asking here because when I did call before, it was hard to get through and the person wasn't very helpful.

FSLY peaked at $130+ back in October, but the news of TikTok stopped using FSLY service, has caused a panic selling, which resulted in almost 50% drop from it's ATH. Now the stock has slowly gained momentum.

Now that Cisco is trying to buy FSLY, which would be interesting because Cisco has been falling behind throughout the years, compared to the meteoric rise of FSLY.

As a FSLY long, I am not sure if selling is a good idea, since FSLY by itself is way more promising than joining Cisco to me.

Spirit Airlines, with their attractive ticket fairs, may very well reach pre-Covid prices by Spring. It’s no secret that airlines, cruise, and hospitality took the biggest hits during the initial sell offs in March and April. And it is no mystery why they are the slowest to recover, as they cannot supplement income through any digital methods as many of the other sectors such as retail, and tech obviously can.

However, whether their books reflect it or not, the expectation will be that in this coming year, with the implementation of multiple vaccines across the globe, that there will be a boom in these neglected industries. Again, as a fundamentalist myself, I am not claiming that they will regain 2019 level profits, though that is quite possible, I am simply stating that Smart money, and institutional investors have been piling in for two months now, with the expectation I assume that the vaccines will begin to revive these industries, and any stimulus they need will be granted.

I’ve been dollar cost averaging into Spirit Airlines for a little less than two months, expecting this gap to be filled, and as of the past few days, it has held strong, with all indicators pointing to a continued climb, with likely short term consolidation. before regaining momentum.

I will be continuing to dollar cost average into spirit airlines as I feel it still offers the best value among airlines.

In a time of such political and financial uncertainty, it's hard not to try to win the prediction game on ACB in hopes of progressive legal maneuvers such as the legalization of marijuana.

**HOWEVER: The stock may not be as viable as it is attractive.**

**It's at a tipping point**

ACB is sitting at nearly $12 a share, almost 40% higher than it was just this time last week.

**Canada vs US**

Unlike the US, Canada (where ACB is based) is actually becoming stricter in their jurisdiction regarding the recreational use of cannabis. Because of this, it might be safer to invest in a company based in a European country, like the netherlands

**History Repeats Itself**

Aurora Cannabis stock price peaked in January of 2018 at $130 per share. Now, in December of 2020, the stock is priced at less than a tenth of the price two years ago. Imagine the investors that had to deal with the fallout of the plummeting stock and how easy it is to lose everything you might have. Does that seem financially responsible.

**Overconfidence**

After a couple of US states decided to decriminalize the possession and recreational use of marijuana, the ACB stock soared as people instantly placed their trust in the company. In reality, this stepping stone on the path to ACBs success is small when compared with the boulders that still remain in their way.

**The skinny (tl;dr):**

People overinvested in Aurora Cannabis following the ruling of the decriminalization of marijuana in several US states, and the stock is artificially inflated because of this. When a comprehensive look is taken at ACB, what some people seem to find as a way to make a quick buck might turn out to be a dangerous fantasy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could You Theoretically Become The Owner of Tesla?

I think it's something I'll be doing at year-end on an annual basis moving forward as well as exit comments on all positions. I am open to risk and my portfolio reflects that. Thoughts and criticisms appreciated!

**Investment Theses - Dec 1, 2020**

**ARKK ETF**: Technology is expanding and compounding at a rate that is hard to keep up with. The same can be said of many of the primary holdings of ARKK. These are companies that have benefited the most from how quickly the world is changing today as well as how the stock market landscape in general is changing.

**CLOU ETF**: Cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant as businesses are relying more and more on big data to optimize their businesses. While this sector has received a bump from the COVID-19 pandemic and may level off for a time, I see it as a catalyst to a sector that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

**QQQ ETF**: The Nasdaq has exploded over the past decade, far outpacing the S&P 500. This is the technology age, and those changes are just starting.

**TAN ETF**: As we push into the 2020s, solar energy (and other forms of clean energy) is something that is finally starting to be looked at seriously. With the massive amounts of infrastructure to be laid and work to be done, this industry won't be slowing down anytime soon.

**AMZN**: I mean, it's Amazon.

**BAC**: Huge financial institution with a long history that will be propped up by any means possible. Bank of America and other financial institutions were hit particularly hard by the drop in early 2020 and should have some further upside. This is more of a short-term idea as investors seem to be somewhat rotating back into value plays.

**DIS**: Disney is currently at a crossroads - they have the opportunity to break into the streaming revolution that is taking over the world, and they seem to be doing far better than anyone thought they would be. With a huge amount of IP, Disney has the capacity to rise to the level of Netflix (while not being a direct competitor) at a much quicker rate. Add into the mix their parks and retail side, and we should have great growth and a stable rebound moving into 2021 and beyond.

**T**: AT&T has obviously bungled their way through the DIRECTV acquisition while taking on a lot of debt to acquire it along with Time Warner. On the plus side, they've been able to effectively manage and bring their debt down due to continually strong cash flows. It remains to be seen whether they can shake off the nightmare that has been DIRECTV and capitalize on the shift to 5G as well as HBO Max.

**V**: Credit and debit cards are far from ubiquitous in the US and even more so in other areas of the world. Visa remains the company to beat in the space.

**CRSP**: The secret to the future of medicine lies in CRISPR (gene editing) technology. If this technology can be harnessed in the way it is imagined, the potentials are without end. The technology is still in the nascent stages and will undoubtedly face many delays and challenges along the way. This combined with the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics is not guaranteed to come out on top in the sector (although they are well-positioned) makes this is still a speculative but somewhat safe play.

**DKNG**: Betting on outcomes in life is something that the average person does every day. Throw sports, money, and easy accessibility into the mix, and you have a perfect storm. DraftKings already has a strong presence in their fantasy lineup pools. Now states are dominoing to legalize online sports betting as not doing so will lose them out on a lot of taxes as people cross state lines to place their bets. 2021 will see an explosion in the sector.

**FUBO**: A synergistic investment with DKNG, fuboTV is the ultimate streaming platform for all things sports. They've spent the past several years building up quite the library and consumers have no problem shelling out $60 a month in order to access it. As ESPN bleeds under DIS, consumers will flock to the streaming service that provides all of their sports needs: fuboTV. One of their most interesting ideas is how to work live sports streaming in conjunction with sports gambling.

**LULU**: The king of athleisure, Lululemon is here to stay, and it's safe to say that lines that come out of Lululemon stores even during the pandemic show just that. Sound financials throughout 2020 and seem to be poised to come out of the pandemic in a better position than they were in before. It will be interesting to see how they leverage their acquisition of Mirror.

**U**: You can mine for gold or you can sell pickaxes. While gaming might not quite be a gold rush industry, it has shown a lot of solid and steady growth over the past decade, and we are starting to move into the next generation of gaming. This growth will continue as more and more of Gen Z get older. Unity is well-positioned but will need to see if they can capitalize in the upcoming years.

**VRYYF**: A very small Canadian plant-based meat company that had its IPO in mid 2020. The products are great and in line with the growing population of vegetarians and vegans. Their demand is currently too high, and they cannot ship product in a timely fashion to consumers. They've acquired several new plant locations that could show huge expansion in their production as well as the US market. It remains to be seen whether that spike in production will be met with the same level of demand, which is what the current astronomical valuation is based on.

Some.background: I am a software engineer. I don't work at Palantir. This is all based on my own prior knowledge and things I have read in one of their user guides. My positions- PLTR shares and Jan. 2023 calls.

Here it goes.

Pretend I'm the NSA. I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.

Palantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.

1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the "universe" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.

2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.

The end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I understanding averaging down? So I know averaging down can't magically reduce your losses, but am I correct in thinking it does make it easier for you to recover/profit when/if the stock goes up again? Tried googling it and it's always recommended to buy dips if you think it'll go up again but I want to make sure this is why.

For example, if you bought 5 shares at $100, you paid $500 and your average cost is $100. If the stock tanks to $80, you've lost $100. If it recovers to $100, you break even. If it hits $110, you make a $50 profit.

If you buy 5 more shares when it's 80, you've now paid $900 total for 10 shares, you've still lost $100 at the current price, but your average cost is now $90.

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.

The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.

Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. 

The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.

While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.

Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million

Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.

Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.

This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA

[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.

While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.

A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. 

While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. 

Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.

And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave & Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

They sell equipment with royalty contracts for cannabis, food, pharma sectors. They have been working on drying and dehydration technology for about a decade now. They did really well with the cannabis rush but their stock took a big hit with the sector’s crash. This last quarter they’ve been showing some really promising signs. Their tech has a very wide application from weed to snacks/backed good and with potential for vaccines. 

* In the last couple months they have had a surge in equipment purchases and associated royalty contracts in a range of industries. With these recent royalty purchases they’re lining themselves up for a strong future cash flow.
* They’ve had new purchases of 70kW and 100kW machines – a big jump in their previous equipment lineup.
* Cannabis seems to be on a comeback with the market more consolidated. They recently received Health Canada approval for cannabis research license and continue to sell to cannabis companies in the US.
* Drying drugs and vaccines is a promising sector with a lot of money being poured into it right now.
* On top of that the company announced they are buying back outstanding shares over the coming year, which should drive the price up.

When I started screening stocks in the past and also while keeping track of them right now, I had the weird feeling that most real growth stocks had their explosive gains when they were priced at a fairly "smaller" amount (around pennystock to \~$25 range) than the ones priced in the 3-4 digit range. 

As an example: Stock 1 is priced at $5 and Stock 2 is priced at $500. My mind keeps telling me that it's way easier/normal/more likely for Stock 1 to grow 400% to $25 than for Stock 2 to grow 400% to $2500. Which is basically stupid, because they both had the same growth.

On the other hand it just feels to me that there are almost no higher priced fast growing stocks than alot of cheaper priced stocks that are growing rapidly. And this just feels a little bit weird to me, because there are also not that many stock splits happening for those higher priced stocks..

If you think about it, most of the higher priced stocks already had their huge gains in the past (because most of them didn't have an IPO that high and also started as pennystock or in the 1-2 digit range) and they turn into a more "established" stage. Like how could you expect them to grow another 400% in the future??

In conclusion, how could one buy a stock priced $500 (started at $50) with the hope for it to be a growth stock (which is funny, because it already was one) instead of buying a stock priced $10 which didn't have such rally yet and is expected to grow in the future. So, what's the reason, alot of people still  buy a highpriced, already well-established and kinda saturated stock, that had it's huge gains in the past, expecting them to have such high gains again?

I'm a game player myself. Overall I love this company and their games. 

I noticed that ARK funds recently started to buy Nintendo shares and then spent some time tonight on the company and read their 10-k: [https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/annual2003e.pdf](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/annual2003e.pdf)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** is that Nintendo is doing a great job since the release of switch in 2017. Their revenue spikes even more during covid. I think the key to the stock is that if they can keep releasing high quality exclusive games in the near future. As a game player, I'm optimistic on this. Based on this assumption & their financials, I think the company is undervalued. 

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

I'm trying to dump all my thoughts below and would love feedbacks. It can be a bit messy as I wrote this on my bed before sleep :) Skip if you don't want to read.

**My Story:**

* The most important product of Nintendo is of course Switch. Here are some points I noticed around myself:
   * LOTS of my friends who never play console games before(those who don't own PS4/Xbox) bought the switch these two years, especially during covid to play animal crossing
   * Almost all my friends who own either a PS4/xbox will also buy an additional switch
   * My gf never played any video games in her life before. But when we bought the switch & Zelda, she spent tons of time & $$ to Nintendo. (She still doesn't like my PS4 till today)
   * Lots of old games are in resale on switch. These are really easy money for switch. People who don't own other consoles will likely buy these games on switch.
   * At least the games to be released on the platform next year looks good.

&#x200B;

**Fundamental:**

* Nintendo has a P/E ratio of 47  with a \~10% yoy revenue growth (after releasing switch in 2017). This may look a little bit pricy but they actually made a \~50% yoy quarterly revenue growth. Partly related to the covid & Animal Crossing release. Comparing Q3 VS Q2 VS Q1, there is also \~15% revenue growth. 
* Their major revenue is from game sales on switch. As time grows, the newly released games would have a larger potential market. In their 10-k, the sales from switch platform grew \~18% yoy (2020 v.s. 2019).
* They have \~14B cash & marketable securities with only \~3B total debt. This is quite healthy.
   * I also noticed they have <1B shares outstanding. So their cash alone contributes to >$10 to their share price
* Their profit margin is \~25%. The expenses are quite consistent along these years (\~0.8B spent on r&d). So the margin may actually be higher if their revenue continues to grow.

&#x200B;

**Valuation:**

I usually do a quick DCF calculation but use the number only as a reference. I'm giving \~$79 to the stock, assuming a conservative 10% growth rate & steady 25% margin & 0 risk. If I give them a higher growth rate, the price could be $90+.

So to me apparently the market sees a higher risk in Nintendo.

&#x200B;

**Comes the Risks:** The two major risks I have in mind are:

1. Other form of entertainments, especially mobile games;
2. If Nintendo can keep releasing unique exclusive games
   1. This might be the larger risk. If we see a WII U 2 in the future, then the stock will crash.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

This is not going to be your usual NIO post.

Since the delisting news, we all know that it has been quite a ride and by now everyone knows it so we are not going to reiterate that.

With this post, I would like to highly appreciate and applaud those NIO holders who are still holding AND who still believe in this company; which is growing in worlds largest EV manufacturer market and sitting on one of the largest Lithium reserves.

YOU GUYS ARE UNDOUDTEDLY FEARLESS! Hats-off to you and you have my respect for still keep believing this company.

On Tuesday morning NIO reported that it [delivered 5,291 vehicles to customers in November](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nio-scrambles-to-boost-production-after-sales-doub/), more than double its [year-ago total](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/09/nio-november-2019-sales.aspx), on strong demand for all three of its upscale electric SUV models. Demand is so strong, the company said, that it's pulling forward a plan to boost its monthly production output to 7,500 vehicles, hoping to hit that pace by the end of December.

Hence, take a deep breath and HOLD HOLD HOLD!! and if possible, buy the dip! It is a long-haul stock and still got 3 years time. Recall the greed/fear quotation from Mr Buffett._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seriously Thinking of Selling GOLD & TSCO . . . ? I bought GOLD at 30 in mid-Sept, and TSCO at 150 in mid-Oct. Both have turned out to be dogs, and I'm seriously thinking of selling them. But GOLD just bounced off support at 22.25, so I'm probably going to wait to see if it hits resistance at 25.50 then sell. Still, I might even hang on after that because if/when Congress produces another COVID-relief package in the trillions, wouldn't that be bullish for both GOLD and gold?

As for TSCO, the company seems to be doing great but the stock is not following suit. It's possible that it might be consolidating in preparation for an imminent turn upwards (see daily chart for 10/22 thru present), and it seems to have found support at-or-about 130. But does anyone think it's going to go lower? If so, why? Or, do you think it's going to start climbing again, perhaps to 150 and beyond?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy SalesForce ($CRM) on the dip?

I actually do like their acquisition of Slack. Wall street seems to think they overpaid and has punished them, down more than 10% on the news and 20% in the last 2 weeks, despite a very strong quarter. Overall their growth is incredibly strong, their margins are 80%, and although $200B valuation seems insane, if they continue their current growth and build out their CRM, and businesses like Tableau and Slack, they could more than justify it and catch up to the rest of the cloud kings.

However, with these new bespoke entrenches, what’s to say the same thing couldn’t happen again? Especially with the pandemic that’s been going on, yet houses are selling in record times. Just curious there honestly might not be anything behind this but curious_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Jumia: This Nigerian prince has grown up, but has not changed We have shorted Jumia several times with a perfect track record. This week we opened a new short position, which we believe will be more profitable that all our previous trades. The best way we can describe Jumia is an investment vehicle to swindle investors out of their money. Jumia at its core remains the same company that IPOed in 2019. Then there was a lot of concern about honesty of the management team--that concern remains. Investors who understand the proverb, “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me”, would avoid investing in this highflying Nigerian company.

Jumia’s stock is running high due to an increase in demand that has already fizzled out. The company has no path to profitability. The demand for Jumia’s goods in the second and third quarter was not organic; it was mostly driven by store closures, supply problems, and an imitation of Western countries. Our research shows that Coronavirus fears in Africa were prevalent from mid-February to mid-August. After that period, people mostly stopped caring about Covid-19 and returned to their normal shopping habits. Jumia experienced an increase in demand from mid-April to mid-August. Hence, it was able to capitalize on Covid-19 fear by reducing advertisement expenses by 55%. The lag in start of expected increase in demand was mostly due to poor experience of ordering goods from Jumia. High rates of cancellations, failed deliveries and returns were a testament to that fact. High advertising budget is an essential and necessary part of Jumia’s business model. The profits Jumia can derive from each customer was and will never be more than the cost of customer acquisition.

Revenue in the third quarter dropped despite onboarding more customers. During the golden time of e-commerce, total revenue dropped from $40.9 to $33.7 million. First party revenue (i.e. revenue from merchandise bought and sold by Jumia) dropped by 53% year on year in the third quarter. This pattern is in line with continuous reduction in in FPR reported in the previous quarters.

Jumia management executed a perfect share offering worth $243.2 million at an average price of $30.51. We see that as the management’s agreement with our thesis that shares prices are significantly inflated. We were able to initiate our short position at a slightly higher price.

Two catalysts will burst this bubble: The next earnings report showing significant underperformance during the holiday season. We believe Jumia’s 2020 black-Friday and cyber-Monday sales were significantly lower than those of 2019. The second catalyst will be American investors rotating out of Covid-related stocks when a vaccine is approved in the United States.

To address a recent endorsement presentation by Citron Research about Jumia: we were able to read between the lines and decipher motivation of presenter. Hence, we are thankful to Citron Research making opening price of our short more attractive.

In short, Jumia is our best short idea._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to reconcile your option trades to see how much your making?

> Lion isn’t selling passenger cars. They are carving out a different niche in electric vehicles making school busses and commercial trucks. Lion’s school busses take on traditional school bus makers such as Blue Bird (BLBD). Lion’s trucks take on models from companies such as Paccar (PCAR) and Navistar International (NAV). Many of Lion’s trucks are targeted at applications such as waste hauling and utilities.

> Most of the traditional products Lion competes with are powered by diesel fuel. But electric vehicles make a lot of sense in commercial, fleet applications. Those vehicles, for starters, are driven more than passenger cars so the benefits from cheaper electricity for charging versus diesel accumulate faster.

Also:

> Lion has had early traction selling its products and says the company has firm orders in place for several hundred trucks and buses in 2021, and sees up to 6,000 orders from its current pipeline. Customers tend to purchase a handful of vehicles at first, test them out in working conditions, then scale up their orders based on that experience.

An old acquaintance of mine told me that she had received an email from a company asking if she would be interested in "lending" her shares to shorts?  In return, this company (it is not a brokerage) would pay her an "interest" every day the shares are loaned out to / through them. 

Per the email, the shares cannot be on margin or the value of the shares  MUST exceed her margin account by a certain percentage. This doesn't apply to her as she owns all her stocks outright and has never traded margin. She could sell her shares at any time (at which point the payments would cease) but she is not allowed to vote on proxy when the shares are loaned out (maybe because two people cannot own the same shares)? 

Frankly, what am I missing here? 

If two people cannot own the same shares then how are two different people allowed to simultaneously hold them? 

Also, why on Earth would an investor "loan" out shares to shorts, even if she were paid to do so,  knowing that it would drive the value of her investments down?

I've currently got Tesla and NIO stocks but thats it. I've heard Costco is good to get for dividends. Any others that are good or possibly.. not as known but will be good in the future?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AT&T becoming a growth stock? Seems to good what am I missing...
