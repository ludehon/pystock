As more new investors enter the pool, each brings with it their group of special websites that they turn to for sound advice moving toward a purchase. Some stocks have had their price value adjusted up or down by larger organizations that predict pricing. Further, some older companies with long track records remain hard to research. Where are your go -to -picks for finding honest financial assessments  or other important information like revenue, production estimates, or collaborations coming?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Joe Biden's administration could end up developing major passenger rail infrastructure. Which companies should we anticipate to benefit from such policy? I've recently been interested in passenger rail potentially becoming a much bigger industry in the coming decades, as North American governments and municipalities are starting to wake up to it's potential. In the wake of Biden's presidential win, and a possible Senate majority on the horizon, it is looking like we should be seriously be considering the possibility of the United States rolling out a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure plan. For reference, skim Biden's page: [https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) and note how the team explicitly states their intentions to develop municipal transit and light rail networks, while also **Sparking the second great railroad revolution.** Even the Biden campaign site had little train graphics on it at one point. I should also point out that Biden is famous for his dedication to the Amtrak system as a passenger and also a key advocate for it's upkeep, for this he has been nicknamed Amtrak Joe.

I think it is safe to assume that Joe Biden and his administration have real intentions to invest heavily in rail transport as part of their green infrastructure plan. Therefore, I think it would be wise to start breaking down the industry and looking into which companies are poised to get involved and benefit from this "revolution".

But I have a few questions:

Since I have virtually no experience researching this field, where should I be looking? I know that a lot of equipment is made by overseas companies, but also a significant amount is manufactured in America.

Has anyone else been looking into this for some long term plays?

I haven't been able to find many people discussing passenger rail in general. Perhaps it is because most major passenger rail operations in the states are government corporations, or because the industry is mainly fed by very large, diversified companies. So my question is, are there even companies that are heavily weighted/invested in specifically passenger and light rail development? Should I be looking at European,and Asian markets instead of North America?

Anyways, it interests me as I am keen on developing a greener portfolio. It would be cool if I could get away from airlines and invest in rail.

I really want to get Tesla as i keep seeing that EVERYONE on here has it. Is it a safe bet to buy and hold now or should i wait?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market = One Big House Party! I have come to the conclusion that choosing stocks is like throwing a house party! Here's  my explanation.

So many crowds to consider for this party!

  You've got your popular, wild and unpredictable crowd who are the life of the party, but sometimes breaks stuff or throws up on your couch. (TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc..).
 
  You've got your cool, fun loving crowd that keeps 
you on your toes (FAANG, etc...). 
 
  Then theres your every day, average joe crowd that nobody has beef with but aren't overly excited to have there either (JNJ, MMM, LMT, etc...). 
  
  Finally there are the wallflowers, nerds and weirdos. This crowd is either ostracized, ignored or simply hated (GIS, MO, T, HSY, CPB, etc...). Some of them just don't make themselves noticed, some of them aren't trendy enough to hang with and seem out of touch with the theme of the party. Others are simply hated and are picked on and pushed around.

The point of all of this is to ask yourself one question.

You are the owner of the house, it's your party. Who's getting invited and why?

 Do you want to have an extravagant party with the most wild, popular crowd you can imagine, knowing that it could get broken up at any moment (TSLA PE 1000+ lol). Or is a more chilled out party with no chance of noise complaints, drama or puke more your thing?

Neither is wrong in my humble opinion, both have their time and place, as well as healthy amounts at every party. I want my party to be fun (ETSY, SQ) but I don't want to risk burning my house down in the process. I want a mix of everyone at my party. I dont want everyone there to be a bunch of wall flowers sitting around not doing anything most of the time (GIS, MO, HSY, etc...). Always good to have some old faithful friends there too who can still have fun (WMT, JNJ, MCD, AAPL, etc...).

My understanding is that apple will have a predictable single digit growth over the next couple of years. Maybe that will be boosted or maintained by their own silicon project, who knows. It might in the future do better, but it doesn't seem like that have many new markets to grow into.

Let's say I don't contribute any more to traditional and I manage to grow the 8000 to 50000 by retirement. Am I taxed capital gains tax on the gains (44000 in this example)?

The San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of “3-D digital worlds” that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends. Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to “normal.”

Roblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.

Roblox expects to trade under the ticker “RBLX” on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .

Here are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.

1. If you don’t have tweens, you’ve probably never heard of it

If you haven’t heard of Roblox, you probably haven’t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.

Since most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million “assets” in the first nine months, and has “had a human respond” to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.

“We ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,” the company said in its SEC filing. “An early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.”

2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic

When the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.

“We have experienced rapid growth … given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,” the company said.

In the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.

Similarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.

3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple

Roblox makes money by using a virtual currency called “Robux” that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.

Back in August, the popular videogame “Fortnite,” made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple’s AAPL App Store and Alphabet’s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.

Roblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That’s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.

The company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as “sales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.”

Booking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.

In a nod to COVID-19’s part in the surge, the company said: “We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.”

4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened

While Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.

Roblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.

The biggest culprits in 2020’s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.

“Developer exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,” the company said in its filing.

Those fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.

In the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited “an increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.”

5. Early investors get a big upper hand

The IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.

Those Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.

Later investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.

Tiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.

Earlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn’t even break into the list of “greater than 5%” stockholders.

Everyone has been focused on what will happen to TSLA when it gets added to the S&P 500, but I'm actually wondering about the opposite. What will happen to the index's value when Tesla gets added? The S&P 500 currently has a market capitalization of approximately $30 trillion USD. Now that Tesla has a market capitalization of over 500 billion, that represents approximately 1.5% or 2% of the S&P 500's total value. When Tesla is added in December, does that mean that the S&P 500 will immediately jump up by 1.5% on that day??

Edit: I think I found the answer. Looks like when a stock is added or removed from the index, that the index divisor is changed to adjust the value of the index to remain unchanged on that day (at least from factors related to the addition/removal of a particular stock):

When I first opened my Fidelity Roth IRA I purchased zero-fee ETFs instead of SPY. Eventually, I realized I wanted to buy into SPY for the dividends so it could compound over time.

Given that the market is at all-time highs, I am looking to sell all my FXAIX and FZROX (both Fidelity 0% fee S&P tracking ETFs which DONT give out dividends) to accumulate all that combined money and then immediately throw it into SPY so I can obtain more yearly dividends and let that compound. Is this a good idea or bad?

A few of my worries:

Will I get capital gain taxes on my FXAIX and FZROX gains?

Are dividends automatically reinvested in a Roth IRA into my SPY holdings?

Can I get dividends in a Roth IRA?

To me this seems to be a bit safer than how ARK tends to weight their biggest holdings around 10%...

In this article I will explain why this is a good investment through my own eyes. All the information I express is what I was able to gather from Airbnb’s submission to the SEC. The truth is I was waiting for this IPO for a long time, and it is surely the most important IPO of 2020. The IPO is going to take place in December without a clear date being published and will be listed as (NASDAQ:ABNB). I will be covering the following matters:
• Company’s Overview
• The impact of the coronavirus – Financials
• Competitors – WHAT DISTINGUISH Airbnb from them
• Risk factors to consider
• Safeguards to consider
Company’s overview
Airbnb is a vacation rental online business, that allows people worldwide to find places to stay either for travelling purposes, or business purposes. It is used for short-term stays meaning a temporary accommodation. It was founded in 2008 and has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, United States. It has more than 7 million homes listed, and it operates in 100,000 cities. Does Airbnb own the properties listed? No, it doesn’t own any of them, in fact people like you and me that have a residential home can list it on Airbnb after successfully complying with its rules. This helps the homeowners to achieve higher occupancy rates since it gives them “automatic advertising” when they appear on the searches without them having to spend money on advertising. Of course, Airbnb doesn’t do that for free! It charges them a 14 - 16% whereas in some other cases 20% to those who offer experiences and this fee is deducted from the hosts payout. This fee can vary from country to country. 
Impressive how such a “simple” idea – two friends renting their house to help them pay their rent, twelve years later turned into a business worth $18 billion. Before the coronavirus pandemic Airbnb was worth $38 billion.
Coronavirus pandemic impact on Airbnb - Financials
I believe that from now on the Covid-19 impact on any business is very important to be mention for a thoroughly comparison of what it used to be and what may be again. According to Airbnb’s reports, in 2019 there was an increase of 32% $4.8 billion in its revenue and a 29% increase in the bookings to $29.4 billion. However, 2020 didn’t seem to be a good year considering the virus, revenues faced a decline of 32% to $2.5 billion and its bookings fell by 39% to $18 billion.
Needless to say, that the net losses from 2018 to 2019 have seen a huge rise from $17 million in 2018 to $674 million by the end of 2019. Pandemic widened these losses even more for 2020 accumulating at $697 million losses until September 2020. The total deficit was $2.1 billion as of September 30,2020.
These numbers are surely causing you to reconsider your investment in Airbnb so to spread your hopes up again Reuters estimates a valuation raise to $30 billion. Not to forget that Airbnb was valued $31 million in 2017 which is nothing to what it is valued now after the pandemic. In general, This IPO hopes to reverse this decline.
Competitors
Since Airbnb falls under the booking market, I need to highlight the many rivals it has since this is a small barrier business to entry.
1.Unlike Airbnb, Expedia group (EXPE) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) have both reported a steady earning report that shows operating profits increasing year by year.
2.HomeAway (AWAY) does not charge a fee for each booking like Airbnb does, and its only asking for an annually $350 to advertise the property. Meaning leaving the hosts with much more profits than Airbnb.
3. Trip Advisor (TRIP) which is a rival, reported a much smaller revenue compared to Airbnb accumulating $156 million in 2019.

What distinguish it from its competitors?
The company’s advantage over its competitors is surely visible for the following reasons:
1. Airbnb is 3 times bigger than Trip Advisor
Trip Advisor might be a competitor, but Airbnb has an advantage over it if you compare the sizes which means Airbnb does not have to worry about it, at least for now.
2. Airbnb has a rapid growth
Comparing the percentage changes, Airbnb has proved to be growing almost 10 times faster than Booking Holdings and 5 times fast than Expedia Group.
3. Airbnb is very liquid
The term liquidity means that a company holds available funds in the bank. According to Bloomberg it holds $2 billion cash in the bank which means it can help it overcome the losses and the negative events that bother their way.

Risk factors to consider:
Before the vaccine I would have definitely say third wave of Coronavirus, but after the vaccine news I am personally very positive that all this will be a history soon, but this is a different article.
1. The regulations for short-term rentals are becoming stricter.
Airbnb grew because of the non-existing regulations of short-term rentals, but after this rapidly growing business things became more apparent. There have been some incidences from hosts discriminating guests, blaming guests for damages, misleading them from the pictures, even some parties going on causing police engagement. But like Uber, Airbnb it’s just a technology platform connecting hosts with guests. Bottom line, it can be very difficult to come up with regulations in all cities and regions which give Airbnb space to breath.
2. The competition becomes bigger.
Other online booking services like, Booking Holdings (BNKG) that provides the same service. In addition, Expedia (EXPE) bought Home Away (AWAY) few years ago and raised competition. Likewise, a French hospitality Accor bought short-term rental One Fine Stay and Marriot International (MAR) partnered with home rental platform Hostmaker to provide short-term rentals. As it seems Airbnb changed the game for hotels and pushed them to pursue other strategies which points how strong of a player is.
3. Airbnb does not have a clear path of profitability.
In fact, Airbnb has not ever generated profit, and this is something big to consider. All this together seem to shadow Airbnb’s future. But, with the IPO going on, and the available cash in the bank there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.
Safeguards to consider:
1. The hotel sector has proved to be far more “destroyed” from Covid-19 than Airbnb which keeps it in a strong IPO position. Did you know that as of December 31, 2019 72% of 327 million Airbnb nights were booked by individual hosts? In other words, 92 million nights were listed under professional hosts by Airbnb. Moreover, Marriot International had 1.38 million rooms meaning almost 67 nights of full occupancy. Would these guests stayed there and keep Marriott’s properties full if it wasn’t for Airbnb? I don’t think so.
2. Recently, Bill Gates expressed his opinion on how the business travel will drop 50%. This can be very bad for hotels, but what about Airbnb? Because of the way everyone travels today, using online bookings and seeking to pay less for the maximum luxury, it makes it harder for hotels to beat the industry and especially Airbnb.
My Opinion
Investors need to consider all possible factors to form their decision. There is not a final price for the stock going IPO. At the end of the day is all a belief and since people will “value” it on the market I believe they will give it quite a high value at least in the long term. It is on my personal portfolio list, since the world is on track for a coronavirus free world.

With Christmas coming up I’m expecting plenty of sales of Microsoft’s new gaming console, the Xbox Series X and was wondering how this could effect earnings and the stock price during and after the holiday season.

1) Game consoles initially actually sell for a loss for the company, with money being made up in the following months/years

2) It’s hard to judge the effect on stock price based on the 2013 release of the Xbox One as gaming is even bigger now than it was 7 years ago

3) Microsoft is likely to see steady growth anyway, so it’s hard to attribute anything to just one of their products

This is one of the things about Square that I use on a weekly basis. Since you can deposit cash into a Square account, you can request a Square card (flimsy plastic but you can customize the design). I actually used the laughing emoji's and $$$s alternating and they approved it. It's not a credit card, just acts like a debit tied to your cash app account.

BUT, you can add boost's onto the card daily, and every week they add a "10% off at grocery stores". Literally, every Tuesday for me. This is up to $75 dollar's worth, so essentially you can get $7.50 (less deducted) from your cash app. This is WAY better than rotating 5% grocery stores or the 3-4% that has been promoed by AMEX/Chase Sapphire. I think perks like this is another reason why SQ is a very aggressive and forward looking company.

Edit: Other boosts I have gotten: $10 off $20 anywhere, 10% off taco bell, door dash, USPS, nike, etc. They used to have a $1 off coffee shop assuming 1.50 spend, so a 3.00 large iced coffee cost me 2.00, AND at coffee shops that served alcohol, I would also get a dollar off (used every 2 hours), but sadly it has went away :(_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QuantumScape (QS) is it a buy?

Originally posted on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)

&#x200B;

* **Q: I don’t want to read. Can you summarize what you wrote below in one sentence?**

Monday will be the last day of $ZI’s lockup period, meaning that from next  Tuesday on, 320 million of the locked shares will be allowed to be sold  to the public.

&#x200B;

* **Q: What is $ZI?**

**$ZI (Zoominfo) has nothing to do with $ZM (Zoom)**. **It has nothing to do with video conferencing or WFH**.  Zoominfo provides client relationship management solutions. For  example, it helps salespeople to find new leads and helps marketing  people to better target customers. Its business is similar to  Salesforce, albeit much smaller and with a narrower focus.

&#x200B;

* **Q: How many shares are currently outstanding?**

69 million

&#x200B;

* **Q: How many more shares will be unlocked?**

320 million, or **4.6 times current outstanding shares**

&#x200B;

* **Q: How many shares on average are traded each day?**

30 day average volume is about 1.7 million. So **the unlocked shares are 188 times average trading volume**. Or in other words, **even if only 0.5% of these unlocked shares are sold, that is already more than entire day’s trading volume.**

&#x200B;

* **Q: Do you have any proof?**

[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/) Page 220.

&#x200B;

* **Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the share price is still low?**

$ZI’s IPO price is 21$, it is right now trading 51$, **or 245% of its IPO price**. Plus, **its IPO was priced above the range**. Almost every tech IPO was priced above the range this year due to the tech fever.

It has outperformed competitor $HUBS by 9% this week alone, for... no  reason at all. **It is even up by 9+% today because people are not aware  of the coming lockup expiry.** Thanks for the great short opportunity  though.

Let’s say you are an early investor or employee of $ZI. You made your investment or received stock  option pre-ipo. The share price you paid pre-ipo must be significantly  lower than IPO price 21$. Now, the share has gained 145% from even the  IPO price, meaning **it probably gained 300%, 400% from the price you paid. Would you choose to at least take some profits?**

Remember, **even  if only 0.5% of these people choose to take profit, the selling  pressure will already be higher than a whole day’s trading volume**

&#x200B;

* **Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the fundamentals are undervalued?**

Price to sales ratio is 32.5, which is 3 times Salesforce’s P/S 10 and twice Hubspot’s P/S 17. I won’t say it is undervalued.

More importantly, hey, wake up, this year is 2020. Nobody cares about valuation anymore. When people buy, price goes up. **When people sell, price goes down.**

&#x200B;

* **Q: How much can a stock fall when a big selling pressure is expected?**

I will give you an opposite example. How much can a stock rise when a big buying pressure is expected?

$TSLA

S&P  500 inclusion will create a $51 billion dollar, or roughly let’s say  100 million shares $TSLA buying pressure. $TSLA trades more this week,  but its average daily volume is about 40 million shares. So the buying  pressure expected is about 2.5x daily volume. This inclusion will happen  on Dec. 18, so still more than 2 weeks away. Even tho it’s still 2  weeks away, $TSLA has already risen 45% since the S&P news.

Now you can build your own expectation on how much $ZI can fall.

&#x200B;

* **Q: If I want to sell the shares now, is it already too late?**

It has been up 45% this month. No significant retracement has happened yet. **Few people are even aware that this company exists, let alone its lockup is ending next Monday.** So here I am writing to tell you that. If people knew about this, it would have shitted its bed already.

&#x200B;

* **Q: But 2 weeks ago, Morgan Stanley upgraded their price target?**

Nothing  unexpected here. Morgan Stanley is the lead underwriter of $ZI. I am  yet to see any lead underwriter downgrades stocks it underwrote before  lockup expires. **These bankers**, who are going to make tens of millions of dollars this year even when the poor are losing jobs, **know how to keep their customers’ happy.**

The stock has risen 25% after the upgrade. Even without a lockup expiry, a correction may still be expected. It’s no $TSLA, **it does not have a meme status. A regular stock is unlikely to go one way up without hiccups.**

Other  banks' like Barclays 12-month price target is even lower than current  trading price, and that is without considering the lockup release  impact.

If you trust Morgan  Stanley’s price target simply because you trust the bank’s name, it  would be logical to go YOLO on $MS and hold it forever. Why don’t you do  that?

&#x200B;

* **Q: So TLDR, should I sell the shares?**

You are not 5 years old. Make your decision. If you think the unlocking  of 320 million shares will create a selling pressure, sell it. If you  think every single stock in the world should be worth 420.69$ as our  living Jesus Elon has hinted, then buy it.

&#x200B;

Edit: It seems it's required to post my position. I am short.

The rally that we have seen this week has been impressive.  I imagine for traders this was an incredible week and a lot of money was made.  Hats off to you guys and cheers.  I've learned that there are many ways to win on the market, and trading is certainly one of them.  I'm not one to say that it's a horrible way to approach the markets just because it doesn't work or sit well with me.  That said, for those who are interested in TRADING, this post may not apply as much to you.

However, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions

1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?
2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals?
3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?
4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?

At least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.

At the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  If your decision to invest is completely based on speculation, then acknowledge that and make sure even that is part of your plan.  I generally encourage every investor to leave some room for spec. plays, but only to the extent that every dollar you invest is all accounted for.  Remember the fundamental fact that by buying a company's stocks you are buying into that company.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.

Best of luck and may we all come out as winners in one way or another._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blan stock portfolio with decent gains I am considering moving from etfs to individual stocks. I’m generally breaking the plan up into two sections. What would potentially be wrong with my thinking?

2. the second part of my plan is to invest in those tech companies that include the the Faang and also emerging companies in ev, cloud, etc.

“Stocks only go up is the refrain” that i assume was a reference to “house prices always go up” from 2008；but I never hear the clue that it’s ironic

The contrarian aaii sentiment indicator (survey of one of the biggest and long running active investors news letter subscribers) is a standard deviation more bullish (48%) than average(38%). Historically this is an indication that we may run out of new bag holders (“money in the sideline”), a sign of limited upside and elevated downside risk

Similar with the fear and greed indicator at 91/100. There can still be short term holiday melt up, but a near term peak coming if not already here.

Markets go up by “climbing a wall of fear” as those fears work their way out of the market where they peak. Most of those fears have been worked out. 

Now the should be catalysts we’ve been steamrolling will be “black swans”

The most likely short term one will be a rush for the gates as the trump tax cuts on capital gains expires

In the short to medium term, a hostile do nothing Congress 

In the mid term, people going back to work and doing productive things will reduce the demand for stock market gambling and bring back competition from small businesses that steal customers and talent

In the mid to long term, populist ambivalence toward policy aimed at stock market performance and the inequality it produces 

There may be a holiday stock meltup. But after this, expect much more risk to the downside.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Let me start this off by saying I am just an engineer not a finance guy and my only reason to invest in stocks is to secure my future not looking to be a quick millionaire which is why I am posting this question here since the folks here are better at doing all the financial analysis required. 

That being said. Apple recently introduced their M1 chip on their laptops which is based on the ARM architecture, previously they used intel's chips which used x86 architecture. As someone who personally worked with both architecture back in college, i definitely preferred the ARM architecture over x86. All of the bench marks performed on the new Apple chips seem to blow every other laptop out of the water which I believe will be noticed by all the laptop makers. I think more and more laptop makers will start introducing chips based on ARM architecture into their laptops to compete with what Apple is offering, I am sure samsung probably has something in the works. 

So my question is has anyone here ever done any analysis on ARM chips and would they be able to comment on which company most of these laptops would be turning to to buy these ARM based chips? I think ARM was just bought by NVIDIA or may be are in the process of buying?

This ETF might not be the best choice for everyone since there are a lot of other great options out there.

My concern is that QCLN has already exploded this year with a massive YTD return, thanks to gains in TSLA and NIO, which are large holdings in the fund. Does it make sense to buy now? I have no positions in these EV companies yet but think they'll continue to do well along with all of the sector. I understand timing the market generally doesn't work and believe in this sector doing well, but can't help but feel as if this is FOMO on my part.

Thanks and happy turkey day to my friends south of the border._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Please help!! For the first time ever i have a little bit of money to invest its only 200 dollars but im looking to turn it into more either long term or short. Ive been reading about some stocks and bond and doing my best how to learn to invest smartly. What is my best option to invest my money or where do i even start. Ive been living pack check to pay check for years and im looking to move towrds finanical independence. Yet dont really know where to start or whats my best investment option?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Nextera Energy a good investment long term? NEE has continued to produce good yields but I’m still unsure if it’s a good investment long term. Are there any other good renewable energy investments that would be good in 15 or 20 years? I’m still a beginner so thank you all very much_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
