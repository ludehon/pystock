Update:  

I held all my weed call options after open, at 10am they were up $25,000 and it would have been an amazing profit. As you probably know, weed stocks kept going up and then shit themselves as soon as rioters stormed the senate.  Prior to this, /u/Unlikely-Trust1128 convinced me to sell off some of my gains for profits, so I sold 50 of my APHA 4/16 10c.  Thank you sir!!!

  

[10am weed stock diamond hands](https://preview.redd.it/xn9dyk2k9s961.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e14730ea2d0554505b591503b5e24ad89e309c)

I was tuning in live to YouTube "Meet Kevin" (Highly recommend) watching the presidential certification, which was cut off because protesters broke past the barriers. Things continued to escalate and at this point I felt a little uneasy. TLRY was still rocketing to the moon, so I decided to sell 20 TLRY 1/15 9c and 20 APHA 1/8 7.5c at the EXACT top.  I also bought 100 UVXY 1/8 10.5c

  

[Weed stock top \(just about\)](https://preview.redd.it/mbrnob8q9s961.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a5979ab1c1eab28da2a56aba1b5f7deadff40c)

  

I paper handed the 100 UVXY for -$500, because nothing happened for like 5 minutes after I bought them, then UVXY shot up about 1 minute later. So what does your typical WSB autist do? I rebought 100 UVXY and sold those about 10 minutes later for a +$1,500 profit, so that trade somehow worked out lmao.

  

During this volatility, weed stocks absolutely shit themselves as America caught on fire. I watched 1/3 of my profits for the day vanish before my eyes in a single hour. After contemplating over and over again whether I should sell the remaining calls, I decided to just say fuck it and hold onto them. TLRY dropped so much, so fast, that I decided fuck it and bought back into my positions (slightly different) at a discount.

&#x200B;

[Weed stock first bottom](https://preview.redd.it/avoxv1ahas961.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=4365870a6bb41cd89de5b94e18cff82baf49b376)

&#x200B;

My reasoning for buying back in is that this is (hopefully) just going to be short term panic selling. IMO, weed stocks still look strong AF.  I have a lot of calls expiring Friday, so I'm hoping that this all blows over and gets sorted out TONIGHT. Dems are still going to win so I think this amount of sell of really was a huge overreaction, but I could be 100% wrong.... who knows. Below is a visual of my moves today (ON TLRY graph) as well as the new positions I am holding overnight. Thanks for the support everyone, here's to another night of no sleep!

Personally, I could see this dropping to 500 by EoD. Regardless I think this could be a good buying opportunity. I'm probably going to wait until the last second to take a position if I do.

**This ETF offers great exposure to:**

**The world's leading semiconductor manufacturer - TSMC (TSM)**
Wanna know who manufactures Apple's new killer chips? What about AMD's product line? NVDA's? Yup that's fucking right TSMC. Much cheaper options, with extremely low IV.

Risks? 
Gina - Currently distracted whipping it's domestic billionaire class into line. Taiwan political leadership wildly popular after successful covid response, not afraid to clap back at Gina's rhetoric.
Liquidity - This is a new ETF with only recently made available options - gotta drip in and out of positions, stay close to ATM to really minimize risk.

Buy into The Hamptons when it was still a bunch of fucking potatoes farms.  $JOE is a company that owns large coastal Florida real estate. The market is on fire and benefitting hugely from the mass exodus of the rich from tax heavy states such as New York as well as the fear of inflation. \[[https://www.joe.com/video-gallery](https://www.joe.com/video-gallery)\] 

 $JOE owns about 170000 acres across Florida. The Company develops its land through segments comprising residential, resorts and leasing.  Fair value today is north of $100 and it likely trades for a few hundred a share over the next year.

It's latest SEC filing makes me extremely bullish. \[[https://ir.joe.com/node/18531/html](https://ir.joe.com/node/18531/html)\] 

It currently has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 40%. Total revenue increased by approximately 28% to $42.0 million for the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $32.8 million for the third quarter of 2019.

This included a 37% increase in real estate revenue, a 22% increase in leasing revenue and a **21% increase in hospitality revenue.** A 21% increase in hospitality revenue, during COVID, not bad...

It trades at 4x book value. Even if the company stops making money and sells all it's land the shareholder will still get more back than what the stock currently trades at. 

Management has also been slowly buying back shares and this looks set to continue, in addition they've announced a new quarterly dividend program this year.

They are set to announce the sell out of one of their developments in the next few weeks and this will likely provide a catalyst. 

This stock will explode over the coming months. If you bought into the Hamptons 50+ years ago your family would have made an absolute fortune. Now is another opportunity.

I have reduced by BFT position slightly to buy some of the Theil SPAC.

I have rolled my PRPL short puts from January 30's to February 35's. I still believe the next leg up will put us in the high 30's or even the low 40's. I expect some type of press release soon as the company has been silent for a long time.

PSTH- anticipated announcement in Q1, hopefully January. The six month mark is Jan 22nd.

BFT- Expecting a merger date announcement soon. CNBC's Grasso is back from having the corona and he is pumping it again. That along with a few big twitter guys will keep this on a lot of peoples radar. Paysafe is a solid play IMO, even if it doesnt shoot to 30 post merger. I am optimistic that we see 17/18 per merger and 25 post merger. This is purely a guess.

All my other positions are small. I've posted them all above. And no, I don't own GME- it might be the play of the century but I think I missed the big run.

No EV SPAC has gone bad this far and this is way better than Fisker which means this won't be the first one that crashes and burns. They produce EV tucks and buses AND school buses. The market is $110 billion per year and the company is currently valued around $2 billion. This means they have plenty room to grow.

Compared to Nikola these guys actually have trucks already being delivered. They have currently sold 300 units and Amazon is testing their trucks and if they like them it will be a rocket like you've never seen before.

They are aiming for 6x revenue growth in 2021 and over 18000 units sold in 2024. Now you're thinking these are empty promises but let's say they're not that empty. Even if we half these numbers it's not a bad buy.

Also, they make their trucks from the ground up which makes them able to grow infinitely. They are the only ones that might compete with the Tesla semi.

They currently go under northern genesis acquisition co or NGA.

TLDR; EV trucks could compete with Tesla (i know it's amazing). Small company = more pump, buy it and fly it... to the moon.

watched it reverse split do its thing and tank.

ultimately was still able to sell for 5% return after a few months. Had I held longer, would've been 10%.

Ended up increasing my position by an extra 50 contracts, I'm now naked 250 x 16$puts for June expiry.

Shares are holding steady at 17 as investors are betting that they will have to increase their bid above 16.50 to take this baby private.

Puts are still changing hands at about .85-.90$, there's still some room to the play, although it's not as appealing as it was on Monday, I think you still have some room to make some easy money while you wait to see what the next meme stock is.

If you have limited margin available, you can open a credit spread selling the June 16$ puts and buying the 10, 11 or 12$ puts to reduce your margin requirement significantly.

The buyout offer is 50c above the strike, this has a VERY high likelihood of success.

However, this vaccine rollout is going a lot slower than expected, and unfortunately there was a new strain of covid found. 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-vaccine-south-africa-variant-1.5860585

The vaccine supposedly will not work for this new strain, which i assume will shorten public desire for the Moderna or Pfizer Vaccines. 

This also means that, we could be on the verge of another pandemic, and dare i say it, another recession, It‚Äôll start with banning air travel to slow the spread and restrictions will get worse from there.

Valuation Disparity...

U currently 800M in revenue.
SKLZ currently 250M in revenue.

250/800 = .31 or 31%

So SKLZ should be valued at 31% of U's current market cap based on total revenue.

U current market cap 45B

45(.31) = gives us SKLZ market cap with U's valuation... 14.06B

SKLZ current market cap... only 7B @ $20

14/7 = 2

We need to multiply the current share price by 2 to get to a 14B market cap.

2($20) = $40

So if SKLZ is just valued like it's peers, it's ALREADY a $40 stock WITHOUT the 100%+ growth they will experience over the next 24 months.

$80+ in 2022.

It's just math.

SKLZ is a BIG FAT gift here.

&#x200B;

Personally, although i wrote my DD over a week ago and had decent positions, i mainly went in yesterday after close (at $19.70) and today morning (at $20.35) for another 600 shares. And I don't really regret any of this. It has been on a steady climb for a couple of days now. Last week the shorts pushed it down, probably trying to shake off more people and spread fear so they could buy in at a lower point. (worked vs. me, i got scared of the idiot crayon TA analysts that said it could go to 15, so i didnt buy the dip and waited for confirmation of runup.)

But last earnings it was the same, it wasn't too late by any means to get in right before earnings. 

From Sep. 21 to Sep. 30, the price went from \~$12.2 to \~$14.5, or a nearly 20% increase. Then it popped to \~$20.5 after earnings, or another \~30%. 2 weeks later it was at \~$25, or another 25%.

So, despite it running up 17% before earnings now, last time it gained another +50% on top of that after earnings. And, as the DD shows, this earnings should be even better. The thing is, shorts and investors seem to know this. The float and volume on this is way too high for retail to move it like this, it's not a meme stock anyway. So you still have today to get into this if you believe in the earnings.

On top of that, the CEO Mark tritton is no imbecile. They have literally hundrets of millions ($325m) to spend on share buybacks until the end of february. **What better point to create shareholder value than to present excellent earnings AND use a ton of the sharebuyback money to blow up the price at the same time?** This duality ensures that shorts start to sweat and the price goes up even more, and for good reason.

Compare this to JWN. They TRIPLED their share price in november due to better than expected earnings, and investors being optimistic about them surviving the pandemic.

The reason for 70% shorts for BBBY is that everyone expected them to not survive corona, or atleast heavily succumb under their garbage assets and dept. All of that has been taken care of. If BBBY shows again that they are on a sustainable road to profits again, this will fly. On this note, I won't sell for a couple weeks even if earnings do pop it 20%+, will wait for 50% at the least depending on earnings. Could be well another JWN in the makings.

&#x200B;

Risks: Earnings miss. This is all, but based on the price movement, DD done and history, this should not happen.

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr:** Share buybacks combined with good earnings and super high short% of float = payday for anyone who still gets in.

If you‚Äôre interested in the company, [u/Nosefuroughtto](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nosefuroughtto/) provided an incredible overview of the different aspects of the business and Raven‚Äôs finances that I recommend you check out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ka1w6j/ravn_cathie_and_arkqs_next_baby/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Since posting, the stock price peaked at around a 24% higher than the lows of December 8th and closed last trading day at $33, an 18% increase from the date of posting. GANG. This leaves us with an additional upside of 50% to return to the previous highs of $49 from August 2018.¬†

As of now, we are consolidating around the $33 level. Solid support at $32.28, and I would buy at these levels, setting a stop loss/alert at just under. Premarket action as of this morning, January 6th, is indicating a breakout above the wedge today. Looking to see a close of a 4hr candle above the wedge to panic buy continue to hold until at least my 35 strikes are ITM.

Unfortunately, the industry is massively diluted. While it will certainly rise as a whole, one weed stock will eat the rest, take all the profits, and send many competitors bankrupt.

When this news comes in, the stock will continue to shoot higher. **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Not to mention, it's a goddamn American company. Right now, all the hot weed stocks are Canadian (because they legalized first). Really think it's gonna stay that way once American companies are given free reign? The stock is also highly rated with good fundamentals, and is rated as a buy across the board.

Fujitsu is already using ERP Suite internally to integrate its ERP systems with other critical systems of record. This new module distribution channel will be accompanied by a Foundry certification program for Fujitsu‚Äôs DX services business.

Fujitsu‚Äôs distribution of Foundry modules will build on the company‚Äôs existing support of customers in their digital transformation journeys, as well as its experience working with large commercial institutions and all branches of the Japanese government.

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

NightMan_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone else on $WBA with me? I'm ready for tendies üöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I‚Äôm beginning to feel like a Streetard _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | BABA | GM & Other Stock Market News [01-06] **What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities & Real Estate just finished in the red.

Most small & mid-cap value & core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil& Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.

The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.

We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index & supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.

If the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it‚Äôs very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big & important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn‚Äôt do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any ‚Äúbig tax changes‚Äù or any other ‚Äúbig regulation changes‚Äù. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn‚Äôt bet against the bull market that we are in right now.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay & WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don‚Äôt think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.

Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN‚Äôs [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.

Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more & more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development & future outlook for the company before. I think both GM & Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling & portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forget the SEC, I took the GME cause to the media Based on u/Isthiswittyenough92's [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr98ym/gme_gang_we_need_to_complain_about_naked_short/), I just delivered a similar message via Tor/SecureDrop to several news agencies' tip line: The New York Times, WSJ, Financial Times, Reuters, Forbes, Bloomberg, and...BuzzFeed.

I made it clear in the message that the SEC adopted the rules on naked short selling after the GFC of 2008, hopefully to get some journalist wet with click-baity anticipation, drawing a direct line of Wall Street incompetence from then to now. I'll either edit this post or create a new one if I get any replies back (depends on the reply). Will it makes a difference? I dunno, but I had to try.

If we see any of these news sites posting something about this...you're welcome.

Edit 1: no one has replied to my hot tips on illegal activity yet :/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FLGT DD üöÄüöÄ First time writing DD, absolute beginner and small portfolio.

1.Macro:

you guys probably have a better understanding of macro than I do.

Georgia senate, inauguration, COVID mutations. But liquidity and Fed brrrt.

2. Sector view:

It's healthcare sector, diagnostics & research industry. COVID is bad in California, 0 icu beds available bad. Even with the vaccine, testing has to be ramped up especially in an open economy.

As economies open, we need more at-home tests, if universities and businesses were to open, for example, they need to be able to do frequent testing and at-home testkits could be done weekly.

Left all but clinched the senate, putting them in control of all chambers of government, obviously being favorable for cannabis legalization.

So, of course, TLRY is fawking mewning 19% pre-market, and it's only like 5 AM

Is it too late to pick up calls at the open?

I remember getting screwed by buying TLRY shares at the open after biden's election win, and yes I bought the top and sold the bottom so I am not trying to make this a reoccuring thing you know?

So.... what's the deal, is the TLRY trade too late? I know theres tons of bagholders out there, but anyone FOMOing on calls that have not already?

I guess what I am trying to say, now that the dems have clear path to legislation, and with federal cannabis legalization being a hot ticket item on the list , it looks like there will be sustained bull pressure on cannabis for the near term

I mean at this point, the next two years are extremely bullish for cannabis legislation, I am just not sure on TLRY as a company, I feel like the sentiment is that its a dog shit company, but does it even matter if there is a narrative such as the one that has developed over night?

TL;DR, are you thinking about buying TLRY calls at the open? if not, why? if so shares or options?

Lion is a super legit company. Confirmed!!!
So much potential, read up on it here. This was before amazon ordered 2000 vehicles!
https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf (notice how JT even visited?)

So basically NGA is a SPAC for Lion to get funding for operations. Theyre saying the merger is happening as soon as feb. The only issue here is that once they merge, Lion shareholders will own 70% of the combined company (IF they end up merging which is statistically improbable but COULD always happen if it gets rejected). SPACs are usually a nono but this ones got a lot going for it.

What this means post-merger : assuming todays after hours close at 23$ per share, this implies a 4.5 Billion dollar valuation. Which isn't much in the EV sector... that's why its a BUY NOW until merger ASSUMING you believe in the EV sector. If you don't, ignore this post. 

When I say "not much for the EV sector" I'm referencing my opinion to NKLA, which isn't even a real company and has 0 product which is valued at 6+ billion usd right now...

What's happening : not many shares are available pre-merger and I doubt the insiders who own 70% of the "unavailable shares" will sell a big part once they can due to the potential of this. It's getting a lot of hype. Possible investigation into this but everything gets investigated these days while no fraud is found.

Above you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.

GameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:

*"Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. "The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."*

How much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.

50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft

Let's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.

This works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate [from Sony Quarterly earnings.](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q2_supplement.pdf)

\-Moving average and candlestick analysis-

7/16/2012, Nokia bottoms out at $1.63.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q7xnyyeswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7bcbb0221d8c69d85d364c77a930b7af0bd9d3

9/15/2014, a bullish correction/impulse tops out at $8.73.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1brpg9xswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97f7ac1c12b6a6d0f89b3b64c7088ccdb42b7a7

&#x200B;

10/14/2013, Nokia broke above the red 200 MA, and on 8/24/2015 had a successful retest of it for support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88ray7itwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b1887ef8318559b24735b34cdcff8b458b1478

Between 02/08/2016 and 04/18/2016, Nokia fought to stay above the red 200w MA.

On the week of 04/18/2016, Nokia produced a bearish doji candle at the red 200w MA and finally succumbed to large sell volume from gay bears confirming it as resistance.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vawm55ouwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f887e9f69e05c193357ff0e0585a60dee3fc1cc5

Since that candle, the price of Nokia has fluctuated in a large, 2,009 day range between a high of $6.65 and a low of $2.34.

The 200w MA has been tested and rejected 6 times, with the most recent occurrence being on the trading week of 08/03/2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uar1813vwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31c2d379750c5116c196615bcb95bedd0b44c0e

\-Fibonnaci analysis-

Nokia has stair-stepped down from one Fib to the next ever since confirming the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement as resistance on the week of 01/25/2016.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dbdwivwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=91bc2178b0c8d05b56705413ae1901dc2b01517c

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7k92wzvwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b40681cefa6b65290d02ec3d68c70741fc4e0b

&#x200B;

Nokia then struggled from 02/01/2016 to 07/22/2019 for 1,267 days with breaking and staying above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda

11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da

For approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd

&#x200B;

For the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.

&#x200B;

\-RSI analysis-

This is where shit gets fucking \*interesting\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931

This is the weekly timeframe.

Notice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.

On the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.

The 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33

It is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.

After breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jsnp2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=54cefc4accb3d4ba9cdb8aab9cfdb686b27c234a

This is the 2 week RSI.

Notice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.

This shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.

Notice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67

&#x200B;

This is the 2 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w8ck0em3xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b1582663e94cf7e91bb22587f1751a0f3855f0

50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.

The moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.

&#x200B;

My second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a

40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.

Price moons.

After a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.

Someone is accumulating.

&#x200B;

\-Patterns-

And now, my favorite part of this TA.

Have you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b

&#x200B;

There are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \*could be\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.

If the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.

If both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \*will\* cause FOMO.

I will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()

&#x200B;

Long story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.

If you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.

Especially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?

&#x200B;

I apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.

anyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/TB1ynGAI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TB1ynGAI/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options vs Futures RR It seems that unless your a pro, trading options can put you at huge disadvantage vs trading futures, assuming the leverage is not needed, for example on a call spread capital risked is higher than the potential reward, on futures you can set a stop loss to have the same risk but upside and time is not limited. The only possible advantage for options is there's no stop loss to trigger if the stock fall before it goes back up but this advantage would be offset by futures not limiting profits on a price swing the other way. So it looks like with stocks and futures probability of profit/loss is more constant and fixed to near 50/50 with the chances of market move up or down, but with options probability of loss can be much higher than profit depending on how well you know how to trade options. is this correct?

Another point, some people say not to put stop loss on options which makes sense because the option  is already risk limited and you would lose the no stop trigger advantage but very few people would wait for profits equal to 100% so your always risking more than profit target, not many people trading futures would set a stop loss greater then their profit target. 

New to trading and was wondering if I should be trading futures instead of options, are these points correct or is there some advantage that evens things out that I'm not thinking about?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NIO Leaked Sedan!!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba plans to raise at least $5 billion via dollar bond this month _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Payday?

Most of you know I've been long GameStop since 2017, initially. I am an OG GME bull and yearn for our true value to be recognized by the market. RC Ventures sees it. Many others (Senvest, Michael Burry, Hedgeye, etc.) do as well.

But Melvin Capital does not. They wish we would file for bankruptcy so they can just escape this trade. Alas, they didn't close when the price was $2.57. Greed will be their downfall. But, they are smart. They see the data and for that reason I must enlighten you all about what I am seeing in the data, too. Remember though, one quarter doesn't make or break this thesis.

GameStop 4Q results will be weak, barring a spontaneous console creation event. Holiday results will be weak. The reality is while the future may be brighter than the wasteland the Melvin perceives for GME, the present isn't so great being at your core primarily a B&M retailer. It doesn't matter how in demand your products are if supply isn't there. I placed more notes in the image.

The reality is the order rate had been excellent earlier in the quarter and had been tapering for some time, spiking when resupply events occurred. I had trimmed my estimates previously, but given the continued slowing of the order rate (\~62k/day to start January) and viewing some US CC data that reflects a slowing sales performance as the quarter went on, it is my duty to share my belief that the forthcoming Holiday results will not be that strong. As I noted in my last post, there was also embedded console resupply included in my January base case, I have removed that assumption, too.

But let's not get too upset, fellow retards. While Melvin and its army of bankruptcy believers will spew forth vitriol claiming how weak sales prove nO oNe ShOpS aT gAmEsToP, the truth is they know what is coming from RC Ventures and will look to use any entrance of retail shorts into the trade as a means of  supply purchasing their shares from to cover some. The price may retrace if this proves true, however the reality is RC Ventures has bought at $16, and will likely deem a price under the 50 day MA as an excellent buying opportunity especially if they clearly communicate to the market that the reason for the price appreciation is Ryan Cohen, not George Sherman.

Look, it's a chess match, take the DD aside and think about it. Management reported 3Q and shares tanked. Ryan Cohen bought, and can be seen by observers as the primary catalyst for the upside move. Now, management will report Holiday Sales (and whatever else they have in mind at ICR \[I view a strategic partnership or a smallish technology oriented M&A play as my base case\]) and the price will likely dip next week. Do you believe Ryan Cohen won't take the opportunity to ramp his position up another 2% to 14.9% if the price dips below $15? He will file on Form 4 within two business days and show himself to be the savior, once again. I am speculating, but given the clear preference of WSB, Twitter, and StockTwits for #WeWantCohen its safe to say that retail is on his side. He will likely gather more votes under his own power and from those in alignment with his viewpoint. A forthcoming board slate would be publicized in early March. This is a war, always has been.

Play tactically if you wish, or üíé ‚úã. I would advise against FD buying (in almost all cases, but especially this time). Here's the model.

I'd rather tell it like it is (as the data informs me) rather than put out BS. Hopefully I'm overly conservative. Call me üåà üêª if you must, but I'll own GME longer than 99% of you. Still have a price target of \~$100 by 2023. Cheers

This is my first ever "solo" post. The pun will explain itself here shortly. I also think no one will read this unless I give a shoutout to my primary holdings, $GME. Like many of you, I have a rather large position in GME, but I have size available to trade other tickers as well, so feel free to click away if you got trapped thinking this was a GME post.

So, here is some DD on the EV play $SOLO...

First, I am from Texas, so I drive an "eco-friendly" Chevy 1500 even though I live in the heart of Downtown Houston and would never own an EV car that looks like SOLO's. Although, I am fully aware that my view is not what America and environment-friendly people like. That's fine. I plan on making money from your stupid looking cars. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TRIPOD SOLO CARS, then come back to me. I guess people still drive Kia's after the hamster commercials and Fiat's, so who knows...

So the cool thing about this company is that the cars are only $20k, which is a good market for the broke Starbuck environment hippie employee who lives in a $2,000 a month apt in the city cause that is where the action is. This is a great price point for even the commuters into the city because it's a cheap car that they can drive only to work and back.

Ride Share. I am not sure about everyone here, but my wife loves riding the damn bird scooters, especially when she is drunk. Well, SOLO is trying to create the same thing with their vehicles. Pick up a small tripod and drive them around the city, then drop them off (OBVIOUSLY NOT IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING!!!). This is perfect for people who have to pay to park in the city and don't want to lose their spot. You bet your sweet titties they will pay to rent a Tripod. Even I would drive one of these tripods around to see my boys laugh at me.

Tax Credit. Again, I am from Texas (if you ever met anyone from Texas, you will know because you will tell you 100 times), so I don't have state income tax, but hippies from the west coast could use all the tax breaks they can get. Now you can get a tax credit from owning an EV car. Well, $20k is a lot better than the price of a Tesla... again, I understand these cars don't look like Tesla's. But a wise man once told me, I am not gay, but $20 is $20.

Current Retail Footprint.  All in the west coast.... I WONDER WHY???

1. San Diego, CA
2. Brea, CA
3. Scottsdale, AZ ‚Äî Kierland Commons and Westfield Fashion Square
4. Glendale, AZ
5. Santa Clara, CA
6. Walnut Creek, CA
7. Century City, CA
8. Sherman Oaks, CA
9. Portland, OR

Manufacturing. SOLO is a Canadian company but is expected to announce a new site in the US for manufacturing. Right now, they only have manufacturing in China. This is great news because now they don't have to pay import/export prices from China anymore. They have narrowed the search down to two sites, Arizona and Tennessee. After all, who knows what will happen with whoever our president is coming next month.

Chart Technical. Based on the below, currently while writing this the ticker is at $6.57. I think we could hit a new high of $15 with a small short squeeze and then back to $9. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL!!!!

* Float: 24M
* 52 High: $13.60
* Short %: 12.23%
* Market Cap: 422.26M
* EPS: -0.28

SOLO is Presenting at the 23rd Annual Needham Growth Conference on January 12, 2021. So join in to hear more. This ticker is being picked up on numerous articles, some good, some bad. This is just my DD cause I never see anything on here about SOLO.

TLDR: STAY WOKE ON SOLO, price target $15.

Some businesses were super obvious like cleaning supplies and gaming. But there were secondary effect businesses. For example Home Depot was a good buy when the virus hit because bored dads at home had to find something to get busy to avoid seeing their daughters recording for their OnlyFans page.

Now that vaccine is here, there is gonna be businesses that are going to benefit from a secondary effect. We all know travel is gonna boom with vaccine but what's gonna be like Home Depot this time?

&#x200B;

I propose Starbucks. People (mostly white girls) are going to spend a lot of time outside of home because they fucking hate their family at this point. I can even imagine Starbucks themed TikTok dances that are done with a latte in hand in front of Starbucks.

I bought stocks like a loser but I'm holding onto 200 coffee flavored $SBUX
