 Thoughts on the PTON vs patent infringement + vaccine? &#x200B;

PTON now faces direct competition from apple, a reopening in the near horizon of gyms as well as a population that would rather be anywhere but home, and now this.

Very  curious to see if this will be a turning point.  I always saw PTON as  getting bolstered by COVID beyond what they should truly be valued at.  Am I wrong??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing Based Strictly on Financials/Ratios I am not very versed in the financial statement analysis side of investing (I am well aware that I should be), but I am very interested in increasing my knowledge. So please forgive me if I sound like I have no idea what I’m doing, as I pretty much am a noob. With all of this “buy the rumor sell the news”, I’m having trouble learning what to focus on.

My first question is extremely simple - is there any time that a financial ratio/indicator jumps out to you and makes you say “Holy cow I need to invest now”? If so, does it matter who the company is at this point? Like, are there ever situations where a ratio is just SO good that you auto-invest as it’ll mostly always result in a predicted increase in share price? Or is it too late at this point and the big dogs (algos) have already swooped in?

I am wondering - if you just look ONLY at financial statements/ratios, is that good enough to find companies that will turn a profit? What I mean by this is, putting company names and rumors aside, let’s say I find 10 instances of ratios that are just too good to be true. I then invest in those 10 companies. Is it a given that I’ll be able to turn a profit?

I am pretty sure the answer is obviously no, as this just seems way too easy. But, as someone who’s DD is extremely basic (I read through conversations on Reddit, yahoo finance, and then look up the company’s news), I’m curious about those who weigh financials heavier than anything else_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Real estate/rental property investing: Fix & Flip LOC Was just on the phone talking to a lender about a cashout refinance and he told me that I am a good candidate to recieve a fix & flip line of credit for future ventures.

I'm a buy, fix & rent out person. I don't have much interest in selling houses because of short term capital gains tax. I focus on yearly ROI and long term growth.

I haven't received the terms of it yet-- but I'm just wondering if this is something you guys would recommend I explore aggressively, steer away from completely, or somewhere inbetween.

Any advice or wisdom appreciated_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Might be a dumb question, but how do people flip weekly calls? I’m just learning about the market not really trading yet, I’ve made some money over the past in weed stocks but now obviously trying to take this more seriously, but I read WSB for fun. I see people flipping weekly calls near earnings, how does that work? 

If someone has let’s say 12/18 calls that are dirt cheap, but with the work of some miracle, the stock price moves past the strike, and you sell that call, the person who bought that call, wouldn’t it just expire within a few days, so why even buy it? Or is it because they can just exercise the contract and get their returns that way?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will Energy Roar? I've been struggling lately to come up with good investments to buy.  So many sectors seem to have sky high valuations because the Fed just keeps pumping more & more money into this economy.  I'm not going to try to chase these super trendy companies like Crowdstrike & Zscaler because their valuations are just so detached from reality.

The one sector I think is a good value right now is Energy.  I'm not talking about sexy EV or Green , but Oil & Gas majors such as XOM, Chevron, Oxy, etc.  These stocks are trading literally half where they were pre-pandemic.  But I can only think that after herd immunity is achieved next year, travel will absolutely explode.  Many of the drilling companies have drastically cut back on well drilling & exploration.  I think there will be a lag where oil demand will skyrocket though supply will have a tough time catching up.

I am specifically looking at ETF IXC -  iShares Global Energy ETF.  It has over an 8% dividend yield & its P/E ratio is just above 4!  

Even if the energy stocks return to their pre-pandemic levels, I will have doubled my investment & made off well.  Seems much easier than trying to cherry pick stocks right now during this massively overvalued market.

Does anyone else have some good energy stocks or ETFs that seem like a great deal?  I know a lot of these stocks are out of favor with many, but then these are many of the same people who are buying new SUVs & traveling by air all the time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeking Alpha vs. WSJ vs. Morningstar Premium Looking for a good source of tools, news and data to help in decision-making (I said "help", not "make decisions for me").

I just signed-up for the SA 14 day premium trial to evaluate what they have to offer.  Keeping in mind that I have all of an hour or two of experience with SA, some of the things I like is being able to get data on peers, news and some of the rating stuff.   Yes, I do realize some of the content is user-generated and likely not all that useful.  

I am not necessarily looking for a crystal ball, just easy access to relevant information.  For example, it is truly frustrating to me that my broker's application does not surface any news on positions I hold when I can run a google search and find them.  SA delivered useful news pieces for every symbol I added to the portfolio.  

In other words, when a stock is shooting upwards or sinking, you want quick, easy, organized access to news and insight so you can make decisions.  Yes, you can google around and find everything but that's a ton of work if you are following more than a trivial number of stocks.  This is where a platform that does a good job comes in.

I am interested in opinions about WSJ and Morningstar Premium.  How do they compare to SA (all I know right now) and how are they as tools for investors and traders?

I left out Motley Fool.  I think they were a decent resource twenty years ago (the last time I was active in the market).  Today, based on emails I get and what I've looked at, MF feels like nothing but clickbait garbage.  When you end every email with "Before you buy <XYX> consider these ten stocks..."; yeah, forget it.

Thanks.

\-Martin_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Roundup for the week ended Dec 13th, 2020 **Here’s the market roundup for last week and the forecast for the week ahead.**

The S&P 500, SPX went sideways, moving up on stimulus and vaccine hopes and lower on higher Covid deaths and lockdowns, [a weak jobs report and rising unemployment claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-jobs-report-was-ugly-but-it-may-be-good-news-for-stocks-51607130127?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street). Opening at 3,699, it moved to a new record high of 3,702 but closed the week lower at 3,663 with a small drop of 36 points, [or about 1%.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$SPX/interactive-chart)

The Nasdaq composite, $NASX dropped 0.7%, in tandem, but saw more volatility; from 12,464 it moved to a new high of  12,583 on Tuesday before swinging to a big 2% drop on Wednesday, but recovered to 12,379 by Friday, off just 86 points or [0.7% for the week.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$NASX/interactive-chart)

# Reasons for the drop:

**Fatigue and profit taking**: For the $NASX, the drop was largely due to profit taking after a 6 day winning streak. The Nasdaq had been making new highs after the elections on an almost daily basis and the drop was not unexpected and If it were not for optimism of the skinny stimulus bill passing in the senate, I would have expected a larger drop.

**Lack of stimulus**: Not to belabor the obvious, Congress gave us another head fake. A skinny stimulus package of about $800Bn presented by a bi-partisan group of Democrats and Republicans seemed to have a strong possibility of passing the senate at the beginning of the week, petered out in the usual finger pointing between the two responsible parties.

**Sentiment Overshoot**: Post election the SPX had moved up almost 9%, in what I believe is a sentiment overshoot. Cash levels with fund managers are extremely low at 4%, a level last seem in 2007 and not seen since the great financial crash.

**Too much optimism** – an overbought market: Too many calls and not enough puts. I follow a fairly reliable contrarian indicator called the put/call open interest ratio.

The Put/Call open interest ratio came back to prominence and gained tremendous significance as an indicator in 2020 with the rise in option trading from the Robin Hood cohort.

The put/call open interest ratio looks at the open interest at the end of the day in the total number of put and call options outstanding for the indices, ETF’s and individual stocks. On a historical basis, the open interest ratio for stocks is usually below 1 – that is, traders usually buy more calls than puts. For example, the put/call ratio for Pfizer is 0.2, i.e., or for every put outstanding at the end of  a trading day, there are 4 calls. That’s normal and understandable; with the vaccine, everyone expects Pfizer to rise and who would short it?

This ratio had been flashing warning signals with readings of 0.37 on Dec 7th, 0.35 on Dec 3rd and 0.4 on [Dec 8th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08), meaning that there were 2.5 times more calls than puts. When the ratio is around 0.6 to 0.7 it’s around the mean but when it’s so low it works well a contrarian indicator. - As it did around Feb 23rd when the SPX peaked pre Covid at 3,386. That time as well, the ratio was just 0.38.  It again proved reliable during the week of  June 4th when the SPX had regained most of its COVID losses and had reached 3,232, after which it went into the summer swoon because of the explosion of cases in the Midwest and the imposition of lockdowns. On June 9th the SPX dropped 6%. Similarly, we saw another implosion in late August and early Sep, when the equity open interest ratio flashed  4 ratios of 0.37 to 0.42. At that time, the famous Japanese whale was allegedly playing with $50 Bn of options, most of them FAAMG calls! In a matter of 2 weeks in Sep the SPX lost 9.6% and the $NASX 11.8%. 

The total put call ratio is usually above 1, because it includes open interest of not just stocks , but also includes index and ETF options. And it’s not because there are more shorts than longs, it’s because more traders need to hedge their positions and buying an index, or an ETF put is one of the cheapest ways to do so. This too indicated an overbought market with data points of [0.65 to 0.68](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08). The lowest this ratio had reached in 2020 was in the last week of February, around the pre-Covid peak.

# The Week Ahead

**Stimulus and Vaccine priced in**: Yes, the vaccine will help return us to a new normal, but we still have to navigate a holiday season of travel and social interaction which will make an already macabre season of 235,000 daily new cases and almost 3,000 deaths, worse in the next 3 weeks. I believe that the vaccine and the stimulus is priced in and getting to new highs from here is going to be much more difficult.

The IPO euphoria of Airbnb and Doordash shows a very speculative and overbought market.

Barron’s has a great story on why this is looking a lot like 1999, and one should read this article in its entirety to get what a sense of euphoria looked like. [“Maybe this time is different. Those words, supposedly the most dangerous to utter in the investing realm, came to mind amid the frenzied pops in the highly anticipated initial public offerings of the past week.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/from-airbnb-to-tesla-its-starting-to-feel-like-1999-all-over-again-51607700149?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street)”

I believe the market will remain rangebound in the next week, with the key catalyst being the stimulus or lack of. Since this clearly is in the hands of Congress, I would refrain from trading on any assumptions. However, I do believe the damage will be greater if we don’t get a decent stimulus and the upside limited if we do get one.

Having said that, I do agree with [Nomura’s McElligot](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/10/hot-takes-galore-key-macro-thoughts-and-good-stuff-with-nomuras-mcelligott/), who’s been spot on with his market prognostications in 2020. He believes the long term trend is intact and dips should be bought.

As does Marko Kolanovic, Global head of JP Morgan’s Chase, equity strategy division and another brilliant market strategist. [You can read more about his note here.](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/09/marko-kolanovic-delivers-2021-outlook-a-decline-in-volatility-creates-a-positive-feedback-loop/)

I always track the two indices separately. The tech laden, $NASX has already had a blistering run in 2020. The SPX,  which is composed of 500 stocks, with a much wider range of cyclical stocks has naturally lagged behind the $NASX due to COVID, and still faces significant headwinds even with a vaccine being distributed. So often in the past 6 months, traders have dumped FAANGS (FB, AAPL, AMZN,NFLX, GOOGL) in favor of the airlines and the banks in what is known as the cyclical reflation trade .

How often does the company create totally new shares that did not exist before. 

From a legal standpoint I'm pretty sure every stock thats traded on the electronic market in america needs to announce when it creates new shares... because doing that without making it public sounds like it should be pretty darn illegal...

So I'm wondering. this is super public information so why isn't there some super easy graph that goes back in time and on everyday it shows how many new shares were made. sure most days it would be 0 . but people would be able to see when new shares were created and see how often it happens

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Carnival and Norwegian Cruise lines are cheep again (CCL, NCLH) With vaccines beginning to roll out, it is clear that the travel industry should be back to normal within the couple of months or half a year.

Despite this good news for their industry, Carnival and Norwegian’s stocks have gone down considerably (about 6 or 7 percent each ignoring Norwegian’s pre jump value last Monday).

I’d personally recommend the $30 strike price for Carnival and the $35 for Norwegian with an exoneration sometime between April and January 2022.  Assuming that the stock and tourism industry is almost back to normal by these dates, the calls have the potential to multiply your money from somewhere between 2.5 and 6 depending on the date you choose.

Personally I have multiple 4/21 $30 Carnival calls because I’m fine with some risk, but the 1/22 calls seem like an almost guaranteed way to more than double whatever you put into them, as long as there isn’t a second pandemic, or one of the companies goes bankrupt._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kraft is a good investment both long and short term. Ill keep this as short as possible due to short attention spans. 

I believe that Kraft (KHC) is a great buy right now. Please do your HW before jumping in. 

1) Kraft at its current price of $34 is a classic value stock. Now you will not get your WSB money and make 1000% return on options in a few days, so if that’s what your looking for go to the casino. Now why is it worth a true investment? Consumer habits are changing, people are going out less and eating in more. Job shortage means less money on average for people to spend. Now what do most Americans do when they run short on cash? They stop spending money on food that’s not essential. If you cant figure this out then god bless your soul. 

2) Great dividend of 5% with no plans to cut. Check out the analytics and see where there cash flow is and the newish (2 years on the job) CEO long term plan for the company. They are cutting programs that are losing money and making more profit on ones that are making money. 

3) SKIN IN THE GAME. Top management is taking there own personal wealth and investing it into the company. Just recently once of the directors bought 3million worth of stock at $33 a share. If this doesn’t tell you that kraft isn’t Turing around I don’t know what will. 


I could easily see kraft back up to $50 a share by the end of 2021. Buffet and institutional investors are not dumb. They know how to making a living. Long term this stock is going to be a winner. Like i said do your research! 

(Footnote - 1 thing that i found really weird was all bad articles were owned by Yahoo and there subsidies. One the the Kraft boys must have banged the CEOs daughter at some time because everything they put out is negative. If someone can figure out why i would love to know.

I am currently working with around $15,000 and have been slowly building a portfolio over the past 2 years as I've earned some excess cash from work.

Averaging up just feels wrong to do. 

So instead I find myself buying small stakes in a wide range of companies (max investment is $1500 in SPY). Current portfolio is about 30 different stocks (12 ETFs/Mutual Funds, 18 individual companies). But every individual company stake is only around $100-$300. 

Is the risk worth it to hold individual companies if I remain diversified, or do these small stakes not make any sense when I could effectively achieve the same thing with a few ETFs?

Vehicle seats four and can run for 16 hours before recharging. CEO says Zoox may eventually build package delivery vehicles https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/amazon-s-zoox-unveils-robotaxi-for-future-ride-hailing-service

Zoox Inc., the self-driving startup owned by Amazon.com Inc., unveiled a fully autonomous electric vehicle with no steering wheel that can drive day and night on a single charge.

The vehicle, which Zoox describes as a driverless carriage or robotaxi, can carry as many as four passengers. With a motor at each end, it travels in either direction and maxes out at 75 miles per hour. Two battery packs, one under each row of seats, generate enough juice for 16 hours of run time before recharging, the company said. To commercialize the technology, Zoox plans to launch an app-based ride-hailing service in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas.

“This is really about re-imagining transportation,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Not only do we have the capital required, we have the long-term vision.”

The company also plans to launch ride-hailing services in other countries, Evans said. Executives didn’t say how much rides would cost but that they would be “affordable” and competitive with services operated by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. Nor did they say when the service would launch but confirmed it wouldn’t happen in 2021. In a video released Monday, Evans used Zoox’s app to hail the vehicle outside San Francisco’s Fairmont hotel and took a spin around the block.

Acquired by Amazon in June for an undisclosed sum, Zoox is one of several companies racing to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road, an effort that’s taking longer than anticipated. Most are testing retrofitted conventional cars on public roads, and few are commercially deployed. In October, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving unit Waymo started a fully driverless taxi service in suburban Phoenix. General Motors Co.-backed Cruise LLC is also testing autonomous cars -- recently without safety drivers -- in San Francisco, using a fleet of electric vehicles based on the Chevy Bolt.

Despite being years from deployment, several of Zoox’s quirky-looking mint-green vehicles are already being built at a facility in Fremont, California. The factory has the capacity to eventually produce 10,000 to 15,000 units annually, executives said. Suppliers send the major components -- the drive unit, body, battery pack and so on -- pre-assembled, and Zoox then does final assembly in stages, a process it likens to building a Lego set. Executives declined to reveal the battery supplier.

The unveiling of a production car marks a significant step for a company that has been working on an autonomous passenger vehicle since its founding in 2014. At times Zoox was “ridiculed” for what it was trying to do, Chief Technology Officer Jesse Levinson told Bloomberg TV.

“Unlike many of the concept cars other companies have shown in the last several years this vehicle has passed all the FMVSS crash tests,” Levinson said, referring to tests required by U.S. regulators.
Zoox isn’t the first to unveil a fully autonomous passenger vehicle. GM’s Cruise showed off a battery-powered shuttle in January. Called the Origin, it also does away with many of the controls present in conventional cars: pedals, rearview mirrors, steering wheel. Cruise plans to commercialize the Origin through a ride-sharing service and says it’s cheaper to run than a conventional car.

Zoox’s vehicle is similar but smaller. On each corner a “sensor pod” houses a spinning laser sensor and other lidars and as well as cameras to help it navigate. A pair of front-facing cameras sit atop of the vehicle, with other less-visible sensors mounted on the sides. Each corner pod has a 270-degree field of vision, enabling the car to see more than 360 degrees of terrain at once.

The vehicle’s safety features include airbags that form a cocoon around each passenger in the event of a crash, which Zoox says is unlikely given its confidence in the technology. The company can manually operate the vehicles remotely and communicate with passengers in real time. For those worried about privacy, Zoox says passengers will have the option to blur images captured by the on-board camera.

When Amazon acquired Zoox, industry watchers speculated that the e-commerce giant eventually planned to deploy fleets of driverless delivery vehicles. In the interview, Evans said there are currently no plans to do so but acknowledged that “at some point we could move packages.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ With Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being distributed and countries competing over supplies, why do their stocks seem to be not doing much?

So I’m not necessarily a day trader so I’m not glued to my portfolio or news about my holdings. That said I was checking things out this morning and noted one of my holdings, VRSSF, is going through a reverse stock split (16-1). I understand what’s happening but am curious if any of you have had this happen with one of your holdings and whether you can share whether it ultimately had a positive or negative effect on the stock’s performance. TIA!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Walmart a good investment?   Is Walmart (WMT) a good investment? I feel like it is and would like to hear some counterarguments.

First, it has been, and still is, a terrific defensive stock. It has effectively outperformed the market during some of the most difficult periods for investors: it’s stock price grew during the 70’s, and withstood the tech bubble, the 2008 Financial Crisis and the recent pandemic (i.e. saw a limited drop in stock value).

Furthermore, with Walmart holding a majority stake in Flipkart (77%; i.e. India’s Amazon), a 12% stake in JD.com (i.e. China’s Amazon), all the while rapidly transforming itself to adapt to the growing trend in e-commerce, I see a lot of growth potential in Walmart. At the very least, it is not letting itself become obsolete – many commentators highlighted the uncertain future of retail with the advent of ecommerce, and giants such as Amazon. WMT is also embracing automatization, even if they recently decided to stop using robots to track inventory, for now. 

Finally, valuation-wise, it looks to me like it is treading at a considerably more attractive price than other major retailers (eg. Costco, Amazon, JD, etc.).

Anyways, I was simply curious to know if anyone had an idea of the risks associated with investing in Walmart.

VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / December 14, 2020 / Havn Life Sciences Inc. (OTC:HAVLF Stock Report)(CSE:HAVN)(FSE:5NP) (the “Company” or “Havn Life”), a Canadian biotechnology company pursuing standardized extraction of psychoactive compounds, the development of natural healthcare products, is pleased to announce the first preclinical study to focus on the effects of psilocybin on the immune system, in partnership with Dr. Geoffrey Bove, Dr. David Mokler and Susan Chapelle, eMBA.

The Company’s science division, Havn Research, is undertaking a study to determine if a single dose of psilocybin extract can impact the body’s inflammatory response and regulate the human immune system.

The Havn Life team will begin this preclinical study in Q1 2021. This study is the first step required to file an application for the development of psilocybin delivery methods that could address inflammatory and immune diseases such as arthritis.

Vic Neufeld, Executive Chairman of Havn Life stated: “We are tremendously excited about the potential to accelerate drug discovery and patient access to psilocybin based compounds. Upon completion of this initial phase, the Havn Life team will have taken the first step on its journey towards market authorization of new medicines. We intend to pursue the filing of an FDA application for psilocybin-based delivery methods, which may ultimately lead to new drug discovery. To date, minimal research has been done on psilocybin and its effects on human immunity, which is an area that has become more and more important.”

Although there is discussion related to the possible effects of psilocybin on inflammation, there has been no research on psilocybin’s impact on the immune system. This will be the one of the first studies to quantify the effects of psilocybin on the immune system and will also compare the differences in how psilocybin affects the immune system between the sexes.

“This is an exciting new application for psilocybin that has not yet been researched. The work is essential to understanding the safety profile of psilocybin and developing medicines to help support human health,” says Susan Chapelle. “The findings could lead to significant discoveries in the treatments of inflammatory diseases that have a profound negative effect on so many, such as pain, neuropathy and arthritis.”

About the Study

The Havn Life study will be conducted in the United States at Dr. Bove’s biomedical centre, in Maine.

The principal researchers will be Doctor Geoffrey Bove, Doctor David Mokler, and Susan Chapelle, EVP of Research and Development at Havn Life, who each have extensive clinical experience in wound healing, pain receptors, psychedelic and pharmacology research. They jointly published a research paper on post-operative adhesions in 2017. The study findings laid the groundwork for further research on mechanical and pharmacologic approaches for post-operative.

Doctor Mokler, is an advisor for Havn Life and has a dual doctorate Pharmacology/Toxicology and Neurosciences from Michigan State University. His research, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, focuses on the limbic (emotion/behavior) system of the brain, and the role of serotonin in the limbic system.

Susan Chapelle, eMBA is an expert in wound healing and has co-authored 6 publications in peer reviewed journals. She is a noted international Keynote Speaker and industry expert on research, science education, urban transformation, cannabis and psychedelics policy, and technology integrations.

Geoffrey Bove, DC PhD is a career neurobiologist and chiropractor who researches pain mechanisms, especially as related to physical diagnosis and manual therapies. He has been independently funded by the National Institutes of Health and other institutions for 30 years. Previously faculty at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Bove conducts research at his private laboratory, Bove Consulting.

Author: J. Phillip_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LOOP Announces Independent Review Confirming Effectiveness of Patented Technology [http://irdirect.net/prviewer/release\_only/id/4564541](http://irdirect.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4564541)

Loop Industries (LOOP) was shorted by Hindenburg in October shortly after they shorted NKLA. I haven't seen nearly as much hoopla about this one, but this morning LOOP sent out a press release announcing they hired an independent third party lab to verify their patented Gen II PET depolymerization technology. The review is also a part of their [8-K](http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1504678/000165495420013498/lp_8k.pdf) that was release today.

I certainly am not an expert in this field but this seems to be good news. Here are a few of the main points of the release's conclusion.

*"The Kemitek team was able to understand, witness and verify the execution of Loop's Gen II polyethylene terephthalate (PET) depolymerization technology from feedstock to monomers. While the verification was not intended to certify the yields or economic viability of the technology, as these were out of the scope of our mandate, our observations confirmed the production of significant quantities of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) from a post-consumer waste PET feedstock at both mini-pilot and pilot scales.*

*Characterization of the finished products also confirmed that the quality of the primary PET plastic building blocks meet Loop's specifications for the production of PET resin and polyester fiber, achieving DMT purity ranging from 99.7% to 100.1%****\[1\]*** *(w/w) and MEG purity ranging from 98.2% to 98.9% (w/w). The useful monomer content for the MEG product is greater than 99.0% (w/w). This is calculated by adding the secondary PET plastic building blocks present in the final MEG product: Dimethyl isophthalate (DMI), Dimethyl Terephthalate (DMT), Diethylene Glycol (DEG), Bis-(2-Hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)4-methylterephthalate (MHET) and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)4-methylisophthalate (MHEI). It is reasonable to expect these molecules to be integrated into the final polymer chains of the PET resin and polyester fiber.*

*Kemitek's findings through this verification allow us to attest to the capacity of Loop's technology to produce pure monomers within their specifications. Kemitek conducted this verification in an independent manner using rigorous methodology and we ensured process integrity during the three-week testing period via surveillance, sampling and seals."*

tl;dr The title

Currently have no positions in Loop (sold when Hindenburg advisory was released), but I can say I am a big fan of what they are trying to do with their technology. The inability of plastics to be effectively recycled is a huge problem for the future of our planet and economy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Invesco Funds looking to reclassify as “non-diversified” Like some of you, I’m sure, I’ve received proxy materials from Invesco about a push to reclassify all their funds from “diversified” to “non-diversified”.

Domino’s competes in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza industry with various competitors. The U.S. market is estimated to be \~$37.8bn and steadily growing.  This is the second-largest category in the broader $279bn QSR market. The QSR pizza industry is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in, and carryout. Unsurprisingly carryout and delivery are the two largest segments.

Domino’s is the leading market share leader for U.S. pizza delivery and the second-largest market share for carryout. The four industry leaders, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s Pizza, Domino’s, and Little Caesars Pizza account for 61% of the U.S. pizza delivery market and 51% of the carryout market.

The international pizza market is more underdeveloped than the United States. Domino’s is one of three companies with a global presence.

**Business Overview**

Domino’s was founded in 1960 by two brothers. The two brothers initially focused on opening stores near college campuses and military bases. Fast forward almost three decades and Bain Capital buys 93% of the business in 1998. A few years later, Bain proceeds to IPO Domino’s in 2004, and it’s been a public company ever since.

Domino’s has three different revenue segments:

* U.S. Stores
* International Franchises
* Supply Chain

We’ll dig into these different business lines and how they all work.

**U.S. Stores**

U.S. stores consist of both company-owned stores and franchised stores. Roughly 6% of all U.S. stores are company-owned. These stores are typically used for testing sites for new innovation as well as training and developing future talent.

There are more than 6,100 U.S. stores, with \~340 stores being company-owned and \~5,800 being franchisees. The \~5,800 franchised stores are operated by 777 U.S. franchisees. These franchisees are able to benefit from Domino’s brand image with a low capital investment. The largest U.S franchisee operates more than 176 locations.

Domino’s has a rigorous process for U.S. franchisees. Those interested in being a franchisee must manage a store for at least a year and graduate from its franchise management school program. This is successful as there is a 99% franchise agreement renewal rate. Franchisees must pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales and certain technology fees.

Stores must also contribute 6% of sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. These contributions go into Domino’s National Advertising Fund, which is a not-for-profit advertising subsidiary of Domino’s.

**International Franchises**

Domino’s has more than 10,894 international franchises in more than 90 markets. The main source of revenue from these stores is royalty payments. Domino’s top ten international markets account for 63% of international stores.

Domino’s grants franchisees exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic regions. This means they can create their own Domino’s in international markets. They control the franchisee options, the supply chain centers, and other decisions. These franchisees pay an initial one-time franchise fee and a fee upon the opening of each additional store. The master franchisee pays a continuous 3.0% royalty fee on sales,

**Supply Chain**

Domino’s operates 19 dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers, 1 thin crust manufacturing center, 1 vegetable processing center, and 1 center providing equipment and supplies to U.S. and some international stores. The management team is continuously looking to expand and build more centers.

Domino’s sells food and supplies to more than 6,600 stores. Domino’s believes that franchisees buy directly from them due to cost savings, efficiencies, quality offerings, and consistency. Franchisees also benefit from profit-sharing arrangements with supply chain centers. This program offers participating franchisees 50% of its regional supply chain center’s pre-tax profits.

**Total Addressable Market**

The global QSR pizza market is already well established with the biggest opportunity being in expanding in international markets and same-store sales growth in more established markets such as the U.S. One of my main concerns is just how big the pizza market can be. I feel as though the pizza market is already well-established, but Domino’s talks about their fortressing strategy which is adding more Domino’s stores within one area to improve on delivery times, customer service, and cost efficiencies (cheaper to deliver pizza the closer the customer), and other important areas.

**Competitive Advantages**

1. **Brand**Domino’s is one of the strongest brands in the world. They benefit from brand recognition almost anywhere you go in the United States and I’d bet it’d be similar in some foreign countries. There are definitely some die-hard Domino’s fans and then there’s also your local pizza restaurants that arguably have better pizza than Domino’s but these companies can’t compete on price. Basically, when ordering from Domino’s you know what you’re getting.
2. **Scale**Since Domino’s is the largest pizza company, it’s able to benefit from economies of scale through purchasing power over suppliers, can test changes on a small scale, and then roll these features out globally. Scale also gives Domino’s the benefit of operating leverage. As the international franchise store count grows, Domino’s will collect royalty fees that do not require extensive operating margins so operating margins grow slower than international royalty fees giving Domino’s operating leverage for this segment of the business. The same can be said for US stores that are not company-owned.

**Financials**

Domino’s breaks down revenue into U.S. stores which include company-owned stores, franchise stores, U.S. franchise advertising, then supply chain, and international franchise royalties and fees. Other important financial numbers are global retail sales growth, same-store sales growth, and total store count. These numbers are all listed below.

**2019:**

* Total revenue = \~$3.6bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$1.3bn
* Supply chain = \~$2.1bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.6bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 8.0%
* Total store count = 17,020
* U.S. stores = 6,126
* International stores = 10,894

**2018:**

* Total revenue = \~$3.4bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$1.3bn
* Supply chain = \~$2.0bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.6bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 10.8%
* Total store count = 15,914
* U.S. stores = 5,876
* International stores = 10,038

**2017:**

* Total revenue = \~$2.7bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$0.8bn (but did not include advertising revenue)
* Supply chain = \~$1.7bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.5bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 13.0%
* Total store count = 14,856
* U.S. stores = 5,587
* International stores = 9,269

**What’s Interesting**

Domino’s has outperformed Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies since it’s IPO in 2004. This isn’t random. Domino’s has been able to build a brand and continue to expand in the U.S. and internationally while rewarding shareholders.

Domino’s has a share repurchase program and also dolls out dividends each year. This combined with revenue and net income growth is a good recipe for any successful company.

Domino’s also seems to be the original cloud kitchen model. Many of its stores do not include seating which would increase capital expenditures. The majority of Domino’s business is carryout or delivery.

**Future Questions**

1. **How long is Domino’s runway?** Domino’s is already a mature company with more than 17,000 stores worldwide. Future growth will come from cost efficiencies and some store openings, but I feel like it’d be hard for Domino’s to make a case that store count can double worldwide because of how many stores are already in existence. International store count can probably double at some point in time, but going from even \~11,000 international stores to \~22,000 will be a big challenge. The good part is that royalties and other fees associated with international franchises are basically pure profit since international franchises are operated by a master franchisee that takes care of all the headaches in foreign countries. Through operating leverage, if the international franchise store count doubles, then the profit will more than double. Domino’s only has a market cap of \~$15bn meanwhile companies like McDonald’s have a market cap of \~$150bn. Domino’s definitely has room to expand, so if I were to do a deep dive on Domino’s I’d have to answer the question of how many stores can Domino’s operate throughout the world.
2. **What effect does Uber, Grubhub, DoorDash, and the food delivery market have on pizza delivery and carryout?** In the past, carryout and delivery were typically done by pizza companies. These companies often don’t have any seating in their stores and therefore benefit by having less capital tied up in stores rather than inventory, buying back shares, or paying dividends. Families, college students, and professionals would order a pizza rather than ordering a bunch of different food from a Chinese restaurant or whatever other food option there is available. How does the new wave of food delivery companies impact pizza’s delivery and carryout appeal? Do families increasingly order from somewhere else instead of the pastime of fresh pizza delivery? Are the costs of ordering from Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash too expensive for a typical family of 4? Does the cheap cost of pizza relative to other options give Domino’s and its pizza staying power in this new age of food delivery?

**Conclusion**

Domino’s is an interesting company that I’d have to put in the more mature bucket. It’d be interesting to figure out if food delivery is a net positive or net negative for Domino’s and other pizza companies. Domino’s has historically been a great investment for hopefully many people, but it might be too late for me. Domino’s is already at the stage of giving out dividends to its shareholder base and that’s not what I’m personally looking for. I’m a young investor so I’m looking for growth and I’m not worried about short-term volatility in the pursuit of long-term gains.

**Fun Facts**

There are international Domino’s franchises that are public companies. Not all of these companies are specific to Domino’s and these firms often combine various franchises into one holding company. But here’s a shortlist:

* ASX: DMP - Domino’s Pizza Enterprises
* BMV: ALSEA - Alsea
* L: DOM - Domino’s Pizza Group
* L: DPEU - DP Eurasia
* NS: JUBLFOOD - Jubilant Foodworks

Domino’s has very different food options depending on local customs. Some of these were highlighted throughout Domino’s 10-K such as the Mayo Jaga in Japan (bacon, potatoes, and sweet mayonnaise), the Saumoneta in France (light cream, potatoes, onions, smoked salmon, and dill), and some others. I thought these were funny and it’s always interesting to learn more about different customs in foreign markets.

From your own experience, how realistic is it for a retail investor with above-average intelligence who's emotionally stable enough not to make rash decisions and an eagerness to keep learning about the stock market to make at least 10% profits from their investments consistently on a yearly basis? 

I'm wondering because I keep reading that it's highly unlikely to outperform the market (as far as I'm not mistaken, a yearly ROI of 10% would signify an outperformance of the market, ), at least on a consistent basis. Though the more I think about it and the more time passes since I've started investing (admittedly, I've started only a short time ago, but I feel like I already know a lot more compared to when I started out), the more I think it's very well possible and not that unrealistic at all to consistently achieve yearly returns of 10%. If you're knowledgeable about the company you're intending on buying stocks from respectively if you've done your homework, before buying a company's shares (e.g. studying balance sheets, making sure you understand the business model, the industry, competitors, long-term demand in the future of the goods a company produces etc.), you should be able to significantly improve your odds of picking "winners" and avoiding "losers"? 

For example, the DAX index (Germany) composes of the thirty biggest German companies based on market cap listed on the German stock exchange. Let's assume half of them have a yearly growth rate of 0-7,5% while the other half has a yearly growth rate of 7,5-15%. Let's call the first half "losers" (they're not really losers since they're still profitable, yet still less profitable than the other half I'm comparing them to) and the second half "winners". If you invested into a DAX index fund, you'd be basically buying stocks from all those thirty companies, among them 15 companies that perform "badly". 

Now let's assume an investor, who does his homework, decides to buy ten stocks from DAX-listed companies. If he does his research well, 8 of his stocks will turn out "winners" per definition from above while 2 of them will turn out "losers". In other words: he'd have picked 8 companies with ROI within the range from 7,5-15% and two companies who's ROI are within the 0-7,5% range. If he'd invested in the DAX index fund, he'd have picked 5 "winning" companies and 5 "losing" companies, if we take my second paragraph into consideration, which is just a fictional example and thus to be taken with a grain of salt. Now, in this scenario the retail investor with 8 winners/2 losers can expect better yearly results than the one who invests in the whole DAX index fund, since he was able to "weed out" the "losers" more efficiently while increasing the amount of losers in his portfolio, right? If yes, the retail investor who picks his stocks himself could consequently could expect to outperform the market. Granted he knows how to research a company of course.

I am researching the possibility of buying shares in Freddie and Fannie. 
I understand the basics of the situation. I have a couple questions, for anyone who has a decently well informed opinion/speculation on this matter.
Does the tresury secretary have the authority to take these companies out of conservatorship or is that power bestowed to the house or the senate or the supreme court?
can the supreme court override whoever has the first authority on this issue?
do republicans favor or disfavor the idea of ending conservatorship?

logically, if the company cannot recapitalized, then the point of it going into a bailout-debt makes no sense. so when is this going to happen? 

is it pretty much a given that if the company is either allowed to recapitalize or end conservatorship the stock prices will rise or it is not so clear cut?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

Does an ETF's price (for example ARKK currently listed at 123 usd at time of writing) reflect the "popularity" of the ETF - as in, the buying and selling of people buying into the ETF? *or* does it reflect the value/growth of the holdings within the ETF?

I realize that most passive funds/etfs simply follow an "index" of stocks, but an actively managed one will be constantly buying/selling their holdings. I'm just a bit confused about what the price of the ETF is actually reflecting.

To try to illustrate the question better: ARKK currently holds a high share of Tesla. Say, hypothetically, the Tesla stock sees a large drop - would this be reflected in the price of the ETF? I am assuming it *would*, unless Ark Invest sell off this stock in anticipation for said drop?
Or would there only be a drop in price if people invested in the ETF sell out of the ETF?

I use the 180D/4H chart exclusively. 
10, 50, 200 EMA Lines, RSI, Stochastic, and MACD are the indicators I use. 

Check my profile for photos. 

$AEP - Developed a double bottom basically, and now retesting this very strong support. The POC volume area is above pulling it up, and has plenty of room to run. I love the price action set up. RSI is oversold.

$AMRX - Massive trendline it is living at again, at a support, with the volume node pulling it u. RSI and Stochastic oversold, and this support is historically very strong.

$CAH - 70% Volume area support holding, and above the 200EMA. Stochastic and RSI oversold - so it has room to run up here. But that is it, it certainly has some room to drop.

$CLNE - Very large scale triangle forming, and it is holding at this support inside of the triangle. If it does take off, it is going to be crazy strong. It is also holding this 50EMA which is awesome to see.

$DKS - Old resistance being tested as a support again here. Stochastic is low and RSI is oversold. MACD cannot get much lower. There is also a very pretty uptrend it seems to be respecting as well.

$EPRT - Once again; old resistance being tested as a support now. 50EMA is helping to hold it up, and it is obviously up trending. If it lives here go long. Stochastic and RSI are oversold.

$EQT - Simply put - simple channel play up; support, and being bounced near the POC volume node at this moment. Looking great to go long.

$FR - This up-trending line has been very strong for months and here we are again. If it breaks the 200ENa again it'll be great. RSI and Stochastic are oversold as well.

$HLT - Simple channel play. At support inside this baby channel forming, if it holds up here an easy 6%.

$KNL - Testing resistance as support again, 50EMA support, and very close to an uptrend line? Love this set up with Stochastic being so low!

$LUV - New resistance being tested, and formed a double bottom. This has room to drop still, where it may have a great bounce at the 200EMA. But it is a great channel.

$MLCO - Formed a new channel, and it has some room to drop. Let it hit $18 and play off of it there, but Stochastic is very low which I love.

$PEG - Beautiful uptrend channel play, at a support, with RSI under 30!? Love it, this will be a nice simple play here.

$SKX - Steep trend up, in channel that is re-testing a resistance as a support here. Stoch and RSI look good, if it lives here it should be a screamer!

$SPT - Up trending channel again, at a support, that is also above the 200EMA? Beautiful! Bullish Divergence and Stochastic with RSI oversold, love it!

$TJX - Channel up, with a support AND 50EMA beneath it, simple enough - and ride it while you can!

$UMPQ - Exact same play as $TJX ^.

$VMC - Beautiful channel up - which is gorgeous. 
Support and 200EMA beneath it, I think this is a gorgeous set up. RSI and Stochastic also oversold - love it even more.

$WCN - Same exact set up as $WCN ^.

$WDAY - Same exact play as $WCN as well ^._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do some stocks have insane prices in their far past?

[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/dcf-formula-guide/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/dcf-formula-guide/)

First, I'll start by saying that I don't quite conceptually grasp the relevance or purpose of the terminal value.

Regardless, this explains that there are two methods for calculating this: exit multiple and perpetual growth. Exit multiple is easy to understand but perpetual growth seems like nothing short of a smooth brained assumption. The concept of TAM is not arbitrary and is a real constraint on the growth of a business. Additionally, inputs might be able to decline but ultimately can never be negative. Given those two realities, perpetual growth is literally impossible so why would it ever be used as an assumption in this sort of discount model?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Afterpay $APT.AX joins ASX 20 >Afterpay's phenomenal growth shows no sign of slowing as the company becomes one of the 20 biggest on the share market.

With BNPL becoming more mainstream it will be interesting to see if this category becomes a serious competitor to credit cards in 5 years. 

At a $23B USD valuation, Afterpay is still relatively small compared to many major payment processors, banks, credit card issuers, Visa/MC, PayPal, and Amex.

If it can eat away at card payments and build itself as something like an Amex (network and issued) or PayPal I can see it going much higher. Trend appears in their favor. Very bullish._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options Trading (Fighting the Theta Decay) 
Hello investors,

I wanted to dedicate a whole post to understanding the role of theta when making your buy/sell decisions on your options.

For those new to options, theta is the amount by which the option's price declines over its life period.

An option today is worth more than the same option a month from now simply due to the longer life, all else equal. It's similar to depreciation, though caused by a totally different reason.

From CME Group:

"Theta is **highest for at-the-money (ATM) options** and **lower the further out-the-money** or in-the-money the option is. The absolute value of theta of an option that is at- or near-the-money rises as the option approaches expiration. Theta for an option that is deep in- or out- the-money falls as the option approaches expiration."

(Apologies for the unavailable pictures. Please see https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/kcpzpq/options_trading_part_iii_fighting_the_theta_decay/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf for the pictures.)

&#x200B;

*Processing img ty8vebn2nv461...*

"Because time-value erosion is not linear, Theta of at-the-money (ATM), just slightly out-of-the-money and in-the-money (ITM) options generally increases as expiration approaches, while Theta of far out-of-the-money (OTM) options generally decreases as expiration approaches."

For example, please note the following table of Fiverr International Ltd (FVRR), which closed at $201 on Friday 12/11/2020.

&#x200B;

*Processing img 7ftzk1roh2561...*

Based on this table, we will decide 1) what strike price and 2) which expiration dates offer the most value for us.

1. Deciding on the strike price

If you noticed, theta for the ATM option is the highest compared to the other 3, at -0.141 for the Medium term option. That means in 1 month, you will lose $4.23 (-$0.141\*30 days = $4.23). We are trying to spend as little as possible for holding an option so this one is out.

The lowest theta is deep ITM option. However, as we discussed in the Options Trading Part I ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jvivvt/options\_trading\_part\_i\_which\_options\_to\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jvivvt/options_trading_part_i_which_options_to_buy/)), we are trying to get the best risk/reward on each option we buy so we rule this one out as well.

We are now left with 280C and 300C options.

Based only on theta, we would choose 300C.

However, if you expect the stock price to move by a small magnitude, you would be better off with 280C. If you expect large price volatility, then 300C is the better choice. It really depends on your expected magnitude of the price movement.

2) Deciding on the expiration date

The answer to this question is dependent on your holding period.

If you are expecting the stock to appreciate in the short term, the shorter expiration date will work better.

With that said, I would caution against holding any weekly, or even monthly options because the theta decay is enormous.

As an example, consider FVRR 300C 4/16/21 (OTM 4 months to expiration).

Your initial returns graph looks like this.

&#x200B;

*Processing img 7i5aanono2561...*

It's all nice looking until we hold it for 1 month.

&#x200B;

*Processing img e3ob7asro2561...*

You lose a whopping 35% of value in one month.

To be holding a relatively short-period option, you want to have a relatively high conviction that your thesis on the stock will play out in a relatively short amount of time because theta decay is simply too big.

If you need a few months for the stock to play out your thesis, you probably want long-dated options, even more than 1 year to take advantage of the cap gains tax.

Personally, I don't hold onto options for too long, and never let them expire for that matter. I don't hold anything that are closer than 3-4 months to the expiration. And those shorter ones that I do hold are ones that I have very high conviction on due to a variety of reasons.

With that said, you don't want to be selling options 3 weeks into it simply because you are afraid of the theta decay. If you still have 5 months till expiration, that price appreciation can offset any theta decay you had.

Panic selling is one of the key cognitive biases that prevent most people from making profits.

The bottom line is, shorter period options are risky considering how much more theta decay plays a role compared to the intermediate and longer period options.

Theta decay alone shouldn't determine your strike price or holding period but it should certainly be considered as a part of your decision-making process, aka piecing the puzzle together per the Mosaic Theory ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing\_philosophy\_plz\_read\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/)).

The more I read articles, Reddit and watch youtube videos about the low interest rates, the central banks prolonged plans to keep them low among other things, the more comments I see people say like "Having any cash on hand right now is a complete waste". More and more people are saying holding cash is stupid and to invest in equities or assets because it can't fail right now. What's your opinion on this? Is the market impenetrable to a crash right now?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ As we approach tax season, make sure you understand tax-loss harvesting Tax-loss harvesting is a great way to reduce current taxable income. This can be effective to lower the tax bracket or tax bill for the current year. However, keep in mind that unless you take the tax savings and reinvest along with the rest of the capital in the portfolio, you haven't gained any value. 

Simply deferring the tax bill will not leave you any better off, unless you just want to spend the tax savings on fun stuff. You need to invest the tax savings to get the total benefit of tax loss harvesting. As you can read in the article below, it's essentially an interest free loan from the government. But, you will still pay taxes on the gain in the future! With preferential long-tern cap gains rates, this can reduce but not eliminate the tax bill. 

Tax alpha is not as large as many 'tax-aware advisors' will proclaim. Basic analysis shows that the value add is much less than 1%, closer to 33bps/0.33%. This can add up in the long term, but be careful of advisors selling you on tax managed strategies that are much higher than the actual economic value added by higher turnover strategies.

Do many investors take this advice?

I have thought about this quote, and applying it to the current market, and it made me think that because unemployment is high and the real economy is dipping, investors assume that people are fearful and therefore they are greedy.

But if investors are greedy due to the belief that others are fearful, is it prudent to be fearful?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I Think Lemonade (LMND) is a Great Long Term Stock (Looking for Constructive Criticism) **Preface:** I have doing a lot of research into LMND lately and I really feel like this stock could 10X in the next 5 to 10 years. With that being said I definitely have some blind spots and made some mistakes before so I am looking for people of the opposing view to convince me against investing in Lemonade. Also, I'll try to be concise because I *hate* reading long fluff posts.

**Total Addressable Market:** Insurance is a huge industry (5 trillion dollars worldwide), but more importantly the general sentiment towards insurance is disgust. Any company that can change this relationship and gain market share will inevitably grow a lot.

**Competition:** Having a large market size does not guarantee success, a company must offer a far better product at a lower price to truly disrupt, this is where competition comes in. Two examples of competitors that I see on the startup level are Root and Metro mile. This is where I believe that Lemonade is fundamentally different than their startup competitors. Companies like Metromile seem to lack the ambition to truly build a lasting brand as they are targeting a small subsection of the auto market that barely drives. I am not suggesting that Metro mile can't be successful, however I am suggesting that they will not be able to build a lasting brand. On the other side, Lemonade seems to be a company that is not satisfied with constraints, rather they are focused on expanding their offerings and countries. I really believe that a company needs to have almost a crazy amount of ambition to be successful, and Lemonade is showing that in their aggressive desire to expand into all types of insurance and multiple countries. With that being said I do acknowledge that flying to close to the sun can be dangerous, Lemonade could run out of money in their pursuit of expansive growth. Overall, if I had to bet I would bet on the company that is being ambitious and trying to become a large multinational brand.

**Technological Advantages:** Mark Cuban recently mentioned that in the future there will be two companies, the AI have and have nots. ***I whole heartedly disagree with this.*** I believe that in the future there will be three types of companies. First companies that do not have AI, second companies that do have and actually use meaningful AI, and third companies that act like they have AI just to warrant a high valuation. I study and work in computer science and it is honestly downright disgusting to see how many companies use buzz words like AI and Machine Learning to get a higher valuation. With that being said I think Lemonade is most likely not one of those companies. While I don't buy some of their general "wE uSe aRtiFicIaL iTellIgeNcE" claims I do really like their tech stack in terms of the automation of claims and unified systems. I think people generally underestimate how fragmented legacy software systems are, Lemonade's systems that are built from the ground up with automation and efficiency in mind seem like genuine step forward in the right direction. Examples of this can be found in that 33% of all claims are paid within seconds through their chatbot. Also even for the claims that are unable to be paid be a bot, the information is collected by the bot and laid out conveniently for the customer service rep to be able to quickly finish the job. The most important thing is that they are able to do this while maintaining a respectable loss ratio (around 70%). I know a lot of people will say that existing companies will just copy the software but I find it extremely difficult to believe that such large companies will conduct a full software rewrite. Instead they will probably only add some fractions of the functionality which will have a smaller effect. 

**Management:** This part is a bit subjective as people can have different opinions and management style. Over the past few weeks I have been listening to all the interviews I can find as well as reading  blog posts. I have come to the conclusion people in management such as Shai, Daniel, and Tim are fantastic. Daniel seems to have a clear view of what he wants the company to be and Shai has a track record of success through building Fiverr.

**Downsides:** I want to acknowledge that no investment is perfect and this is why I want opposing opinions and a discussion. Firstly, the incumbent insurance companies are extremely powerful and will likely not easily give up market share. Insurance companies have large regulatory hurdles and the big companies are some of the biggest lobbyist. Lemonade could be wiped out as soon as they start to get big by some of the bigger incumbents who have both regulatory and capital advantages. Secondly, relating to the capital advantages, Lemonade runs a very real risk of running out of money with their current economics, I hope that the company will continue to have access to capital as the grow because the might really need it. 

**Conclusion:** If Lemonade can continue to rapidly grow their topline while maintaining unit economics I believe that they will be a fantastic investment. Even though they are losing money now, they can continue to grow and become profitable. They have customers who have smaller and lower cost policies (renter's insurance) who will eventually grow in wealth and buy more insurance. While other insurance companies are spending tons of money on marketing and advertising, Lemonade will see their revenue increase (with minimal effort) as their customers (most of whom are young) grow their insurable assets.
