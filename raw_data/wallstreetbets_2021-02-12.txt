 $RKT ready for take-off... Warning this is HIGHLY speculative, but data points to it as a possibility.

First, Dan Gilbert and Warren Buffet are friends. This we know.

Second, according to the IPO, RHI (AKA Dan Gilbert) via the Class D shares retains 79% of the voting power, but currently has 94.2% of the economic interest based on his holdings of 94.2% of the total stock. It's therefore likely out of any deals he wishes to retain that 79% interest in the stock/voting(this becomes important later).

Third, between Berkshire's 13f filing on 11/16 (with a portion submitted separately as confidential), it was widely reported Buffet had plans for a "secret" investment, but how much and in what company?

The how much we know, the difference between their 13f and 10q filings (minus some foreign investments) is approximately $9 billion. Then there is the what? We do know his largest reductions were in bank stocks(the biggest reduction being in Wells Fargo), but does buffet really want to move away from finance or maybe he just wants to reposition in finance away from traditional banks.

If it's the latter, $RKT makes sense, but how do you buy $9 billion of a $40 billion company without anyone knowing? Timing....

$RKT reports on the 25th after various organizations have to report on the 16th (15th is a financial holiday). Over a 5% stake has to be reported within 10 days. RHI reported it's holdings early in the month. If RHI wants to they can convert 15.2%(94.2% - 79%) equivalent of the total outstanding stock from Class D to Class A in a private equity sale(AKA Black Book) so as not to directly affect the stock price, not report it for up to 10 days, and keep their 79% vote share/Economic interest. Then Berkshire can report their 13f and a bit later file their 10q on the purchase. With $RKT reporting the "big partnership" just before ER to maxmize momentum going in to it. 

Relationships, nummbers, dates for filing and chosen, all lead me to believe $RKT is the secret Buffet investment and plans to acquire about 25% of the company. This also means with four profitable quarters(the fourth being announce on the 25th) $RKT would also be eligible for S&P inclusion(due to the float increase) adding further value to the acquisition. All that plus the high short interest scrambling to get out(and Buffet followers scrambling to get in) and $RKT could soon be a multi-bagger in short order.

Note: 9 billion was likely based on the original $27 for 150 mil share original prospectus, but likely the deal changed after $RKT hasn't performed as well and likely the $1 billion buyback was announced to help that performance(Buffet thinks buybacks should be used for price support by companies so it follows his theory on their use).

Edit: I'd watch to see if the 13f still shows confidential as the lock-up didn't end until 02/02 and the transaction would likely be scheduled for the 16th so it doesn't need to be reported for 10 days, aka the 26th which just happens to be the day after RKT's ER call. Also, no other company has reported 5%+ new economic ownership by Berkshire since their Nov. 16th 13f.

Edit 2: It also makes sense from a non-investment business perspective. It would provide synchronicity with other Buffet holdings. It would help with Gieco(mortgage customers to Geico and Geico customers to RKT), Berkadia(multi-family/commercial lending which RKT doesn't handle), Berkshire Hathaway Automotive(sells cars, but doesn't handle direct financing, but RKT Auto does), Cavalier and Clayton homes(new homes which can be passed to RKT to increase sales there), and finally Home Services(realtor group).

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Leave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Continental Automotive has a lot of potential for a long term play (if I knew how to do emojis I would put them here) This is my first DD, and I'm a bit of a smooth brain so go easy on me.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

Their solution is literally the TOP and first to be easily available to start .

HYLN is working for the future, has the first mover advantage on it's field, NKLA is a scam and Tesla is not good for long mileage. Tesla I see covering the short distance of a few hundreds while HYLN solution will cover the need of trucking.


If you are still bear about HYLN , well, NKLA is triple the evaluation and is a much bigger scam team than HYLN.


Their last news put them back on map and people who like long bets should like HYLN.

The tits pattern is shaping up nicely.

Using nerds lingo, it could be a double cup and handle and not just a double bottom as previously suggested.

For the pattern to be confirmed, we shouldn't have any drops below $49. A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.

- Tops and bottoms

Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.

But guys, we're making higher lows. That's big.

They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.

Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That's our short term goal.

Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.

- History repeating itself

It looks like we're losing, but we're not.

When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.

Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what's happening right now.

Currently holding with high hopes for Q4 ER in late March. Cohen hasn't revealed any of his tricks in his sleeve since he's revolutionised the board.

I like the stock 💎🙌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ZOM 's smart play It has been accurately pointed out that Zomedica is wildly overvalued for what it does. The total market for its only current product is worth less than the current company valuation.

What caught my attention was the very interesting move they pulled when their stock exploded. They dumped 91 million fresh shares into the market, blunting the still massive surge in stock price and capturing a huge windfall in the process. Now they're sitting on over $180 million dollars in cash to fund R&D and diversify with.

To me this looks like they are positioned to diversify their products and expand well out of their initial niche, unless they pocket it all in the form of bonus checks and run. It makes me think that we're just waiting for them to announce that they're working on a new a product in a bigger market and they'll go nuts again.

What do the big brains here think?

**Disclaimer**: I don't know things and lose money when I try to make tendies.

Here's why: Ozempic


If anyone in your house has Boomer cable news, then the commercial jingle would be familiar to you. (Oh-oh-oh-Ozempic-oh-oh). It's a diabetes drug that's about to explode in value later this year.


For anyone who doesn't know how drug regulation works, clinical trials are needed before the FDA will approve a drug as being safe and effective for a given indication. 


Currently Ozempic has been approved for diabetes only. Their current commercials mention that you "may" lose weight on the drug. They can't advertise that you "will definitely lose weight", because the FDA hasn't approved it for that specific indication... yet.


On Wednesday Novo Nordisk released information that their post marketing clinical trial of Ozempic proved that it could help you achieve weight loss at an average rate of around 15kg (~30 pounds) per year without a change in diet or lifestyle. Once they submit this data to the FDA, Novo will have the world's first "thin pill", and they can start marketing it to young women instead of just diabetic Boomers.


Of course the catch is that if you stop taking it, the weight comes back, so you have to be a customer for life... or change your lifestyle.


When the news came out on Wednesday the stock jumped $2 immediately and has been rising since. I watched it for a day thinking it might decline, but no such luck, it's going steadily up. It's a Boomer stock so low risk/low reward for now, but if this drug can be approved this year (looking likely), then it'll be great for their earnings. I think it'll be the next Viagra.


Not financial or investment advice. 
I'm just a dumb monkey that licks windows and knows that America has an epidemic of obesity and many of them have health insurance plans they can charge the drug to instead of paying for it themselves.

Disclosure: this was all taken and edited from u/krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it - also I’m not an investment advisor 

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings, fixing up their house or repair negotiations, buyer’s demands, doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama, have to deal with realtors, or even pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%) Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.
Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could be valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market. As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**CONCERNS:**

**WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Assets. This simply can't happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

**WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**ISN’T THIS JUST UBER FOR HOUSES**

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash, Uber, etc... 

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

I bought 1 GME at 50$, and I'm holding. I also wanted to ask about GME business debt of 219$ million. I saw a report that Gamestop didn't file their (notice of earnings)? to their shareholders, so GME couldn't sell their shares of the company to pay off their own debts, which they probably could have because they filed to sell off $100 million of their shares with IRS.

So, if we hold long enough, and do xyz. could we profit, and GME pay their debts off at some point this year? Or, is that a shot in the dark because we don't know what GME plans to do?

Did you miss the MU boat?

You don't want to buy AMD because WSB keeps saying to and this shit's cursed?

# tl;dr - $FORM

***Who the fuck?***

$FORM is a midcap company providing testing solutions for **semiconductor manufacturers**.They offer both products and services to test a variety of semiconductor products, including **cryogenic test equipment** for shit like quantum computing.

The semiconductor shortage is going to be around for a while and there's no one solution which will somehow fix it in one fell swoop.

So manufacturers need testing solutions if they are going to ramp up production.

***"Why should I know them?"***

You're not supposed to know, they aren't providing their services to YOU.  They are providing it to companies who make the damn semiconductors.

They held their IPO in 2003, since then they snapped up a bunch of smaller companies. MicroProbe, Cascade Microtech, FRT and ATT GMBH...

***"That doesn't mean anything to me, why should I spend my allowance on them?"***

I know this will piss you off but it's just good numbers in an industry with bonkers demand:

* Earnings Growth of 120.48% over the past 12 months
* Debt is 2% of their capital, with a YOY debt reduction of 16.13%
* Market Cap $3.84B, total annual revenue 2019 was $589mm, 2020 was $693MM gross profit margin of 41.5%.
* Doubled net income from 2019-2020.  Net income per share ALSO DOUBLED (no dilution)
* 89.56% institutional ownership with increasing positions each year.
* EPS has beaten the consensus forecast in every quarter since q2 2020.
* Last loss-making year was 2016.

***"But this website says they are overvalued!"***

Yes you fucking idiot. Of course they do.  All the numbers in a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation are based on a calculation of 0-5% annual growth linked to a company's debt.

They've already HAD 15% GROWTH YOY without a SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE and REDUCED THEIR DEBT.

I think that this is an unsexy company in an unsexy industry with a future that is giving me a real 💎🍆They closed at 46.58 on Wednesday, 48.24 on Thursday, 50.00 as I write this.

Tell me if this seems familiar:

“Yo XXXX is 🚀🚀🚀 load up before it’s too late”

This is the essence of stocktwits, people loading up their bags and then pumping them to others without any catalyst or autistic insight.

First of all, nobody would advertise their positions if shit is good because you want to load up before the cost basis goes up. Look up DFV posts on when Burry went public with his GME long, he exclaimed how it increased his cost basis.

So then the only valid reason to post those stupid pump posts is to eventually dump it on the last guy that’s stupid enough to buy in.

Nothing autistic about that, it’s lazy and it’s toxic.

So far so good._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 1) 🚀🚀🚀 I will be writing a series of DD posts for OSK. I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.

Oshkosh’s Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.

Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire & emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.

The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didn’t facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom). 

During Wilson’s tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isn’t just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you can’t do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))

Wilson and the OSK team aren’t satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wife’s boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.

The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.

In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didn’t plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

Positions: OSK (4/16 $115 Call & 4/16 $125 Call), ELY, SBUX, T, GME_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

And again...

**BlackBerry’s Market Cap: $7.3B**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

So, you retards are telling me to sell my undervalued stock to buy *OVERVALUED* stock?! LMAOOO 💎🙌🏻🚀

EDIT 3: Position is 500 shares @ $20.35, and no, I did not make this post to “recover losses.” Please, if you are a cynic, do yourself a favor and realize that not everyone is cynical._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL Please put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.

Of course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.

I'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.

Fair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...

Here are some reasons:

**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**

I won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the "next" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump & Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.

If you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy and walk away with cash and hand.

**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**

Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.

A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \[1\]

1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)
2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.
3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \[2\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.

**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**

This is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.

This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \[3\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.

**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**

If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.

Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \[4\].

This is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.

**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)

Some guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 25,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\[redacted company name\]**,**\[redacted company name\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.

**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**

It's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can turn **$20 million cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.

However they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.

I'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say "Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.

**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**

The institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.

Instead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**

By the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Showing really large capital on their filings (which actually disappear the day after) would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. It's no wonder why a small company with 90% of their capital lost would want their financials looking a bit crisper on their sec filings.

**H. MAGIC NUMBER**

If all of this is lost on you, at least realize that they potentially have a $690 million deficit if my math is right.

69

What else do you need?

EDIT: I don't have any positions in the company expiring today, nor do I think them staying on will stop the inevitability of my position making money. I could exit it now at a profit if I wanted to. It's a principled matter at this point, and more of a warning about some misinformation I've seen posted here regarding their financials. Just check the sec filings if you want to make your own decision. Don't trust what I say, trust the facts.

In the picture attached, you can clearly see that $5C for SNDL randomly bounced up in price midday on January 27th, two days before a registered offering.

For the amount of patents it holds to new technology (2,000 patents alone just related to 5g) and for how big of a player it is in the 5g sector... why is its market cap so low (market cap of 23.99B with about 5B outstanding shares putting the price per share at 4.10)?

To put this into perspective there are 3 players in the 5g scene: Ericsson ($ERIC), Huawei (Private chinese company), and Nokia ($NOK). The US government isnt really allowing Huawei into the 5g scene on US soil so that really only leaves two companies... not three. That being said i believe Nokia is undervalued and im confused as to why it's at where it is... just an opinion but I think market cap should be atleast double of what it is now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME + AMC + SPCE Gains - Not What You Think!

I understand that I may get bashed or called a boomer for this, but I would like to discuss the possibility of oil stocks making a recovery this summer. While the popular consensus is that clean energy is taking over (Teslas on the road, Amazon using electric trucks, fuel economy improvements, federal EV mandates, pipelines being banned, etc.), and I agree with this consensus long term (by 2030), I don't think oil is going anywhere in the short term.

Back in early November 2020, oil stocks started climbing their way back to their pre-covid averages, but most have not reached their pre-covid averages and some have almost 50% more to grow (such as Suncor or British Petroleum). My thought process is that with Covid vaccines rolling out/restrictions letting up, we will see increases in summer travel and an increase in manufacturing (which often requires oil). This paired with climbing oil prices will bring an increase in oil stocks in my opinion.

For a well thought out bull/bear thesis on oil see this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lhwmhu/the_bull_bear_case_for_oil/

As of now, it looks like summer calls or 2022/2023 leaps on oil stocks are pretty cheap. 

What do you guys think? Will oil stocks rebound to pre-covid averages this summer or not?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Carvana Ooh Na-Na: The WeWork of Used Automobiles Profile:

We're here to talk about Carvana. You probably heard of it and your friend Jeff who recently bought his Subie WRX off Carvana won't stop telling all his friends how seamless the process was. For those who don't know;  Carvana performs almost all the functions a physical dealer would offer: buying and selling cars, accepting trade-ins, and financing purchases except they're strictly an online-only used-car retailer. With so many online used car e-commerce choices and alternatives; Carvana's advantage is that they make their process as contactless as possible and they take away the hassle of haggling with a sleazy salesman. Carvana does not allow their customers to test drive the vehicle before they purchase but they do offer a 7 day return policy for any reason with some caveats. Carvana will deliver your purchase for free if you're within 75 miles of its physical location or they will charge you anywhere from $250-$1000 by a 3rd party delivery company. One of their gimmick is that they have physical car vending kiosks in 24 locations where customers can use a token to pick up their car like one of those old gumball machines you used to see as a kid.

Valuation:

[Stock Price](https://preview.redd.it/b3tidam2vzg61.jpg?width=1519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18c57488f752cb434aa9a73b3dde77d57cfbf9b8)

CVNA was trading about $80-$100 a share pre-covid and reached as low as $22 during the peak of the pandemic. CVNA IS now trading at its ATH hovering around $290-$300 a share. They have a market cap of $49.74B which is bigger than notable online e-commerce giants such as $CHWY($43B), $EBAY($42B), $W($29B), $KMX($20B) and $ETSY($27B). Carvana have been consistently losing money and have yet to turn a profitable quarter. They lose approximately $1500 on every car sold last year, taking overhead costs into account. The company is being evaluated like a Tech SAAS company but it's really a WeWork for cars.

[Financials](https://preview.redd.it/wks9vxvyuzg61.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd4168d9a3cb6e2cd32b0a3588d5f8a54d61b1c6)

Economy:

You might've already heard that used car prices have been going up due to the constraints of manufacturers producing new cars coupled along with people having extra money from not going on vacation and also the additional income from the government's stimulus checks. This means Carvana is making a higher premium when they sell but they're also paying a lot more to attain inventory. The purchased cars will sit in inventory and will get continuously markdown until they are sold. In order to make space, Carvana will even sell at narrow to negative margins just to keep churning through inventory. With the influx of demand, it is impossible for quality control and customer service to keep up with the momentum of increasing sales. Take a look at their BBB rating of 1.4/5 with 882/1385 complaints coming from the past year. Tech companies are allowing their employees to work from home and cars are becoming less of a necessity unless you're in the suburbs. Chances are if you're looking for a car, you'll wait for the market prices to come back to normal and continue to use your ol faithful 2011 Honda accord or 2012 Ford Focus as there is really no rush with sheltering in place still in effect.

Shady Practice:

Carvana is family owned and is being run by Ernest Garcia II and his son Ernest Garcia III. Ernest Garcia II is the majority stake holder of Carvana and played a part as a straw borrower in a real estate scandal back in 1990 with Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loans. He is also the owner and chairman of DriveTime which is a company that specializes in selling used vehicles with their demographic being  customers who can only afford cars with sub-prime loans. Ernest then went to start Carvana as a subsidiary of Drive Time which is basically Drive Time but for millennial and gen z because who doesn't want to pick up their vehicle from a vending machine right? Carvana is not a used car marketplace, its a bank that preys on unexpecting victims by deceiving them into loans they cannot afford. The Garcias were also sued for insider trading when CVNA stock was trading at its low in the height of the pandemic. Stock prices fell during Covid and they took advantage of the artificial stock price and offered shares for sales to their private investors even though they were not in dire need for money.  The Garcias knew the stock would rebound as they have full disclosure of the health and financials of the company, and were not facing a liquidity issue of any sort. Fast forward to now with CVNA sitting its ATH, Ernest Garcia II have been dumping his shares starting at the end of October and have been steadily offloading over 2 billion dollars worth of shares.

&#x200B;

[Recent Insider Trades](https://preview.redd.it/y4b1u9q4g2h61.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8e648e3b4c4e09a825b075452004a96f8306ef1)

TLDR; CVNA is a shady bank disguised in the form of a used car e-commerce. The owner have a history of engaging in white collar crimes. The company have not been profitable but they obtain an absurd evaluation compared to their peers. Take a look at insider trading and you can see that the owner have been dumping his shares.

Summation:

Buy your Puts for its upcoming earnings or whatever date you feel comfortable but beware this POS stock is being backed by the likes of Wells Fargo and Citi Group for those juicy sub prime loans and who knows who else the Garcias have on their payroll. I didn't even get into the topic of their competitors such as KMX, VRM, Lotz but yeah do your own research instead of listening to some stranger on the internet. Peace.

Edit: Ernest Garcia III sold 6.8 Mill shares since the end of Oct and coincidentally he filed his form 13G today and it states he has 16 Mill shares outstanding which is 18% of CVNA shares. That means he dumped about 30% of his position since the end of October.

Sector is booming strongly for a few months and is expected to go higher for the next few more. Dry bulk companies were severely undervalued due to periods of long depression the last few years.

Just today Diana had a 25% spike. Safe Bulkers a 12% and Star Bulk 15%. I expect this to go quite a bit higher. A couple days ago Castor had its day in the sun with a staggering spike, but these companies here are even better value, as they are well established, well managed and with large fleets.

Now keep in mind it is a volatile sector and some dry bulk stocks have been prone to manipulation before, so do your own research.

(TSLA Yolo/DD/Bet) I am god damn sick and god damn tired of all these pathetic newbies coming on here and taking away from the authentic WSB culture. Backing out of bets, selling after a dip, saying that we should actually do research before throwing our life savings into a play? It's fucking pathetic, disgraceful. I can hardly even fucking look at you half the time, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.

Every day we stray further from god. What actually brought us to this point? What gave all these degenerates enough capital to lose 10x their inital investment on margin? What first united us as a clan when all the hedgies and stonk brokers said we were going down? What was there before PLTR, GME, SNDL or AMC? Tslsa, Tsla, Tsla, and Tsla. Tesla is the primordial ooze that binds us retards together on the eternal path to tendie town.

There is no in-between, this is the way. Now for the three-for-one:

# Due Diligence

Tesla literally can not go down next week. It is physically impossible to stray below it's current price point. The timeless syllogism of Tesla is known as modus ponens

Proposition 1: Stonks only go up

Proposition 2: Tsla is a stonk

Conclusion: Tsla only goes up, QED.

I know I've said it before but this literally cannot go tits up. It's like getting in at Gourds before they were a big hit. It's like that one dude who bought a lot of tranches or whatever the fuck before we knew about tranches. It's foolproof. ***Huge upside potential with very little downside. Does that ring a bell?”***

# Bet

If Tesla closes Friday above $900 I will be getting a Tesla tattoo on my ass cheek.

If Tesla closes Friday above $1000, that tattoo will be the size of a small watermelon.

Don't you dare even insult me by even asking if I'm going to follow through, I am. I'm not like these pussies who fake their bets harder than their wives fake their orgasms. You bet your sweet ass I will follow through.

First off, I’m holding 420 shares of AMD. Yesterday Biden said he wants to do something to help bring some manufacturing back to the states and this could be AMDs chance to get involved. 

AMD currently has the fastest chips and outsources production to TSM. AMD producing their own chips is not something that’s going to happen overnight so I wouldn’t call it a yolo play, but they certainly have a lot to gain here. 

NVDA and INTC could potentially gain from this as well, but I felt that AMD has the most to gain with their recent supply issues.

This is my first write up I’ll be doing, I know that this account is new but I have never bothered to hop on reddit until recently. My goal with this is to shed light on PLTR’s current situation and the likely bounce back it’ll have soon. Please forgive any ape like sentence structuring, I haven’t had my daily crayon. 

Firstly let’s talk about why PLTR is plummeting right now, the potential it has going forward and why buying now is probably one of the last chances with entry at a heavy discount.

Some useful notes (all of these values are intra-day and were grabbed as of writing time, they may have changed):

*Current price: $31.99

*Lowest point this week was today: $31.99

*Highest point this week: $39.15

*Highest point all time: $44.45

Currently PLTR has been dropping HARD in value from the recent highs it hit and somehow the bleeding hasn’t stopped. People have been shorting and selling this stock left and right out of panic that the earnings, long weekend and the lockout will cause a major dip in the price. We all know how the markets work, panic and sell first, think second. Now, here’s why the long term benefits outweigh the short term panic.

PLTR has such a unique offering compared to some of the stocks “booming” right now and we already know when they receive new partnerships the price peaks above $38+. The lowest point has been hit now, the stock likely will spike if earnings are good even if it does not immediately, we can expect another partnership to make the price boom.

It’s also worth noting analysts that aren’t as stupid as me are setting the price target to at-least $40-55. There’s also articles speculating the earnings will be better then the previous quarter report. 

All in all please do your own DD and research before blinding trusting me.

Link to article speculating earnings will be fine/better:
https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/palantirs-pltr-top-line-shape-132101801.html

I truly believe anyone investing and holding now will see HUGE reward coming into next week or the week after.

My position:
PLTR/29 units at $32.02.

Thanks for coming to my ape talk.

EDIT: To anyone asking about my new account I can’t reply in the comments due to auto mod. So I’ll leave this notice here for now, I joined Reddit after WSB blew up after GME. I wanted to remain anonymous so that’s why my name is so generic. I only expected to lurk but I couldn’t help myself.

EDIT 2: Someone asked why I only have 29 shares, it’s called being broke. Trust me if I had the money I would be investing more into this.

EDIT 3: My thoughts on the lockup expiry detailed: Since the lockup expires 3 days after the earnings report there will likely still be a jump in price right after earnings before preemptively dropping again. Likely some institutes will sell for profits but I doubt many will following a -15% week. The price will climb shortly after panic settles!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Gains.

Started in November with $4,500 that I cash advanced from my credit card and saved by paying my rent with that card for 2 months. I initially bought 75% shares and 25% calls and just pressed buttons on my phone a few times here and then for the next couple months. I didn't want to post this until GME wounds started healing for others. I did, however, go down with the ship in my Fidelity where I lost about 25k on shares. Nothing I did was smart, I got lucky. DON'T FUCKING GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. THERE WAS 1 SPOT IN 10 MILLION WHERE THAT SHIT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I ALREADY TOOK IT. Please don't test your luck because you will lose your shirt and your wife will go stay with her boyfriend permanently. Otherwise, keep those Wendie's Tendies flowing you fucking retards.

Edit 1: Getting a lot of PM's asking for money. Bitch, I'd love to help everybody and will be making sizeable donation to charities and bringing video games to kids for Christmas. However, I don't just have cash everywhere. I actually adjusted my quality of life DOWNWARDS. Also, if you wanna PM me to ask where to learn about options, you better have some experience in business, logistics, trucking or brokering freight, so you can return the favor. I need help with something so tit for tat.

Edit 2: Got a lot of people messaging me asking about what shall not be named i.e. rule 4. If you are interested in that, you can go through my post history.

Edit 3: Can't I get a flair or something for being an absolute retard?

Edit 4: Yes people, this was my FIRST play in the stock market, I'm not a guru that could do this again. The first's one's always free or at least it was in my case! I am lucky, not skilled.

Edit 5: The week of the gamma squeeze, I was up to 90k. I pulled out 46k which was more than 10 times my initial investment. Had I not done that, I would not have had the balls to make this play. My best advice, **SET YOURSELF UP FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN PLAY RISKY LIKE THIS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE STILL BETTER OFF THEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED!!!**

Edit 6: Volatility. How did I not wanna die with such large fluctuations? Well sometimes I did, that's what the liquor was for. Otherwise, as you can probably tell, I was born in the bytecorn space but way out of even the top 25 or 100 corns. I'm talking microcap that would put even the worst copperstonks to shame. This volatility pales in comparison and I became comfortable there, sometimes even happy. Learn to hold onto your pants trading the most volatile asset known to man, and options will be a walk in the park.  Also, I learned a ton about greed and chasing gains in the pop of 2017.

Apologies to the Mods if it's not acceptably thorough. And wow! Thank you for the awards, my first on Reddit!

I've been invested in Palantir since it DPO'd last year, originally bought in at just below the $10 mark, and made some good money in a couple of accounts after its first run up. I'm convinced the stock is going to hit $100 at some point (obviously I hope it'll be this year, but as a long term play, it doesn't matter too much).

I've been keeping an eye on the institutional ownership of Palantir here: [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr)

At the end of last year, there were about 193 institutional investors holding shares of Palantir, for a total of 12.39% of the float. During January, the number of institutions steadily increased, but the percentage that they held really didn't go up that much. It wasn't until February that institutional ownership passed the 13% mark.

Today, we're at 371 institutional owners (344 yesterday), and the institutional ownership has shot up past 18%.

Earnings for $PLTR is Tuesday before market open (note: the market is closed on Monday, so today's the last day before earnings if you're waiting to jump in). A lot of people tend to sell in the run up to earnings, as the hype is a good opportunity to take profits. What I'm seeing today is that the institutions are basically buying the dip. They missed their chance to take advantage of a crazy IPO, but they're not going to miss the chance to make money off a company that is most likely going to fly in the next 12 months.

This year has seen positive news every week for Palantir, and I think that even if the earnings report itself isn't amazing, the guidance for the year ahead is going to make the stock fly.

[Original YOLO Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg3qns/amd_105k_yolo/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SUBZ Is anyone else going in on this ETF that opened 2 days ago?

ETFs are generally safer/slower, but Roundhill’s other ones (BETZ; NERD; DEEP) all went up 100+% over the year, starting around where SUBZ is now. I’m also a fan of Netflix and while I think streaming might slow down as things open back up, I think people have become accustomed to them, and that people overestimate the desire to go back to watching movies in person rather than from the comfort of a couch, or in a friend’s living room. 

I don’t know shit, but this seems like a decent ETF to get into now and watch it slowly double over the course of the year, so you have a safe slow burn account to hedge your bets against.

Obviously I went in on this one and am biased and want it to go up, but I don’t think it can be as subject to pump and dumps or volatility because it’s an ETF and it would take mountains to move it, IMO_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood Market Sold my Stock without Me Knowing Today.. Until I got text Alerts about it I know many have posted similar issues. I wanted to list inform and detail my case here too. We should all make sure we make a web posting if it happens too, well I am now anyway.  


I received  four text alerts telling me my sell orders for AMC and GME were cancelled and my order for KOSS was filled. 

I did not put in a market sell order for KOSS today, Robinhood did and at  $14.65 per share... I bought them the day limits happens at  41.99 & 44.00 in protest. I had no intention of selling these, let alone at such a low price.  


I did have GTC sell order set for AMC & GME each 1 share, at 16 & 483 because I felt those were what they were worth when i set them and left them. I also paid 13.03 & 296 for the shares. Again I bought these on the day restrictions happened on purpose in protest.  


What they have done and are doing is fraud and illegal. If we all stay silent and take it, nothing will happen. Those who continue to tell the tale and hold the share they have to make a point, can. I and we may never see  true justice or fair returns, but I will not just be robbed in broad daylight without a fight.

That said here’s why GEVO is nice and I’m holding it for the long term.

GEVO are going to be making carbon neutral jet fuel. Pretty nifty coz I’m pretty sure people are already paying extra to airlines to fly lower carbon flights, and I’m sure governments all around the world will be heavily incentivising low carbon footprint fuels.

They’ve secured funding now for their Net-Zero 1 project which will use entirely renewable energy sources to refine 45MGPY of bio-fuels which have a net zero carbon footprint. They already have in place contracts to sell 48MGPY at 1.5 billion over the life of the contracts. After this they’re looking to introduce projects net zero 2 and 3 as well as a bunch of other cool, useful shit that lets us revolutionise the world without reinventing planes and shit.

Goldman Sachs was the investment bank that advised UNFI to acquire SuperValue.

On October 20, 2018 Goldman Sachs lowers its rating on UNFI to 'SELL' after the acquisition was complete. Why would Goldman Sachs lower its rating on a company they just advised. If the SuperValue deal was good for UNFI (per Goldman's advice) shouldn't this mean a positive outlook for the stock?

[UNFI Analyst Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/zg6i8c3jv2h61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=87512c5f83f33b8f940e91ebe71b6bd48e9f681e)

In 2019, [UNFI filed a multi-count lawsuit](https://unfilitigationfacts.com/case-overview/) against Goldman Sachs to recover damages and recoup ill-gotten gains stemming from its improper conduct during the period in which it advised UNFI on the $2.9 billion acquisition of SuperValue.

[UNFI Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/sgkc0aify2h61.png?width=1603&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7677735a71bb9849cdb90b6824f4516d92dc77d)

Goldman Sachs used its market power and influence to exploit UNFI as part of a concerted effort to maximize the Bank’s profits.

UNFI asserted that Goldman Sachs made material misrepresentations and omissions of fact to induce the Company to accept their demand that SuperValue be added as a co-borrower on the Term Loan. They told UNFI that the impact would be minimal. But the truth is that the effect of adding SuperValue as a co-borrower caused significant harm to UNFI because the change was part of an unlawful *quid pro quo* between the Bank and credit default swap holders to solidify their participation in the Term Loan. The co-borrower adjustment spurred an artificial and significant spike in the value of CDS protection contracts held by the Bank’s hedge fund clients.

If this is not market manipulation, I don't know what is. And you guys thought Melvin was bad...

**TL;DR** Goldman fucked UNFI, lowered their rating to sell, the stock is not trading at fair value due to manipulation.

Options start trading 3 days after IPO, so with the holiday it's this coming Tuesday 2/16 

*Edit: the meme strike will be $69p 4/20. JK, the chain at single dollars and that date don't exist, so I think $60p June is fine.* 

**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)

* Total Revenue of $376.6 million
* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million
* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million
* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%
* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million
* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million

We can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin >20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x.

**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits.

That speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think "oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber."

**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be.

**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival.

Also, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies. She always gives me the tendies, and sometimes I give one back to her in return._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "I'm gonna pretend you a man. A very beautiful man with a great body that I'd like to take to the movies" - James Carter _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The future of semiconductors and why Intel is poised to win the war While you incestuous smooth brained degenerates have been getting fiddled by wall street, always late to plays, "hodling" (this is fucking retarded) literal trash like weed stonks GME and feeding overvalued tech companies that never turned a profit. While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

Enjoy,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Insider Trading Question - Friend Works at a Company that is in the News My friend works at a private company that is in the news of a possible acquisition by a public company. He asked me for advice and now I am here. Legal at his job put out a post basically saying that the news is all rumors and is nothing official, but at the bottom of the post in bold letters made almost like a warning that the SEC is very strict on insider trading, and warned people against trading this stock.

So if legal of your company is saying its a rumor, then how would that be considered insider trading if you invest in a company you don't work for that rumor has it is buying your company?

One account is with Robinhood (I know, I know, but I'm waiting on options approval with my Fidelity brokerage account) and one account is a Fidelity Traditional IRA where I already have options enabled. I've started by buying these contracts on RH and have been paying an average of .14 or even .15 just to get filled. I've had a few .13 filled, but the bid in the quote below are my 7 for my Robinhood account. I'm very eager to buy these contracts, so while I wait for that to fill, I started buying on Fidelity in my IRA. As you can see, I bought 91 contracts where I put in a limit order for .15, and Fidelity was able to get them filled at .13. ALL WHILE MY .13 ROBINHOOD ORDER ISN'T FILLING.

I paid $.65 in commission for Fidelity but they are filling, where as I'd have to move my Robinhood order up to .14 or .15 just to fill, costing even more than the Fidelity commission. Holy shit, here's the proof of just how terrible we're all getting fucked by Robinhood. It's been 10 minutes and I'm still waiting on RH to fill. This is unbelievable.

$TRVG is now back above $1bn market cap. It was worth nearly 3x as much a year ago.

Expedia is the majority shareholder in the company, so it's definitely not going to disappear.

This quarter the company announced that they managed to cut expenses by 71% versus 2019, bringing their overall cash burn down to about 10 million dollars.

They're sitting on about 250-300 million in cash on hand, so that's enough for them to last **5 years** with out having to grow sales at all. 🚀🚀🚀

They're a MUCH leaner business than they were coming into the pandemic, and they'll be primed to benefit once sales start to increase coming out of this. 🚀🚀🚀

They aren't an Airline with billions of dollars in planes sitting on the ground, so they'll be able to pivot into profitability very quickly. 🚀🚀🚀

The "Worst case" scenario here is that Expedia buys out the remaining shares. If this were to happen, they won't be buying them back for less than 6-8$.

Shares have been trending upwards since they announced earnings earlier this week.

Call premiums are pricing in IV of 200%+, so this is definitely a play where you buy shares.

At the current valuation, we're getting to buy a company that normally generates a billion dollars in revenues for a cash adjusted price of $800 mil

Even more beautiful, the majority of their revenues were previously generated by companies Expedia owns. Booking holdings (Expedia's competitor) has been increasing the amount of business they've been sending to Trivago and as a % of business, Booking holdings has been referring more in 2020 vs 2019.

Liability note: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD. This is a stock I like a LOT

TLDR: Trivago's biggest client is Expedia group, Trivago's biggest shareholder is Expedia. Booking holdings, Expedia's competitor has been sending $TRVG more business. Costs are down 71% year over year, so a "new" leaner company coming out of the pandemic, with LOTS of pent-up travel demand. Shares are cheap, but won't be for long. In the time I typed this up, they rose from $2.80 to just under 3$.

Position: 16 000 shares, 20x 5$ march calls, 10x April 5$ calls 50x July 5$ calls.

I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB) Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.

Mattress King._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PALANTIR 9,000 SHARES YOLO UPDATE _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pre-NASDAQ listing play on US Cannabis Industries. If you're just now getting into weed stocks be aware, there massive untapped potential in US companies currently traded on the OTC market. With the SAFE/MORE act currently getting passes in congress and Schumer making moves towards legalization, US MSOs are getting closer than ever to being listed on NASDAQ and when institutional investors have access to the US cannabis industry... All hell breaks loose. The largest names right now are Green Thumb, Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Cresco Labs. No need to get smoked gambling on Canadian Cannabis companies, US MSOs have a huge advantage and are already established across the country for the moment legalization comes. I'm passing yall the boof on this one. Do with this information what you will. I currently have positions in Green Thumb and Curaleaf.

edit: If you're stuck with a shit broker and don't have access to OTC market and you can still profit off US MSOs with the ETF (MSOS)!

tl;dr: US cannabis companies are on a massive discount on the OTC market, massive potential gains when they get listed on NASDAQ

Edit: Cathie Wood has a ton of this in ARK ETFs already

I’m a Realtor in one of the test markets for Opendoor (Charlotte) and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far.  They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry.

A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence: I have been a licensee since early 2013. My husband is real estate closing attorney . His office handles 300+ real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18-20 full-time employees.

My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney. Back in 2010 – 2015, his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense. He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system, helping them apply for and obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender. Back then, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses. They simply couldn’t sell them and move on. They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house. The fed bailed out the banks  by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out, but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long, complicated and very difficult. As a Realtor, I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales. During the markets in 2008-2014, this was a huge majority of houses.  Around 2015, the scales tipped back and the market, for the most part, was nearly recovered. Currently, there are no short sales. VERY rare, if so.

Currently, the market in Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand. I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table. It is common for most houses to get 20+ offers within hours of listing. It’s an absolute bloodbath out there.

To say that I understand this industry is an understatement. I know it in and out, up and down, left and right. I eat, sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time.

iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased. I am seeing it happen here now, in real time. So, let me explain…

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet  has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads. It’s ironic, but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

You take a lot of Xanax in this industry….

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings. Seller doesn’t have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations. Seller doesn’t have to hear about the buyer’s demands. Seller doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama. Seller doesn’t have to deal with Realtors. Seller doesn’t have to pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%). Seller is in control. Seller has total power of the transaction. Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.

Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule. No working around some Realtor’s schedule. The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “ If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “ Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

Now is the time where I recommend you move over to Opendoor.com and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly. You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate. Yes, even for the retards on this sub.

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market.  As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings (NOT my husband) scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG! wE aRe In A bUbBlE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Asaets. This simply can't happen anymore are at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

Sidenote: I bought a foreclosure and the prior owner took out 3 cash out refis in 2007 within the same week. He didn't tell the lenders about one another at all. There was NO underwriting process that would have caught this at the time. The guy took all the cash and used it to buy a horse ranch in the same city. He never made a payment to any of the 3 lenders and knew it would go to foreclosure. He didn't care because he won. He beat the system, and you know what? He got away with it. Because he was one of thousands just like him who did the exact same thing and the banks realized it would be cheaper to eat it than fight it through the court systems and try to collect against most people who had no assets. This was 2008. 
This will never be possible again.

**wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs????**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA, bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr.**

No, owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars.

**Cars are a depreciating asset.**

**Real estate is an appreciating asset.**

95% of millionaires are made with owning real estate, myself included.

Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods. Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank.

Of course there are exceptions to everything. People are able to sell their house after owning it for 30 years and make retirement level money. People retire off their equity. You can't sell your daily driver after using it for 10 years and make the equivalent rate of return. Appreciating vs depreciating. Of course exceptions exist like Condos in RE and rare classic cars. But for the most part, in 99% situations, real estate gains value while personal property loses it. This is economics 101.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

My Response:

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs:**

No, it’s not. Uber has zero assets. They don’t own a single car.

They have nothing but their systems and software.

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash, Airbnb, etc.

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.


Okay, I think I’m going to wrap this up. I’m sure Ill think of more stuff and will add to it later but I have to get some work done.

I was drafting this DD up to put in my private archives, but this place isn't autistic enough anymore. Apes are too alpha with their diamond hands and I'm here to bring you some plays to put tendies on the table like good ol days.

I'm here to talk about what's for some reason an under followed stock. **[$SE](https://i.imgur.com/dkHcLZk.png)** 


**BUT WHAT IS $SE?!?!?!?**
Sea Limited is a leading E-commerce, digital payments, and mobile gaming company based in Southeast Asia NOT COMMIE TOWN CHINA (disclaimer I'm long $BABA). They operate through those three segments and benefit from synergies between them.

Let's start with **E-commerce**
It's the middle of a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I bet your house is filled with cardboard boxes up to the ceilings. At least mine is. I'm buying a lot of shit online, because I'm working from home, trading in my PJs and making FAT STACKS off $SE. While I don't live in Malaysia, I use Amazon. It's the future. Look at the entire brick and mortar retail industry over the last 5-10 years *cough* GME *cough*. Things aren't so hot. You can get things cheaper and exactly what you want.

*I feel this part of the thesis is pretty self explanatory. Do you believe people will continue to buy things online over the next 10 years?* 

* Yes -> buy $SE 
* No -> Go buy GME lol

But how are they doing? FUCKING GREAT. I have access to some proprietary app data I'm too lazy to smuggle off my work PC, but let me say. Things are UP. Downloads, DAU, session length, all the metrics. BOOMIN. Don't believe me? Here's how they've been doing vs. local competitors ($BABA owned Lazada) and a private company rumored to be involved with a one of those special purpose tickers (Tokopedia).

**$SE** mainly competes in its e-commerce segment in the Southeast Asia market. It's key countries are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. 
As shown here using google trends, we see that Shopee is now claiming the top spot in relative search interest in many of these markets.

[Current Growth Rates](https://i.imgur.com/3m1OtVS.png)

**Digital Payments.** $SE also has a digital wallet app. This is Southeast Asia. They don't have JP Morgan pulling from everyone's pockets. Everyone's got a phone and uses this in tandem to purchase things online. Did I mention that $SE has both B2C and C2C shopping apps? Want to transact with local business? Process payments and handle your small business checking through $SE. Makes it easy to track and receive payments from customers. Fucking great. Basically lets the company pull a sliver from every transaction going on in their markets.

[Not a compelling YOLO worthy investment on it's own but bolsters the package, just like how stuffing a sock bolsters my cock.](https://i.imgur.com/ogvlJ17.png)



**Mobile Gaming.** What's that? Boom Beach is for dads? I know. Doesn't matter, the rest of the world loves this shit. Their mobile gaming division is called Garena and their biggest game is a battle royale called Free Fire:

 >Garena is a leading esports organizer. It hosts esports events around the world that range from grassroots local tournaments to some of the most viewed professional esports competitions globally. Garena’s largest global esports tournament of 2019, the Free Fire World Series, achieved over 130 million cumulative online views.

[Somehow, this shit fills stadiums.](https://i.imgur.com/QLDDvbz.png)

[And growth don't stop.](https://i.imgur.com/m6BjdsO.png)


Why it's interesting? Recent IPO (relatively). This thing is less than 2 years public and absolutely on a tear. Market cap of $140 billion is especially compelling. Consider that the [e-commerce growth is the fastest in the world in their markets.](https://i.imgur.com/wgSi5qQ.png).

It's a company you value on the top-line. So in a region with 8-10% GDP growth, and 10%+ ecommerce growth it's easy to make a case for 20% top-line growth on right there. Now lets consider an increasing shift in spend from brick and mortar to digital of 10% (you make 1 out of 10 purchases online more than you did last year) and gaining market share. 50% growth isn't hard to achieve on this piece of the business alone. And that's ANNUAL. 

How to play it? LEAPS. Shares are for apes and frees up cash for FDs on pull backs (if it drops more than 10% hammer the ask on all the 20% OTM 60 DTE you can get).

This isn't financial advice, I like this stock!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ More CNBC lies.. And its not that I myself traded on their information at all.  It just bothers me they keep making shit up.  

As I'm sitting in the wendy's drive thru yesterday, these morons are talking about cannabis stocks and how they are mostly canadian and can't benefit from the bill passing ect ect.  

  Anyways, they say "Sundial Growers are taking advantage of this rally and raising funds"  

I then go look at the SEC filings and they haven't filed a damn thing since 2/4.

p.s.  i only listen to CNBC to get info on stocks i shouldn't buy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Weed! Smoke week and read this about GME

Crossposting. This keeps getting removed. Think why 

Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212

​

ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares

​

Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!

​

Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??

​

TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%

​

​

Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be £Greedy ::

If you see mistakes please correct me....

​

Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)

Cheers!

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will "only pay" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

I'm guessing no because the gay mods deleted my post, here's a screenshot :

the KRE Rally is not over and here is why :

Regional banks, more so than the big money centers in XLF make their $ by taking loans from the FED or depositors who block their money for a year or two and lend it for longer maturities. The best proxy for this metric is the 10/2 spread and it has been going to the moon !

Regional banks are the entities that are most exposed to "small business" in the market, in fact if you want to go long the "real economy", KRE is about your only bet along with some office/mall REITS/B2B stocks and the true winner, which hasn't been frontran yet of the upcoming reopening is the real economy. 

Have you heard that papi biden is working on **another stimulus package focused on infrastructure ?** Who loans the money to the small bizes who work on that shit ? you guessed it, KRE. I think most of the market has a hard time understanding the size and potential impact of what the dems are cooking for us, here's an excerpt from top strategist at MS leila : 

 ***Unprecedented stimulus***  *– The magnitude of monetary + fiscal stimulus in the US is almost hard for the brain to fully appreciate. We’re not economists, but it appears as if we are on track for \~9 Trillion between fiscal + monetary in the US, over 3x what we did during the financial crisis.  On the fiscal side, if Biden gets his $1.9 Trillion on the back of Trump’s $2.2 Trillion + $900 Billion plans, total Fiscal stimulus over the past year will be \~$5 Trillion or \~24% of U.S. GDP.  The 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus amounted to \~ $1 Trillion -- so we're doing 5x the fiscal.  On the Monetary side, the Fed Balance sheet has risen by $3.6 Trillion since 2019. In 2008-2010 it rose $1.4 Trillion, so we're doing 2.6x the Monetary.   These monetary and fiscal efforts in the US equate to over 40% of GDP.* 

**But isn't the fed keeping interest rates super low ?** 

**Yes they are but this is the limit,** during the last minutes of the FOMC the topic was du jour was removing the special QE programme. Essentially, given that the **worst is behind us in the real economy, the FED WILL NOT BE MARGINALLY MORE DOVISH AND THE NEXT STEP IS A RATE HIKE CYCLE.** it might start in 22 or 23 but no later. Of course it will be priced in both rates and Bank stocks way ahead of time. in fact you can see that bonds have been selling off lately as the market digests the news around the infrastructure package and the FED speeches always make the bonds bounce but then it gets sold again :).

&#x200B;

I'm in SNDL at 1.12.  It was trading below $2 so I thought I'd make sure I take some profits.  When it was around 1.95 I set a stop loss for $1.80.  Within 60 seconds I watched the price tumble, my order get filled, and then the price shot immediately back up.  

Now that's either some WSB ape-like timing or computer programs or something controlling things.  Is this MM and if so help me understand how that's possible?  I'm wishing my shares weren't sold, ooof._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily reminder that buying GME at 300 before 28/1 was a great play at the time. Yeah that’s right, I fucking said it. 

I’ve noticed the FUD campaign has been shifting lately, It’s shifted towards calling al you retards actually retarded for buying GME at it’s height. While yeah, buying high and selling low is actually retarded, I am not disputing that. 

But what I’ve noticed is that no one seems to be mentioning the fact that Robinhood (and by extension the DTC)  LITERALLY HIT THE ‘OFF’ SWITCH ON BUYS. That’s fucking right it was a great play before 28/1 even at 300 or 400. (If you bought at 300 after 28/1 you may actually be retarded)

The FUD campaign (or general memory loss from all the weed stonks) has made most of you forget that WE WERE FUCKING ROBBED.

Never forget that GME is not over.

Never forget that we were ROBBED of millions of dollars, not only in evaporated gains, but in actual investments with hard earned cash.

Edit: DTC

Lots of people seem to be understanding this post as saying GME will go up diamond hands etc. This is not what the purpose of this post is. 

The purpose of this post is to make people remember that this was not fair play. 

If all you retards calling me retarded and delusional could learn to fucking read, that be great.

Edit 2:

As a response to all the arguments that it wasn’t a great play purely based on the fundamentals.

It was never about the fundamentals in the first place, it was a risky bet based on the incoming short squeeze that was purely stopped dead in it’s tracks because of the RH/DTC restrictions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Full Send 🚀🚀🚀 Love this sub!!!

UPDATE: Removed $AMD and $NVDA as they are not actual manufacturers of chips_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Complete DD on HYLN. No battery patent, no IP, no product. Nikola 2.0? Hyliion became a thing in the WSB world once again today.  I'll get to the once again part in a few.

I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 & 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.

First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their [Website](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx)


Revenue: 0

PE: Divide by zero error


Profit Margin: Zilch

Operating Cash Flow: -11.53 million.


Net loss per share 2019: 0.45, Net Loss per share 2020: 0.76. They are burning more money faster.



**Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the "new battery" isn't patented or at least mentioned here**


R & D burned 8.13 million in 2020, and Admin burned 3.7 million.



Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020




Their R&D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.

They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.

**In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?**

Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.

The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all. **So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.**

**[Other notes: The new battery system isn't patented or proprietary, and is not listed in their patents.  Which are pretty lackluster.](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/hyliion-inc)**


[I\[f you read between the lines, the press release was stating they have a new battery cooling system. That's it.](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2021/Hyliion-Introduces-Next-Generation-Battery-Module-to-Improve-Performance-and-Efficiency/default.aspx)

And how it became a thing on reddit once again: Almost a year ago when it launched, it hit $59/share, then dropped to $13 where it stayed.  It's already made bagholders on reddit with BS vaporware.  Don't let it do it again.


TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 💩


Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.

**Main Takeaways: Their patent portfolio is trash, the miracle battery isn't patented, they say their IP is only worth 346k, and they dump more money on admin then they do R&D**

and here is my loss porn, cause even though I still think I'm right, I didn't win, so it doesn't matter. https://i.redd.it/fibuqe8ia4h61.png_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Warren BAffett For those of you who were here prior to GMExplosion you might remember Warren Buffett was accumulating shares in a company last quarter which he kept secret. The last time he has done this was in 2015. By my calculations of his historic fillings, he will be releasing his 13F on Monday (deadline is Tuesday, not sure how market closed affects it) and it should reveal the company. 

I've kept my ears to the ground and while there were a lot of theories, the only rumour I've heard from a reputable source was Boeing (the source being @deitaone, which publishes Bloomerg terminal updates).

Yet, NOK has been dropping like a fly below price levels from Nov 2020, even though it had an outstanding earnings report??? To top it off, it outperformed it's market competitors, yet the price continues to jump off cliffs?

Obviously it's the hedge funds being dicks. It has to be. The company is doing better than most startups because it actually has cash flow. It had 2.5B Euros in net cash flow, which is up .8B from last Q4.^(1) Cash on hand has increased by 2.1B Euro from last year as well. This is by all means a relatively "safe" company to invest in, as it is stockpiling cash and generating it as well...

Yes you.

I wasn't bothering anyone.  I simply woke up, checked my watchlist, and decided, after 3 MONTHS - three months - of tracking APHA, Wednesday was the day to buy. 

It always moved nicely.  Outpaced the sector, held firm when the sector took a hit. 

It didn't seem 'flashy', or 'gambling'.

It was just little ol me, who had been enjoying 100% gains over the past 12 months, cautiously, carefully, casually buying stocks I liked and accruing them. 

APHA was moving, and I astutely determined, "People are waking up that this is the right play.  Time to pounce!"

Pounce I did. 

That night, I texted a buddy.  "Hey, did you see know that APHA was being discussed over in WSB?  I hope this price jump isn't because of those guys..."

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-12-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to log another positive week

> * U.S. stock futures fell Friday, one day after a mixed session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average dip slightly from its previous record high close, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out new record high closes. All three stock benchmarks were tracking for their second straight positive week, in a continuation of February’s strength. So far this month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased 4.8%, 5.4% and 7.3%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 broke two-month winning streaks in January, while the Nasdaq rose for a fourth month in a row in January.

*****

> # 2. Booming Disney+ helps to offset theme park slump

> * Shares of Disney rose about 2% in premarket trading after the company reported an adjusted fiscal first-quarter profit of 32 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 41 cents per share. Revenue fell 22% to $16.25 billion from a year earlier, though it did beat estimates. Due to Covid, Disney saw a slump in theme park attendance and box office results, but the success of its streaming video service continued. Disney+ added more than 21 million subscribers during the quarter for a total of 94.9 million.

*****

> # 3. White House to address travel, education concerns

> * Major airline CEOs are scheduled to meet virtually Friday with the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, according to Reuters. The meeting comes as airlines, unions and industry groups strongly object to the possibility of requiring predeparture Covid testing for domestic flights.
The CDC plans to issue new guidelines Friday on how to reopen U.S. schools as safely as possible. Pressure to reopen or expand in-person learning has been building for months as students and parents tire of remote classes. Reopening schools is a top priority for the Biden administration.

*****

> # 4. U.S. secures 200 million more Covid vaccine doses

> * The White House secured deals for 100 million additional doses of Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and 100 million more of Moderna’s. During Thursday’s tour of the National Institutes of Health, President Joe Biden said the U.S. will have now enough supply of the two-shot vaccines to inoculate 300 million Americans by the end of July. Biden is trying to pick up the pace of vaccinations after a slower-than-expected rollout under former President Donald Trump. Roughly 34.7 million out of some 331 million Americans have received at least their first dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, February 12th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING! Hi, I have been lurking here for a while now. Recently I began reading WSB more, commenting, etc, because it helps numb the pain of my losses and adds some good laughs. My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of "investing", I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I'd always think let's enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I'd want to cash out a bit. This isn't even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. 

I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn't rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???

If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren't actually allowed to make money?

EDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!

EDIT: Thank you for the Awards and Karma, I have no idea what it is but hey atleast some numbers went up for once!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’ll never make enough own a Tesla. What I want is much more retarded. I’m just not retarded enough to do it. I might be retarded, or deranged. Not sure yet.

A few years back real life stopped being good and I sold off my fun account to get through the hard times. There was the divorce due to my wife’s boyfriend (no joke). Then came my dog’s surgery... before the TSLA split. Tsla paid for it so I can’t complain.

My issue is that I’m consistently making boomer plays now and I can’t help myself. Last year things stopped making sense to me, and the stuff that did make sense didn’t pan out... thanks PCG. The stuff that didn’t make sense exploded. Hertz...? But, again and again, this sub called it. I just didn’t see it.

Help me make sense of what happening so I can buy my unicorn with my fun account a ride to Xanadu.

My unicorn is not a Cyber Truck. I’ll never make that kind of money.

What I want is a van. A very specific, ugly van. A van that I can get my old motorcycle into and go cross country and forget the troubles of the past few years.

The unicorn:

https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/4711175038924333/?ref=search&referral_code=undefined

So, here’s my thesis...

I think people that made their GME millions in these risky plays will be looking for Boomer plays now that they are done gambling.

I also think the market, now, functions like a voting system where individual traders are investing in what they want the new world to look like, not what is exactly the best investment.

Here are my plays.

I think PCG goes to $20/ share in the expectation of a dividend in 2023. That might be in 2022... too far out. (yes... I am too boomer to understand this is not a good idea). I had a few 2023/$10 calls, but, I used the gains for a vasectomy. (Worth it)

I think STWD recovers. They’re a REIT with a 10% dividend. And they’re still down with $6 to go prior to reaching where they were prior to COVID.

SENS (handful of shares), IDEX (probably a bad idea to have shares), And a handful of penny stocks. All of these plays are up 100%.


Have a completely past the rubicon and ventured into boomer territory? Is this it - no going back? Should I just dump my little fun account into vanguard too, give up and make the safe plays? How do you risk it all for your dreams again once you get old?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $600M in inflows to UVXY in the past 4 days. Is this a big hedge or a big short position? Sauce: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/proshares-ultra-vix-short-term-futures-daily-inflows-129-8-mln

UVXY has added more than $600 million of new money in less than a week even as the volatility ETF has fallen to 1-year lows. 

Short interest in UVXY has also gone to its highest level since March. This either means more people are hedging at market highs or that institutions are buying shares in order to short it. 

This means that it could be either an extremely bearish signal or an extremely bullish signal. While this is about the level UVXY was at before the big correction last year, the short interest could also mean a lot of volatility is about to come off the market. 

This is also a measurement of 1-month VIX futures, meaning that the bet is on the move happening over the very short term. Is anyone else playing this or using it to hedge?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB When They Buy Calls on Cannabis Stocks _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD and why Sue Bae is giving me a Semi (DD) 
*Processing img 962rkkl28yg61...*

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) **- Advanced Mooning Devices** 🚀 have gained +12.8% over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of +28.7%. Business is good.

*The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.* 

If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' & 'why is my pp small'? 

Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $3.24 billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%. **For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $3.2 billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.** 

*Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...*

AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.

Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa "Su Bae" pointed out on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) that the supply constraints were in the "low end of the PC market." AKA nothing to worry about.

So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([**TSM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window. 

Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

TLDR:

4/16 100C | 2/19 91C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing? Specific recommendations inside The short version: Shroom stocks have huge upside, due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high (loads of studies quoted to back it up) + ongoing approval of many psilocybin-based pharmaceutical drugs in North America + current administration making decriminalization easier. Several psychedelic mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

3 parts to this DD:

1. The science - why psychedelic mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products.
2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as pharmaceutical drugs
3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions

**My core thesis:** Psychedelic mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire psychedelic sector up.

**1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS**

The evidence behind the effectiveness of psychedelics for various health conditions is piling up.

Harvard University: "the study authors and the commentators — who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber — recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens" - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/Reviving\_the\_study\_of\_hallucinogens](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Reviving_the_study_of_hallucinogens)

Pharmacognosy Review: "They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future." - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/)

3 Biotech Journal: "This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases." - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/)

DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given “breakthrough therapy” designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).

Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/)

Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396)

A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513)

SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.

**2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION**

Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.

I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.

However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.

Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.

And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.

According to [thekit.ca](https://thekit.ca) \- In Canada, "The process is well on its way. In August 2020, federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end-of-life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness. (Fifty-three-year-old Laurie Brooks, who has colon cancer, was one of them—read her story next in our Psychedelics Now series). Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased."

In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.

As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received "breakthrough therapy" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.

This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.

SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.

**3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS**

Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stock do I recommend?

1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too.
2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment. Probably has the biggest upside potential.

There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted this stock for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.

My position:

* 100 shares of $CMPS @ $50
* 1200 shares of $MMEDF @ $3.7

Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.

***Shitty Corporate Governance:***

I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.

People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with "only" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's "owner" controls the entire conglomerate with a 3.4% ownership stake.

[This is Samsung Group's Ownership Structure](https://preview.redd.it/jqvamel8m0h61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dbc7133b7a239b7f90b8c56787791b3ebf9461)

***Circular Holdings:***

A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.

The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.

***Prices Held Down:***

Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.

The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.

**tl;dr:**

Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is "they're cheap". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB/AMZN Speculation Part 2: Forget cars. It's was all about the drones from the start.

Secondly, with regards to those who claim that "Amazon can just program their own drones" and thus has no need for BlackBerry, I implore you to check out BB's trove of Government certifications (link [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications)) and 40000+ patents (link [https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/](https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/)). 

With that out of the way, let's talk D-R-O-N-E-S

Here are a few more supporting evidence for my hypothesis:

December 2013 - Bezos reveals Amazon Prime Air, a R&D project to deliver parcels with "octocopters" He suggested it would be \~5 years or so before it is available to consumers. [LINK](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/) Well, it's been 7 years now so we are already 2+ years behind schedule.

December 18, 2015 - Amazon file for patents pertaining to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (LINK at bottom)

December 18, 2015 - AWS IOT (Internet of Things) launches [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-now-generally-available/)

>"We built IoT Core because connected devices are proliferating. They are in your house, your car, your office, your school, and perhaps even in your body! Like some of our more advanced customers, we have been building systems around connected devices for quite some time. **Our experience with** [**Amazon Robotics**](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/)**, drones (**[**Amazon Prime Air**](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011)**)**, the [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/echo), the [Dash Button](http://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button), and multiple generations of [Kindles](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle) has given us a well-informed perspective on how to serve this really important emerging market"

Is it reaching to suggest that Amazon very much had DRONES on their minds when they started AWS IOT on the same day the filed for UAV patents? Take a look at this [picture](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-MY-sGfWtWNrFljWJj01HIzWM34=/0x0:811x612/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:811x612):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8738261/drone_interior.png) to get an idea of what Amazon had in mind.

Fast forward to 2020

In Jan 2020, AWS announced a collaboration with BlackBerry:

>"The platform will integrate the BlackBerry QNX operating system and over-the-air software update services, with **AWS IoT** cloud services for secure connectivity and telematics, Amazon SageMaker for developing ML models, and **AWS IoT** edge services for in-vehicle ML inference."

Alright, so the purpose of this partnership is "secure connectivity", "telematics (monitoring of vehicle)" and "ML (machine learning)".. nothing that specifically points to drones yet

In June 2020, BlackBerry partners with DeDrone (a leader in airspace security):

>"New advanced technologies have the potential to solve some of today’s most pressing challenges, however, they also introduce new security risks,” said Christoph Erdmann, Senior Vice President of Secure Communications, BlackBerry. “**Drones are one of the many IoT endpoints that add to the growing chaos that security leaders must navigate.** We’re excited to partner with Dedrone to offer a critical solution that organizations around the world can use to keep citizens and the public safe.”

Drones. Security. IoT. 5 months after Amazon and BlackBerry began their collaboration.

In September 2020, Amazon Drone Fleet receives FAA approval. Did BB have anything to do with it? Maybe, maybe not.

Alright, so let's pretend that you subscribe to this hypothesis that BB had a hand in Amazon's drone project. So what? BFD, right? How many drones are we even talking about? 20000? 50000?

Amazon delivers \~3 billion packages a year globally. Drones are by far the cheapest option for last mile delivery (contrast that with a dude wear khaki shorts driving a 2 ton truck from the Amazon fulfillment center to your condo) so it's no stretch to suggest that it will be Amazon's preferred method of delivery like 99%+ of the time. No, a drone isn't going to fly all the way from Seattle, Washington to your porch in Blaine.. but an autonomous truck might take your parcel from Seattle to Blaine and let a drone complete the rest of the journey. Or something. 

3 billion deliveries divided by 365  = 8.219 million deliveries per day. Even if drones can deliver packages to you in 30 minutes on average (60 min round trip) and worked around the clock with no need for recharging or maintenance, it would take 342465 drones. That's 342465 unmanned flying vehicles collecting flight data for IVY. 

I'm gonna stop myself here before this completely devolves into JC/Jassy fan fiction. The whole point of this coke bender DD is to suggest that BB's potential isn't merely "OS for Cars." In fact, cars only account for 175 million out of Blackberry's 500 million IOT endpoints. 

We're talking about drones, flying taxis, robots, roombas, fighter jets, tanks, and yes, EVs too. Essentially, anything that MOVES and CAN POTENTIALLY BE HACKED = $$$ for BB. I wager that there will be plenty of things in the future which fall into both of those categories.

Position: a modest amount of BB shares.

I understand that some people are feeling bad for new users losing all of their money and feel the need to fucking absolutely flood the sub with posts either explaining how not to “end up as a bag holder” or “why not to exit your positions yet” but jesus fucking christ it only makes things worse. All of these new friends that just joined do not give a SINGLE fuck about the context of your post. When they see a ticker in the title or body of your post, followed up with 50k upvotes, they’re just gonna buy the stock. This shit is wildly annoying. The weed stocks could have been so much better than they ended up if it wasn’t for that shit.

Edit for the new friends: if you see a stock on here get popular, that means you are going to lose money on it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SKM undervalued. I like the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.

SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd.

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say "OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE" but I noticed something from another "penny stock" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

**Edit 2:** Was asked to see how my "theory" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:

**Edit 4:** WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.

**Edit 5:** FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.

FIN_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Feeling bad for new members - some advice Listen I’ll be honest with you all. I’ve been on this sub for 3 years. Multiple people come and go but most importantly few survive most leave after their first big loss. 

Few lessons:
1) At the end of the day it’s every man for himself in the markets. No one is going to care for you if you go broke we are not privileged like Melvin. 

2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price. If the answer is yes hold, if no sell. 

2.5) find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify

3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top. 

4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet. Not fucking OTM weekly FDs
Not financial advice just sharing my opinion.

Let me know if you see something contradictory._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To all the tide pod eaters and YOLO investors. APE STRoNG. Some advice... Some of you guys or whatnots have some cash to toss around for gambles. 

But look here. This subreddit was for guys who bet against certain markets and post their gains or loss. What we have now is a fuckwad of retards who think they can get rich quick by pump and dump.

Here's the thing. Since the gme fiasco wsb has drawn a lot of attention from the hedge funds. So any time you tares talk about the next big push on a stock, the professionals are watching and will play you. 

Most of us that were originally part of this group used the forum as a means for learning and laughs.  Now it has become a zoo.

Many of us want to make some gains through good investments with a bit of gambles. But you fuckwads that have infested this subreddit have now drawn the attention of the major players in the market and want to take all the money you have.

Get out now,  this pump and dump scheme won't last long and you tards will find out the hard way that the house always wins.

You may have made a little money watching the market all day, but us real investors and real workers, don't have all day to look at a screen.

This fuckwad mob mentality is fucking up the market and other people's investments and livelihood. Stop trying to pump and dump. The HF can see and track your dimbasses before you can do anything about it.

Those are all "traditional" auto companies, and the average is $115 Billion

Tesla is at almost $800 Billion, NIO is at around $100 Billion despite being much smaller than even Tesla.

My question is, when the dust settles, which won't be for at least a decade if not more, are EV companies going to be valued on average higher than traditional car companies are valued today? Will it depend on whether or not they also have a battery/energy play like Tesla?

Just wondering, is NIO overvalued, or does it represent where the market thinks EV companies should be valued?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Never buy the stocks that the people on CNBC tell you to buy This should be common sense: DO NOT BUY THE STOCKS THAT THE PEOPLE ON CNBC TELL YOU TO BUY.

I'd actually go a step further and say that you should sell your stock if the people on CNBC tell you to buy it. If they tell you to buy weed stocks, wait until the prices inevitably fall to buy it.

1. Denial - There's absolutely no way this stock will not squeeze! The short squeeze is coming, it's just as matter of time. It's happening, and I will not accept no for an answer.    

2. Anger - These POS Hedgefund bullies, forever taking our piece of the pie. Where's the fairness in all of this? Where is God? Why is this happening?  

3. Barganining -  What if AMC become digital? What if AMC is purchased by Amazon or Netflix? Errr post pandemic we will see movie theatres open again and it will rise, everyone loves the cinema. Also.....sHoRt LaDdEr aTacKS   

4. Depression - Is there any point to this any more? I feel robbed and all I want to do is sleep. Everytime I look at the charts I feel like crying myself to sleep whilst eating chocolate.   

5. Acceptance - I'm ok with this, I'm a doofus. I joined a hype train, made a huge mistake. I will learn from this and just HOLD until I can make my money back or take a 30% loss. Whatever, it is what it is.

[Get help today](https://grief.com)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Yandex (YNDX) is poised for optimal growth and massive expansion I'm going to cut to the chase because I know most of you are on the verge of bankruptcy at age 19 because you got in at $450 on GME and wondering why its not going to $1000 after you paper handed at $439 and sold.

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

&#x200B;

# But first, fundamentals.

This is to help you sleep better at night so you can worry more about your 35c 2/19 AMC calls you blew your money into.

I don't like re-inventing a lot of stuff so this is simply principles I've adopted from Grand-Daddy Graham

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?

Check the 2018 & 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else? **They currently have enough cash (1.1b$) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.**

In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have **is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.**

This is their free cash flow from previous 3 years and TTM. You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m

# Now, on to some of their services.

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Market**

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. "Delivery with a click" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Alice**

Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.

Oil is coming back for me today. I opened down 2k. Maybe not as retarded a play as I thought._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some important advice for my fellow Canadian investors. Maybe it was just me who didn't know this but put your investments/stocks  into a RRSP or TFSA account immediately if you haven't already. If you  currently just use a margin account, 50% of any gain you sell is taxed!!  In a RRSP or TFSA it is not taxed. And with a TFSA, any withdrawals you  make are not taxed at all! Where as with a RRSP they are. I only just  learned this and would have been pissed to find out if i sold my  shares I'd be paying tax on 50% of my gains so this is for newbies like myself  who didn't know.

Edit: My understanding of the gains tax was wrong but is now corrected._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To all my Peak Freak Apes - there is one major reason to not let out of your SNDL position just yet So the market corrected today. There has been a ton of press in the last 72 hours about how Sundial is an inflated stock and that no doubt had an effect on the market today. That, and, if we are being frank, the stock was probably a bit overvalued given the lack of DD that actually caused it rise.

But let's pause right there and take a minute to discuss value. Value, some may argue, is only held intrinsically. However, the reality is that value is always set by the buyer. The market is driven by market psychology. The point here is that no matter what reason SNDL gained over the last two weeks, the value was there. For those of us who bought and and have gains, and those of us who bought and are holding the bag right now -- the fact of the matter is for a period of time the value of this stock had increased. We ourselves saw the higher value in it, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it at the price we did, now would we have? Whether a rise in value is due to the company experiencing a catalyzing event, or because a bunch of retarded apes like flinging their own shit around, it doesn't really matter - the value went up.

Now, I only paused for that brief aside because I want to tell my fellow apes - stop being peak freaks. A day of correction isn't the end of the world. The fact of the matter is, this stock may have been overvalued at $4, but at under a dollar it was drastically undervalued given the "money moves" they have been making in the last 10 months.

Now, segue into the point of all this. Due to the rise in value over the last 9 days of SNDL, regardless of what caused that rise, SNDL has made it into the territory of becoming compliant. 9 consecutive days of over $1 and tomorrow is day 10. What does this mean? It means the stock, having been in jeopardy of being delisted from Nasdaq ever since it transferred to the exchange, lost investor interest. Now, with a 10 day consecutive period trading over $1, the stock will be no longer be in jeopardy of being delisted (at least for 90 more days). The Big takeaway here is this: SINCE $SNDL WAS LISTED ON NASDAQ, IT HAS \*NEVER\* REACHED THIS COMPLIANCE THRESHOLD. Since day 1 it has literally been fighting to stay on NASDAQ. Now, in all likelihood, it is going to get to stay. This will likely serve as a catalyst event to boost the stock short term.

I am not saying this stock is destined to go back to $4, but if you are down today and want to let your shares grow and then go for the profit take, the opportunity has not disappeared.

&#x200B;

TL;DR $SNDL gets NASDAQ compliance tomorrow and then we should anticipate a bump of some sort in the price due to the new-founded exposure.

Also, I have an IQ of 60._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB, listen up. YOLO on a stock you like: Has anyone else noticed that newbies will come, massively pump up a stock, and it rises by 1000%+ only to plummet immediately after?  
Yeah, it’s a pattern. Raise stocks for about 5+ days. They open massively higher than they stay during the day (good for hedgies, who are making it look like there’s huge interest, or they’re selling on those artificial highs dumdums create by after hours trading without setting a price limit.  
The last FOUR stocks I’ve been tracking from DD here (thank goodness I didn’t buy) have been massively inflated in ~5 days, and now they have all announced that they leveraged the new higher stock price to offer millions of stocks to investors at prices 100x what the stock was valued at just a week or two ago.   
Now, since there is a massive influx of stocks flooding the market, the price falls dramatically. Just watch. All the stocks being pushed here this past week are about to absolutely tank, and soon- sooner than you can get out from under it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is an agriculture monopoly making the John Deere stock go to the moon? Source: [https://www.equities.com/how-long-until-big-agriculture-takes-over-cannabis](https://www.equities.com/how-long-until-big-agriculture-takes-over-cannabis)

Basically in the article is says there is a monopoly of a few players (Bayer, Corteva, ChemChina and BASF) controlling the entire agriculture sector and they decide for the farmers what tractor they should buy and they dictate the farmers what to grow and how. Supply chains are also very short and that means things could break very quickly, is this why we also see mass farmer protests around the world? I wonder about this because I see that stock price only going up and I am not sure why it does.

I could be wrong, then please let me know in the comments?

If you started invested any time after April of 2020 and think you are genius then all you need is one 🌈🐻 month to lose all. This post is just a warning of things that can happen._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Went balls deep on TLRY/APHA FDs yesterday. Not my finest moment _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Meme Stock Cycle I've noticed newer people aren't sure how this works. I told someone yesterday that SNDL would dump today or Friday and they asked me "what my thesis was". There is no thesis. You nerds can't just go by numbers or info about the company. This is human behavior and computer algos programmed by humans.

So let me lay out what happened with SNDL (and most meme stocks for that matter)

Early Adopter Phase - This was when SNDL was under $0.5 recently. People who suspect the stock is undervalued and a lot of bigger money investors are loading up. The stock may trade relatively flat or go through small increases.

Middle Phase - 01/28: SNDL spikes up to 100%, before closing the day up about 39% at $0.83. Very high volume on the day. This is where people who are watching for activity get in (I bought here).

Late/FOMO Phase - 02/08: SNDL spikes roughly 14% and goes into a stage of parabolic gains as retail buyers rush in and FOMO takes hold. Word spreads like wildfire across social media and forums. Everybody is aware at this point.

\*Short sellers know how this works as well and they will enter positions at some point during this phase

Profit Taking Phase - After a few days of huge gains on very high volume, buying reaches a crescendo. The earliest adopters have already made several times their initial investment and are ready to cash out. The people who bought in the middle know that the "smart money" has either already sold or is about to sell. This leads to chain reaction of increased selling. Fear can take hold over the Late Adopters as they do not want to lose money and panic sell.

Set for next cycle - The stock usually drills hard, followed by some more selling and/or a dead cat bounce if the drop is too drastic. Over the next trading sessions, price will go through smaller up an down bounces until a new "baseline price" is found. The stock will usually trade sideways for a bit until the cycle begins anew. (This last part is hard to predict). Stocks may see very little activity for weeks or months in this phase, or buyers may quickly regain interest, especially if a catalyst appears.

This isn't WSB doing this or the media or whatever grand conspiracy you think it is. It's happened many times and will continue to happen

**Edit**: Decided to scoop up some APHA, TLRY, and SNDL from the panic sellers during premarket. There's no "set" way to determine it, but I felt that all of these got "oversold" by the panic sellers.

Ticker    $52.34    
Thesis

“Funeral Home” & “funeral home near me” are trending & $SCI is the largest provider of funeral, cremation, and cemetery services.

Based on the Q4 Covid deaths and also an aging Boomer population, $SCI is well positioned for consistent growth for years to come. They are also poised for an excellent earnings report on Monday, 2/15… Load up soon or you’ll be left in the dust.

The search trends for funeral home are at all time highs on the 5 year chart. I will also provide a few snapshots from the earnings transcript where the SCI team is discussing the increased interest in Preneed cemetery plots. If you’re unfamiliar with this, it’s basically buying a cemetery plot before you need one. They’re typically financed over a 5 year term, but the revenue is instantly recognized.

The SCI team also pointed out on their last earnings call that their earnings were strong due to the unfortunate amounts of COVID deaths. This was during Q3 earnings, and you’ll see in the chart below that there were massive increases in deaths during Q4 compared to Q3. The pandemic has instilled fear in many, and as deaths increase, the fear increases. This will likely result in increases in at need services and preneed bookings.

Many companies benefited from COVID from a financial perspective. $SCI is one that has seen a major boost in revenue’s from the pandemic, however they will not experience the some drop off. Death is an unfortunate thing, but will happen to us all. The aging Boomer population will continue to result in increased revenues for $SCI

CDC Deaths 2020 Vs 2019 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm

The CDC is a bit behind on reporting of deaths, however most interesting correlation I found is that April had a major uptick in % differential for deaths. This major uptick, and sustained differential from April to September can arguably be attributed to the pandemic. Both due to COVID deaths, and indirect deaths as a result of the pandemic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any ideas of the relationship between robinhood free stocks and the hedgefunds intentions?

Thats all i have for now. 106 GME shares @ 63.94_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Old money trying to anticipate the top The past two days there have been pretty sharp intra-day declines across the stock market that more or less recover. These are rather concerted efforts, and I didn’t put together the pieces until I saw CNBC pushing the “froth” narrative. The first dip happened at 10AM on Wednesday and the second happened 12:00PM on Thursday, February 11th. 

The criteria seems to be NASDAQ Composite over 14k, Dow over 31.5k. Whoever is doing this is using ridiculously broad market sell orders across hundreds, if not thousands, of securities at the same time. I don’t have a Bloomberg terminal, but I think they are trying to time the moment when the order book is either the most full, or most empty. If they are targeting the order books at the thinnest, that may be an attempt to cause a market crash. 

However, if they are targeting the thickest or just a moderately full order book, then this is probably the collective consciousness of old money trying to time the market, and it will pass when they hear cool heads like Tom Lee explain the facts.

Fidelity's asset book allows them to keep order flow private for stonks, but even though they charge a .65c fee for options trades they still sell your order flow data. 

The same is true of TDA.

Everyone does it at this point, so there's not much you can do about it. That said, I think everyone should know when they're the product and not the customer. If you primarily trade options in the US there is not a broker (that I'm aware of) that does not sell your order flow to someone like citadel.

Automod: If you remove this for being 'low-effort' I'll kick you right in your robot testicles. You rusty bag of bolts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One’s theory on the $RKT, Warren Buffet partnership. The below link is not my post, and it is not my RKT DD part II. The link is a post by u/DBCooperlived in
r/TeamRKT who is unable to post within WSB due to our hardworking mods.

The post contains a *SPECULATIVE* theory on the Berkshire / $RKT partnership. Although speculative, I believe it has much merit. 

If this theory does come to fruition, I believe the world may witness another short squeeze that grabs international media attention. Fortunes will be made, but more importantly: memes will be made. 

There is some Deep Fucking Value in this trade.

What's been happening here? Rockets here, rockets there. This whole fucking sub is filled with people throwing around their red rockets. Some of these rockets go up into the ethereal tendie heavens, but most go plunge straight into the markets gaping, mangy abyss.

Why do I mention rockets?

Enter ARKX. The rocket itself. The real deal rocket. For all you tards who haven't looked up from blowing bubbles in your cereal for the past 10 years, let me paint you a picture on what has been going on.

The future is here. We are in a god damned technological revolution. Most of all, we're in a new space race. "Wait, you mean we're going back to blasting chimps into space then fingering their assholes when they get back, then telling the Reds to smell my finger?" No. We're going to space to stay. And you what's going to happen up there? Industry.

NASA already estimates that wealth from mining minerals on asteroids is in the QUADRILLIONS. I call bullshit on that figure. The universe is infinite. Therefore there is infinite wealth up there. NASA's gonna go up there, and some cuck with a clipboard will be like, "Yea, we lowballed that one." 

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70)

I know, I know, all you dingleberrys that are stuck in the 80's, are thinking, "NASA choked on Challenger's dick and died right there on the spot." That's sure what it looked like. Well guess what. They're back, and they're now riding the coat tails of every fucking smooth-brained, money making messiah that you worship and make gainz off of. Did you look at the article that I linked? Probably not. I'll sum it up for you. Jeff Bezoz has his plans of going up there too, to do a little mining for himself. Look at his fucking head. Notice anything? IT'S SMOOTH AS EGGS. Draw your own conclusion on that one.

I don't really even need to touch on Papa Musk's plans. His mission is our mission. It's inherent at this point. You know everything that he touches turns into hard cash for you. Everytime you sit there trying to yank one out of your noodly, skinny pale trouser snake, you always have to, "pour one out for Elon." His target is to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050. 

[https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1)

Do you think he's going to overpromise and underdeliver on that? Do you know what his kid's name is? This man is looking so far into the future, we don't even have language to express his kid's name.

Here's what's going to happen. In no more than 10 years time. More like 5 years. Captain Kirk will be on TV trying to sell you intergalactic travel packages at discounted rates. Of course you go. Your buddy, Chad, is stuck flipping burgers on some distant mining base, talking up all the dividends he's racking up bi-annually off his companies plan. You, on the other hand, have more nefarious plans in mind. Sure it's fun to hit Chad's bong on the dark side of some cold asteroid and talk about the old days, but you have better plans. You've got a date with a cheap alien lady-boy whore, parked on lovers lane overlooking the Eagle Nebula. All the while, you plan on going knuckles deep in any mucous filled orifice you can find. And that's on a THURSDAY.

So here's the skinny on ARKX. Listen up. For all the ass hats who don't know who Cathie Wood is, you will now. In 2018, Papa Musk was in a bit of a rut. He was losing faith in TSLA, and contemplating it's future, (I know, hard to believe). In fact, it was so bad, Elon was practically begging to suck Tim Apples ding-a-ling to get bought up. 

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356)

You know who was there by Papa Musk's side? That's right. Meet your new mommy, Momma Wood. She gave Papa Elon the best fucking prostate orgasm ever, and with that, the clarity that TSLA was going to propel him to Mars and beyond. So every time you're having wet dreams about sucking Elon's monster dong, you're eternally in debt to Mama Wood. But she doesn't fault you for not giving her credit. You know why that is? Because she is a Goddess. She's humble. She knows that at some point, one day, your eyes will be opened, and that you will recognize her for her past efforts, and for her future plans. ARKX. She knows that once you have this realization, you will be bent over, gallon jug of off-branded cooking fat in hand, ready to have her peg your stanky ingrown hair infested asshole. You will be BEGGING her, "MoAR tHicC GaINz, PLEEZE!" 

So what's play here. I love a good YOLO. I wake up every morning expecting to see gainz porn from all these rocket launches we've been having. For me, personally, I'm mildly autistic. You could say half-autistic. My wife and her boyfriend's children are all autistic. I want the YOLO gainz, but I also want to know where to put some of my gainz, as my wife, her boyfriend, and their children are all dependent on me for money. So I got to be smart, you see. As I see it, ARKX is a slow cooker for your tendies. There's nothing like making a cool, quick ten bagger on some FD's. That rush is unmatched. That feeling of having a greasy burger after munching on your boyfriends asshole for an hour straight. ARKX, on the other hand, is like few have thought to experience. Like fine aged wine or whiskey. Slow cooked, tender, melt in your melt tendies. 100x in the next ten years, conservatively, tendies. Set-it-and-forget-it tendies. They practically fall apart in your mouth. 

This DD doesn't even begin to touch the vastness of what's all in play with space exploration plays.

I don't know what's going to be in ARKX, or where it will begin trading at. I also don't know the exact date it will begin trading, I heard the last week of March at the latest. Keep an eye out. I'm sure you will hear when it does commence. For me, I already threw a bunch of stagnant savings I had in ARKF. Let me tell you what, I am not disappointed I did that. When ARKX comes out, my IRA will be converted to ARKX, but I will be keeping my boomer AAPL, and holy TSLA shares. I will be set. I have utmost confidence this will be the easiest, long term print around. 

Thank you for your time. I'm a half retard, not an investment advisor. 

TLDR: ARKX will print you space tendies for all your orifice fingering needs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Prediction: Bestbuy stock is going to tank  A friend of mine has worked for Bestbuy for the last eight years.  She  just got laid off along with a whole bunch of other people not just at  hear store, but all across the country.  She was told that the company  is going to be going through an across the board restructuring.  I  expect the stock to kick up a couple points because the layoffs will  bring more profits, but then its going to tank.  It's too late in the  game to restructure your entire business model.  If you own Bestbuy  stock I would recommend getting out while the getting is good.  I'm not a  financial advisor and I'm not your advisor._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ #SaveTheMalls for a Good Long-Term (Yes, the Dreaded Word on WSB) Investment Opportunity So, I want you all to listen up and listen up good. We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruin your wallet and faith in the stock market.

You might've heard "you want to invest in your future." Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off "short ladder attacks" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.

With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain "confident" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.

In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers.

**Company Statistics Over the Last Year back from December 2020**

* generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow;
* acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ;
* raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets
* opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;
* returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies)
* Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent).
* Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.
* Extensive, permanent cost-cutting measures were implemented to reduce operating expenses and offset revenue decline. (Leaner businesses are best equipped for a rebound in profits)

**Chart Analysis**

They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future.

**COVID Vaccines**

We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.

**Summary**

I know some of you see the market as a casino. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it hasn't already curved in a better direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?

Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.

[Heres someone way smarter than this retard confirming my beliefs.](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/fx_technical_weekly/2021/02/10/copper-price-outlook-bullish-as-breakout-begins.html)

The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost 3.59% which for copper is pretty fucking big. 

Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.

**AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED 2.74 MILLION SHARES**

[Order book screenshot](https://ibb.co/tMKDwGD)

2.74M shares, 85 Million dollars worth.

While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at -2.5% on a day where copper was +1.5%. Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another 1.5%, and today again where copper ended up +.2% and FCX was for some reason down again at -.8%. Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.

The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up 2.8% since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down 3.2%. That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.

I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with looming inflation and a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.

But since this sub has been infiltrated by FUD-filled, paper handed wrinklebrain-bears, heres why I am on my way to the moon and it’s not too late for you...

*********************** 
**RECAP**

Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla

**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?

Cool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...

**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.

After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.

**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** EPS beats estimates, $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).

 After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. 

Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest. 

But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush...sell limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.   

So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's "Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name." Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9

But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)

**************************************************************************
**CURRENT SITUATION**

That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue...yet $3.9B market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. 

Compare that to LOGI..$2.9B revenue ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). **1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.** 

But CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?

Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day? http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html 

Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)

But pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.

And what also happened today? The P OTUS just [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  

The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more. 

They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away

Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential. 

With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. 

Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least. 

**TL;DR** RGB = Buy. Get on the 🚀. You’ll thank me in a month. 

Or don’t listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast. DYOR
