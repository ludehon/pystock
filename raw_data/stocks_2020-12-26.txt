I'm in college right now, and will end with over $100,000 in debt, and I'm definitely not the only one in this position. Looking at some other posts on here, what sort of impact do you think the student loan crisis will have on the market, and why hasn't anything been done about this crisis yet? This is a huge deal, and it seems like every administration has been sweeping this under the rug.

Nobody is talking about this, and I find it ridiculous that the government is pushing this off like it's nobody's business. Everybody should be worried about this, and I was wondering what you all have to think about this.

Thanks for helping out!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anything critical to say about ARKK? I’m about to sell a few highly speculative positions and I want to reinvest the profit into something with much less risk but still solid potential to beat the s&p 500.

Have made some plays and got into good positions during the crash in March. Currently, my stock plays are into long term or long swings investing. I do know that the market will like the upcoming stimulus bill, yet I feel something is not right. Obviously, coronavirus is still in action and yet the unemployment numbers are rising again. On the bright side the market is still up, especially in tech stocks. The stock market looks too good to be true. I feel that there would be a big correction in the months to come. Any opinions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I dumb for for holding a huge WFC (Wells Fargo) position? Are there any other stocks that are still in 'recovery' but better? I bought a lot of WFC stock at the beginning of april this year and am +- 0$ right now.

Can y'all just share your sentiment on this stock with me? It's 21% of my portfolio while not being up at all, which is a lot for me. Talk some sense into me please.

Upsides in my opinion: 

- SEC might/will lift the asset cap (hopefully in 2021.. pleas lift it)

- Share buybacks soon hopefully

- Corona impact over soon hopefully 

- It's even down 50% from 2019 levels in my own currency (not a huge point)

- I like the new CEO


I'm big on playing recovery stocks still, not just speculating. Do any better ones come to mind?

I might buy a bit of BABA but that's speculation again_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What sector ETFs to invest in? Currently I'm looking for sector ETFs with focus on technologies that have big potential in the upcoming years. I'm mostly interested in Information Technology heavy sectors like Cloud Computing, AI, Robotics, Big Data and Cyber Security. I think there will be an increasing demand in the future. At my workplace for example our management strives to put more and more data into the cloud. Though that does not guarantee the sector ETFs will perform as I'd like to. It is also difficult to find ETFs which combine several of these technologies in one ETF (at least for the European market where getting an ARK ETF is difficult).

What sectors are you interested and have invested already or plan to invest? Do you share my enthusiasm for mentioned sectors or do you think they are currently overrated?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which gaming companies have the best behaviour data? To me, gaming seems like a really valuable data source when it comes to the way people make decisions and react in situations. This sort of behaviour data would be pretty valuable in terms of both product design as well as marketing and predictive AI moving into the future. So I want to invest in a company that generates a lot of user decision data and has the tools to use it. The thing is that I'm not really on the pulse with gaming and I'm not sure where to look. Microsoft seems like the no-brainer with all their studios as well as Bethesda, but I also like ATVI for WoW and the rest of their huge library. Anyone have some insight?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your thoughts on $NOK ? Nokia is close to its lowest since about the year 2000. They struggled with their collaboration with $MSFT in the past for their Windows phone, but they seem pretty active in the 5G and signed a lot of contracts this year (one noticeable with NASA). 

 Notice also that Nokia has a strong R&D department (Nokia Bell labs). So I think they can't go lower.

Anyone on this stock ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about options Im learning a lot more about options but one thing is confusing me. I just read that a majority of options holders dont actually exercise their option and just sell the contract instead. Does this mean that the seller also pockets the difference in share price or just the premium? 

For example, lets say i bought $25 call for a $20 stock, and that stock went up to $30, and then didnt have enough money in my account to cover the 100 shares. Lets also say the premium was $2/share, so total of $200, but when the stock goes up the premium rises to $3. When i choose to sell instead of exercise the option, do i only profit $100 (difference of premiums) or do i profit $600 ($5x100 + $100)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LGVW -> Butterfly Network potential My mother works in healthcare and when I discovered what the Butterfly Network was I asked her if she could do me a favor and ask some of the techs and doctors is they have heard about this to get some information from the people who could possibly use it and she already knew what I was talking about. Apparently multiple doctors and paramedics in that hospital use it and love and swear by it. Hearing it from the actual professionals who use it makes me that much more certain it will succeed. 


I was looking for information from other who may have similar stories from friends, family members, or from using it themselves. I’m really looking to see how far this company could actually go after the merger.

Edit: I should add I do not currently hold any position as I have been waiting for the right time to get in, which seems to get further and further away.

ICLN has been the top earner year-to-date out all ishares ETFs, and there are some clean energy ETFs that are doing even better than ICLN like first trust. 

Are there any concrete reasons as to why this is the case? Are they worth investing in, in your opinion?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Analyze trading/portfolio performance Hey r/stocks, happy boxing day!  


I use TDA and trying to figure a way to analyse my yearly (or whatever range) performance.  There doesn't seem to be a function for this - I can look at realized income for the year but this doesn't show me the true performance as I'll have unrealized gains I want to see too, but this is only available for all-time it seems in the cost basis section.  


I suppose what I'm looking for is: 

* options & stock traded in the time period realized (this is available) + stock bought in the time period and it's unrealized performance, relative to portfolio size.  

* It would also be nice to separate options vs short vs long realized vs unrealized.  


I'm guessing XLS may be the option but this would take me ages to build so wondering if there is anything out there already?

Looking at the holdings in the ETF, when (or if) the airline industry recovers, this could jump in prices.

TSLA, SQ, SE, NET, NIO, PLTR and many others I haven't mentioned and even the ARK **ETFs**, have all 5-20X'd since the pandemic began.

Usually when people like Peter Lynch talk about the elusive 10-bagger stocks... The ones that are supposed to be  rare to find... He usually talks about 5-10 year holding periods. Not 8 months.

A 5-10 year holding period which is a lot more normal than what we're seeing today, would still average to around 30-50% CAGR vs the market average of 9.8%.

Even the best performing stocks of the past decade like DPZ and AMD, you would've had to hold for at least 3-5 years to even get to the lower end of results we're seeing today...

We aren’t competing with each other but this can be a place where we help each other out!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Everything bit of speculation and advice I’ve read this year has been completely wrong. What can we learn from this year? I started trading in April, I caught wind of the hype train just after the crash and started throwing my money into Motley Fools share recommendation service.

These shares are boring and my portfolio floats between -5% and 3.5%

All year I watched tech stocks go through the roof whilst simultaneously reading they will crash any minute, June? Sure, July? Definitely, September? Pop another shrimp or Barbay because we’re going down. 

I kept thinking, ok lets scrap my boring motley fool portfolio and dabble in the tech stocks, but every time I do my logical side told me that’s insane, you’re investing in something that has already eclipsed it’s value not to mention the majority of signs are pointing towards a bigger crash.

I thought I was being smart and level headed by not buying in at what appeared to be the gold rush phase and instead bought Britvic, Burberry, Tesco etc.

But now I feel like all I did was miss out on huge opportunities because I listened to the logical part of my brain and instead of getting even 50% gains I currently sit with 3.5%..

Part of me thinks, I did the right thing and that my boring stocks will get momentum in 2021, but part of me feels like I’ve failed.

TLDR
My main question is.. What do I take away from this year educationally? Should I not listen to the articles and reports on whether it will crash or not?

I sold a covered call 3 days ago that expires Dec 31. Strike is $75.

I put in a limit order to sell 70 shares of FUBO for $44.20.
It will take effect Monday when the market opens.
Fidelity accepted the order after popping up a message warning it will leave me uncovered for that call.

I am unable to write a naked call through Fidelity yet it lets me sell the shares after writing a covered call.

How is selling the shares from under a covered call allowed but selling naked calls not allowed? Aren’t they the same risk?

I thought it wouldn’t be due to infinite loss ie if FUBO skyrockets to $200 unexpectedly before Dec 31

I have made an acorns account but the general consensus I've seen here is that it's a waste of time. Nothing more than an upgraded savings account. I already have an account and was wondering if it really is pointless? People act like you get pocket change from returns. Is that still true today? Have they gotten better?

People here seem to be interested in RH. Mainly because you do the work yourself and you dont have to pay fees. But I dont know how to do the work myself yet.

And yet i find almost everyone "afraid of losing everything" in the stock market so they dont even give a try to it.

NET - Cybersecurity

CRSR , PLTR - New tech IPO that i liked

NIO, PLUG, Enphase - EV / Alternate energy

Pfizer - Covid vaccine


Not sure about SQ, MGNI.

While i like all of these, i wanted to narrow down to 2 or 3 solid choices to invest in as i feel these many are a bit hard to track for me. Most of these have had great runs in 2020, im a bit skeptical if they can keep it up in 2021.

What are your thoughts among these? Which one would you pick? Are there some other stocks that you feel i should look into. Thanks and have a nice day._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EBIX I'm looking to buy EBIX right now. It looks quite undervalued and was researching their business.

They acquire a shit ton of companies (mostly in India). More than 60 percent of all their assets consist of goodwill. As Graham said a 'serial acquirer'. Is this a major warning or is this not that important.

Their investor presentation has also a dedicated page for the CEO with news about him (UGH). CEO looks like a major douche in general. Makes it not look very professional. 

They also recently bought Trimax, India’s Bus Exchange Leader powering Bus roadways of 18 states.

This for a financial company whose major income source is from cash exchange. 

I certainly think India is going to go big in the future but is this company part of it? What are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are Ark Etfs overvalued or undervalued? The Ark Invest Etfs have experienced a lot of growth over the past few months. Are these Etfs overvalued or undervalued in 2021 with a bull or bear market? Can they continue gains or are they due for a correction based on indicators?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where are all the robotic agriculture stocks? I was interested in robotic/automated farming ever since I saw the [farm.bot](https://farm.bot) back in 2017, many other companies like Iron Ox and Sustenir are also very similar in which their goal is to reduce waste (soil, land, water) and automate farming.

&#x200B;

But since I only got into investing this year I have not been able to find a single robotic agriculture stock on the market, does anyone know of any? It would be really helpful and I'd like to see what the public companies are like, it seems like many of these private companies are being slow in their progress

edit: thank you to all the comments it’s surprising that these all exist i’ll be doing my research on them, prior to this post I was literally googling “robotic agriculture stocks” and never found any!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Follow up post from the guy who was drunk with power after his first trading day Seven months ago I posted that I had entered into the arena with a whopping $100 investment into 10 stocks ($10 per stock) and how I was drunk with power after this first day. Y'all seemed to enjoy it so I figured an update almost end-of-year post would be in order. 

Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gkj3ei/i_had_my_first_ever_day_trading_put_10_in_10/

This was my portfolio on that day (plus the gains that day):

* Aurora Cannabis (+68.67%)
* Cronos Group (+11.94%)
* Peloton (+7.33%)
* Zoom (+4.12%)
* Lululemon (+4%)
* Microsoft (+1.45%)
* Amazon (+0.87%)
* QQQ (+0.64%)
* SPDR S&P 500 (+0.45%)
* Apple (-0.59) 

Since then I upped my investment to almost $2k with a total gain of $814.51 so far.

My approach was to sell off some of the volatile cannabis and pandemic stocks, stay away from super involved day-by-day trading, and focus on companies I believe will be good in 5-10 years from now.

My current portfolio (plus total investment and gains so far):

* Tesla ($275 / $462.99)
* Apple ($415 / $130.11)
* QQQ ($687 / $129.22)
* Square ($116 / $44.49)
* Alphabet ($175 / $24.20)
* Microsoft ($200 / $20.62)
* Shopify ($50 / $2.88)

Some notes and mistakes I made:

* Mistake: I bought Shopify much earlier before their big pop because I believe in their business model and leadership, then panic sold when it dropped a bit and since then it went WAY up and I missed out on that.

* Mistake: Same thing happened with Spotify but I haven't bought back in out of spite.

* Mistake: Not putting in more money in general because 2020 has been a terrible year for me financially due to canceled jobs thanks to Covid. It's taking every fiber of strength to not pull out this money too.

* Good thing: staying away from following all the news and pretending I am a genius predictor about which real life news will make a price go up or down.

* Good thing: I still very much enjoy it and would love to continue going this way. I realize for many my strategy is probably a boring conservative one but I am most comfortable with this and I feel it still did quite well for me, mostly thanks to Tesla of course (and who knows where that price will go) but the rest of them went up too still.

edit: formatting/typo_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unique Problem of Too Much Money? So after reviewing my annual Gain/Loss report for 2020, I discovered that every one of my stock sales has been a gain, and 99% of my unrealized gains/losses are all gains.

Gross wages have been \~$50k, and my stock market gains have been \~$40k, for a total of $90k

I've never made that much before, and will be a seller when the markets reopen in January, as I have been holding off on locking in additional profit.

Is there anything I can do to temporarily 'lose' money in the markets thru December to reduce my 2020 taxes? Perhaps buy a solid company that will temporarily drop in share price, only to bounce back within the 1st few months of the new year?

And are there any other negative consequences to making $90k this year?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Websites for info Are there any good websites where we can check the number of issued and authorized shares?

Only made 100 not very happy about that but what are the socks going To the best long-term to invest 2021_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some insights on a company that you've researched that you think most people might not be aware of? Examples:

Palantir supposedly has one of the toughest interview processes out of all the tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and so on. Even though software engineering is a field where it's notoriously hard to determine who is actually a skilled engineer, there is the possibility that PLTR has the best and brightest software engineers out of most tech companies.

Unity software isn't just for video games. But it has potential to be extended to creating all manner of interactive 3D software in general. For example doing VR training simulation for jobs, or VR education (traveling back to ancient Rome in a history class). The bull case would be that Unity eventually becomes the Adobe for 3D interactive content.

Lemonade plans on releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months. Their software is designed in such a way that it is easy to do this. A lot of people who've done preliminary research on Lemonade, believes that they just do renter's insurance and are sticking with that. But 3 months ago they've released pet insurance. They're planning on releasing life insurance next month, and then there's the possibility of car insurance afterwards. The CEO has also stated that he understands the importance of intersecting humanity's (art/design) with tech, and that this is a valuable way to capture one of the most scarce commodities, mindshare. Which is why the "Lemonade app's workflow looks and feels a lot better than going on Geico, Statefarm, Allstate, etc..." (CFO's words, not mine).

Yeah a lot of people may be aware of these facts, but I think most investors *might* not be aware of them. Also I was just trying to give examples._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ These stocks really the future? The stocks CRSP, NTLA, EDIT are genome stocks that seem promising to some due to the expanding market for genome editing in the future. The Crispr gene editing is where the hype is for these are.

Also if anyone on knowledge of the stocks in general please let me know if this is currently worth the investment or not, thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is your opinion on GOEV, another EV company to add to the bubble? Recently Canoo (GOEV) has reverse mergered with HCAC to go public.

Currently, they plan to offer up to 4 different vehicles and are working towards microfactories to start manufacturing in 2022 for multiple options from subscription car services to outright purchases.

Video on their Delivery van: https://youtu.be/IRY9p9qHKgA

Video on their "lifestyle" sedan: https://youtu.be/5FIViMSeigM

They plan to reveal both a truck and "Sports car" in the coming months.

The near thing right now is that all 4 offerings will use the same modular skateboard chassis to reduce overall costs to build and in the end lower TCO for users.

Currently, they pull about 30m from engineering contracts thanks to Hyndai partnerships. They are aiming for 120m in 2021 then adding revenue from sales and subscriptions. Realistically doing better than many current Ex-spacs EVs.

Was curious what most people here thought about this up and coming EV offering. What do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NKE Stocks Hey guys, I’m new to stocks and have a few questions. I’ve been watching the Nike stocks outperform and grow a lot lately, is it too late to buy when a lot of people are saying its at its peak? I’m afraid the upside potential won’t be worth it. Please feel free to leave a comment, thanks for the help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you struck gold on a stock and made a quick $1,000,000 off it, what would your plan be afterward? I like to think about the "what if" scenarios, and this is one that crosses my mind once in a while. I've heard stories of people having a hard time managing their money after winning the lottery, with some people going as far as bankruptcy from their overzealous spending habits. I wonder if that effect would be the same with stocks. I imagine that it could for some, but I think we also have a lot of money savvy people in this community who would multiply it even further.

If this happened to you, would you have a game plan to preserve and grow your wealth? Would you try to keep it a secret, or be selective on who you tell?

Anyone have any stories of this happening to themselves or a friend? How'd it work out?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Starting with partial stock Hi I am just starting out in stocks and I bought partial shares in some companies. My question is should I keep building those partial shares up to full one share first before buying new share or just keep with the partials? I am just doing this for long-term and trying out so don't have big money spending just what I can here and there. I know I won't see big time change with partial or little share but something is better than not playing the game at all right._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Averaging down and DCA Hi all can we talk about Dollar Cost Average? It seems some of you do not quite understand what it can and can not do.

DCA is the idea that you can get a “better” price if you buy a stock once a week for say 10 weeks instead of buying it all as a lump sum on week 1.

This is not true unless very specific circumstances are met:

1. First purchase is at the high

2. The stock enter parabolic ark

3. The stock returns to test the high

These conditions are not often met, in fact often none of these conditions are met. Even in situations where they are, DCA is not the best choice.

Lest look at 3 traders : the fool, the DCA, and Mr.Lambo. Each has 50k to invest.

They all want to invest in a stock currently at the high of 100$

The fool buys his shares, DCA builds 10% position, and Mr.Lambo watches and waits

The price drops! Earnings are a mess, the CEO is snorting coke off the secretaries, and the building is on fire!

While this is going on for the next t months the stock price tanks from 100$ to 45$.

The fool is crying in the corner, DCA builds his whole position with a cost basis of 60$ and Mr.Lambo waits.

Price keeps dropping, hitting 52 week low of 38$, and flattens out, but Mr.Lambo still waits.

All of a sudden news! Our company is making an EV! It’s rally time! Stock jumps to 40$ overnight!

Mr.Lambo grins the next morning and hits BUY! Over the next 3 weeks he DCAs into the stock buying the volatility and keeping the 40$ cost basis.

The price runs up hitting 240$ and all 3 of our investors sell out.

The fool goes home with 70k profit

The DCA goes home with 150k profit

Mr.Lambo goes home with 250k profit and buys a lambo.

Sure our example is idealised, arguably the best case scenario. Arguably the perfect scenario for DCA


In real life our future EV company could have gotten sued out of existence or gone bankrupt. Or it could have never recovered from hitting 38$ and stayed there for 20 years. In which case both DCA and the Fool would go home poor while Mr.Lambo would look for another good stock to buy.

But it illustrates the point effectively, you don’t want to be the fool, and DCA will bring you closer to Mr.Lambo than not. But if you can be Mr.Lambo, or even just DCA from the bottom up you will be far more profitable.

TLDR : buy the dip, don’t DCA from the top down._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rate my investments! Hey guys, I want to get some opinions on my recent investments.

It seems to be universally accepted that 5-10 years for now, fusion power plants (artificial suns) will be producing more power than they consume. 

With the market being focused on future growth to an unprecedented level, shouldn’t we start seeing some fusion power linked tickers begin to gain significant traction?

Does anyone have any favorites?

My next few days off will consist of me digging in to this topic, so any opinions are welcome, negative or positive.

Edit:

“Universally accepted” is too strong phrase. I meant to convey that I’ve seen an uptick in this opinion, and have been looking at what’s going on in France (https://www.iter.org) and now the newer articles about South Korea.
