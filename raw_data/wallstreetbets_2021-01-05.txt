 Mark B. Spiegel went short on ARKK This retard, whose fund has less capital than average WSB member's RH account, went famously short on Amazon and Tesla and basically lost it all. Now he's opened short on ARKK. This is the strongest positive indicator for ARKK I've seen in a while. LEAPS are literally free money and stonks only go up.

Zoox (by amazon) will come equipped with their lidar sensors.

Edit: thanks for the platinum!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Gang: We Need to Complain about Naked Short Selling As we've seen, there's been a lot of fuckery going on with short selling on GME. See these posts

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqf2g8/gme\_gang\_failures\_to\_deliver\_prepost\_wsb\_wsb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqf2g8/gme_gang_failures_to_deliver_prepost_wsb_wsb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Basically, it seems like there is a ton of naked short selling going on and no one is doing anything about it. Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something.

We can submit complaints here:

[https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

There is literally an exact category for this ("Manipulation of a Security" and then select "Abusive Naked Short Selling").

I'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

Now as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.

TLDR: Big money is playing illegal games on GME. We need to bring that shit to light

US Treasury announces new sanctions on Iran's steel industry

https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-treasury-new-sanctions-iran-steel_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 5, 2021 after market close) * The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.

* "I'm totes not dead." Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.

* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.

* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.

* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. 

* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.

* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.

* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share. With a market value of $9 bil, AFRM is sure to be a new meme stock in the coming days.

* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET.

[Well, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjhkkv/back_at_it_again_with_progressive_pgr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I got an unfortunate entry at 1.5 for my Feb 19th calls. Not sure who expected Monday to be one of the worst year openings since 92 but it wasn’t me. On a slow moving stock like Progressive that could be a killer. But I’m still in.

https://ibb.co/cwdpfZf

I plan to average down from my pathetic 1.4 entry after the monster dividend releases with another 4 100c at whatever open mid is after the dividend comes in. If you want a piece of that $4.5 a share, you should get in before close on 1/7 - I had enough leftover cash to get 10 shares.

Note before y’all yolo and lose all your money: This is no longer a slam dunk because of Monday’s clappening but I still think there’s significant upside and why I urged you all to get Feb calls instead of Jan in case this went against us (it did). 97.5c is almost guaranteed but 100 is still on the table.

Current Price: $96.67

Target Price: $102. 

I think they are gonna smash earnings for every reason from the last post with the added confidence a company that releases a near 5% dividend gives in a global pandemic. I think the work-from-home experiment is going to fizzle up slightly, and we are gonna see more people go back to actual work in the coming months, with the headway mostly made in the latter half of 2020. This, mixed in with a solidified political system, should give the market some confidence to do its thing. 

Last year at this time progressive climbed 10% from this time in Jan to Feb 19th. The last two dividends that came out saw the stock climb ~4% and ~6% respectively. If history repeats itself, combined with a good earnings call, we should be able to see a low end of 98 and a high end of ~106 on 2/19. 

According to the WSJ there are 7 buy ratings, 10 holds and 2 sells. The price target average is $100.13 with a low of $87 and a high of $125. 

The volume average yesterday was a million more than normal (2.49m up from 1.44m)

This is for fully paid lending programs like Fidelity has ( they require $250,000 min account but some brokerages require less and some don’t offer the program).

Below is a link I found of hard to borrow stocks. It gives current rates, but if there are other or more complete lists, please provide link.  

The rate Fidelity gives lenders is usually half of what is listed and fluctuates almost daily. 
So if you own the stock it pays a huge interest rate plus any returns.

Wouldn’t it make sense to go through the high interest ones, buy and hold the ones that seem they’d go up?
It seems like an easy way to earn money if you’re buying a lot of stocks anyway, swing trading or long term.
Of course you’d still want to research each stock, and not go off that rate alone.

January options are where the UOA is placed at. Price target for buyout: $32-33. My position: https://imgur.com/gallery/4DTgF2J

Hey autists long time no see I’ve been here for a while and I see no really quality plays out there so here’s one where it involves some good ol’ fashioned DD, some massive unusual options activity and some massive whales that are in a stock that most of you have never heard about, waiting for a buyout that is imminent by January 15 according to the whales’ calls. 

Perspecta is a boomer version of Palantir that has a backlog of military and government IT contracts. Spun out of DXC technologies, the company is massively undervalued at 23 bucks a share where it is currently trading. PRSP has been a target of merger and acquisition in the past but there have only been rumors until Jana partners (the massive whale) took a heavy position. Now who tf is Jana? 

Jana partners specializes in special-situation strategies (aka they park their money in a company and force them to get bought out). One of their successful plays was none other than Computer Sciences corporation, a company that was merged with HP enterprise to make DXC technologies (you see where I’m going with this? They’ve done this before in the same exact sector with the same exact company that was the parent of Perspecta). 

Now, the timing here is key. You wanna buy FD’s with the maximum likelihood of making it. This is where the unusual options kick in. A massive whale has taken a 5500 call position on the january 22.5 strike. More speculative plays have been placed on the 25 strike at 0.7 avg cost (averaging around 200k in premium total in 3-4 sweeps, by my estimate one person has placed 100k of premium). This stock has next to 0 retail interest so I think these options are bought by more sophisticated traders (less than 1000 watchers on stocktwits). 

To make things more interesting, Perspecta has leaked that they’re in the process of a potential buyout: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3643457-perspecta-reportedly-hires-goldman-sachs-to-consider-strategic-options-potential-sale-shares. 

That news “leak” was right after insiders loaded 90 million dollars worth of shares at 18.87 average. To top it all off, all of the major funds that are heavily invested in prsp (Point72, DE Shaw, Maverick Capital etc) have added heavily to their stakes in the past quarter. This, along with the UOA on options and the heavy coiling of the chart, points to a January buyout. 

Perspecta is trading at around 8.2 EBITDA, but average company in this sector is trading at 11.5-12. Given the fact that the CEO has said that shares are undervalued at 25 and that these whales have increased their stakes with an average cost of 23 or so per share, we’re looking at a price target of 32-33 for the potential buyout. The 30 FD’s are currently trading at just 0.1, making this a high reward to risk scenario. 

Last but not least, just look at the chart. The amount of coiling resembles all of the buyouts that we’ve seen (such as FLIR as the most recent example). Heavy blocks have been bought everyday at MOC so someone has been building a large stake.

Edit: I’m shocked to see the prices that these options are going for now. I was merely recommending lottos at 0.1 for 30 strike and 0.4 for the 25’s. The risk reward now is heavily lobsided with these premiums being so high. I blame RH algos that fuck these option chains with everyone hitting the ask. The original uoa was 5500 and they didn’t even raise IV, but the overall volume was around 3k and the IV increased by so much..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME the series _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR Posted this chart a few days ago and some of you retards said TA doesn’t work.

**Building a Launch Pad in 2019 - Supply and Demand**

You have all heard demand is up and supply is down, but what the hell does that actually mean for steel stocks?  To clarify a few points, Global Steel demand has remained largely flat through 2020 and is only expected to rise ~4% in 2021.  Supply is, and has always been the issue here; because of this I will largely ignore the increased demand arguments as they will have minimal impact on current prices unless something major changes like a new infrastructure stimulus bill which is very unlikely short term.  When talking about global Steel/Iron ore prices, you are almost always talking about Chinese Supply/demand.  There are other factors that can affect domestic demand/supply in countries (see India), but for the sake of this DD, I will limit the scope to the Asia Pacific.  With that said, let’s begin.

In January of 2019 the  Córrego do Feijão mining complex in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais collapsed, setting the stage for what will now be called the Great Global Steel Shortage of 2021.

*($VALE bois turn away - RIP Jan 2019 calls)*

https://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/iron-ore-video-shows-exact-moment-when-vales-dam-collapsed/

This disaster not only caused extensive loss of life with more than 240 reported deaths, but it also severely constrained Vale’s iron-ore supply slated for seaborne markets. Authorities ordered a halt in production across many of Vale’s Brazil mines—including at Brucutu, the largest in the Minas Gerais state—output capacity totalling nearly one-quarter of the mining company’s initial 2019 production target of 400 million tonnes was taken offline **(an amount equivalent to around 6 percent of the entire annual global seaborne iron-ore market).** By February, Vale had declared force majeure(unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract) on the sales contracts of several iron-ore qualities, while volatile weather conditions in the north of Brazil also had an adverse impact on the mining company’s iron-ore operations. By the second quarter, Vale’s production levels were a hefty **34 percent lower vis-a-vis second-quarter 2018 levels.** It has also posted two consecutive quarters of losses in 2019, with a $133-million loss for the second quarter (against a $76-million gain in net income recorded for the same quarter in 2018), adding to the whopping $1.6-billion loss Vale notched up in the first quarter.  

Across the ocean in March 2019 Cyclone Veronica decided to stop by Western Australia’s Pilbara Coast and force major local iron-ore mines to shut down production. As a result, prices sailed past the $100-per-tonne mark, before being driven even further skywards during the second quarter after Rio Tinto reported dramatic declines in output. The Australian mining giant’s iron-ore production dropped by 7 percent, to 80 million tonnes, during the second quarter compared to the previous year, as bad weather and operational challenges at their mines continued to weigh heavily on capacity. Rio Tinto also slashed its forecast for 2019 shipments. Fellow mining major BHP, meanwhile, also saw annual output for fiscal 2019 decline by 2 percent to 269.6 million tonnes, again partly stemming from the devastating impacts of Australia’s tropical cyclones.

The two countries represent China’s largest iron-ore suppliers and given the hugely consequential supply problems in Brazil and Australia, China struggled to buy iron ore from the global market as easily as has normally been the case. Data from China’s General Administration of Customs shows that imports declined in June to 75.18 million tonnes, the lowest level since February 2016 and almost 11 percent lower than June 2018 levels. China therefore, tapped its own stockpiles of the commodity to satiate demand from its rampant steel sector. At 115 million tonnes at the end of June 2019, port stockpiles fell to their lowest level in more than two years and were 18 percent lower than 12 months prior. This also meant that only four weeks of inventory supply were on hand for steel producers.  Today those levels are even further diminished to 104.62 tonnes.  S&P Global Market Intelligence, for example, calculated that a 54-million-tonne deficit will transpire for the global seaborne iron-ore market in 2019 and **estimates that it could take another three years before the market returns to a state of balance between production and consumption. S&P chiefly holds the Australian and Brazilian supply disruption responsible for this deficit.**  It's a good thing the deficit only grew to 80million-tonnes in 2020, i mean think of what could happen to the prices!


**Assembling the Ship with Excess Steel - Steel Oversupply, Covid and Destocking**

By March 2020, Chinese steel producers were dealing with soaring finished and semi-finished steel inventories due to a covid infected export market.  Global moves to idle furnaces, and lockdown restrictions were put into effect.  This halt in steel supply put all eyes on China who, short of Feb/March, had been increasing production month over month.  Then something interesting happened, Chinese steel overstocks started to decrease.  By June 2020 those inventories had dissolved, global producers were STILL scaling down furnace production and China for the first time in a decade became a net importer of steel.  Lack of steel inventory, and capped out Chinese production (literally hit an all time production high in October 2020), paired with a global market who had been destocking inventories over the last 2 years, and idled production sent prices soaring.  A rush to increase production internationally was met with hesitation due to ongoing lockdown concerns, increased ore prices, and lack of global supply iron.  Furnace restarts only started happening in early December.  

Hopefully this helps everyone gain an understanding of the current steel situation. The entire supply chain is currently five months behind production, work orders extending out 20 weeks for finished/semi finished steel products, and spot inventories are non-existent.  The idea that we can just ramp up production to fill this gap is met by extreme iron ore shortages.  Recycled scrap has offered temporary relief, but they are also hitting 10 year highs.  Pair all this with a La Niña year in 2021 which will further impact iron supply and 3 consecutive years of destocking; it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is no release available for these prices.

SKLZ 22.5c 1/15_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NVAX Results P3 Results Coming Soon I wrote an earlier post stating that P3 would come out before 2021...which obviously didn't pan out...but based on all possible calculations on modeling, the interim results of P3 should come out soon.  That post is linked here:
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kggkei/nvax_uk_p3_modeling_results_will_come_out_next/

Now, what does this delay mean?  Well, weird thing about vaccine trials because ½ are placebos and ½ are vaccine, the longer it takes the entire group to reach the targeted amount can only mean that we are not getting enough infections in the vaccine group for the target to be reached.  So long delays usually indicate a more effective vaccine.

So, is it possible that NVAX has inside bad info and is just waiting for the P3 to run longer hoping for better results?  
While maybe but we have to consider evidence.  In the P1/P2 trials, NVAX by far had the best results.  NVAX has reported significantly higher CD4 cells and TITERS (or Tits for short) than MRNA and Pfizer.  See graph from RA Capital.  https://imgur.com/a/e9WzTr3

NVAX also named their US trial Prevent-19 which indicates that they believe NVAX actually prevents you from getting COVID rather than just not get sick from Covid.  At least in monkeys they have shown this is true, which is different from MRNA and Pfizer.  

Additional causes of delay could be more detailed analysis of the P3 data from the UK and South Africa, the exact locations where the new mutant variants are from.

So even assuming that NVAX is slightly worse than MRNA and Pfizer but still 90% plus, it would have a significant advantage over the two.  It does not require fucking freezers and there is less of an initial adverse reaction due to it being a protein vaccine.

Here is also an uplifting trial participant essentially stating all his family around him got COVID but not him.
https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/caller-who-had-trial-covid-vaccine-begs-others-to-get-jab-as-his-family-suffers/

I have kept an eye open for some entry points, but typically do not do as much retarded yolo'ing as yall.

&#x200B;

From what I've seen, GME Gang wants us to buy shares, however I am wondering if there are specifics or limits as to how I would go about that. Particularly, if I was only ok getting in at a specific price point and wanted to Sell ITM Puts to do so and collect premium as well, would that impact the battle against Melvin at all (obviously my tiny wallet wouldnt, but lets say a ton of folks did the same).

&#x200B;

For instance, while its fairly dipped right now, if I was to sell a few cash secured Jan15GME20P getting an effective buy price of 16.65 per (including the premium), and buying as long as it stays under 20 by the 15th, how does that affect this on-going battle?

Again assuming the numbers were ramped up to a meaningful number, how does this interact with the Thresholdlist and failure to deliver stuff. How would it play in the larger picture with the pressure u/DeepFuckingValue would put with his 1k contracts on the 15th?

&#x200B;

If these shorts are being dicks and actually selling naked, my limited understanding would say, they could potentially be the ones buying my Puts, meaning they'd need the shares to sell me, and at the same time, they sold DFV's Calls to him, and would need the shares to sell to him, causing further pressure in both aspects, though for mine they could just neglect to exercise, but they'd be out the premium_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What to expect on NIO Day (Deutsche Bank) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB stock interview _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cleveland Cliffs - Fascinating history and classic business success story unfolding!

Fascinating history: (BTW, this company started in 1847!!)

1990s - LTV Steel was CLF’s largest customer.

2002 - LTV Steel and Bethlehem were bought by US Dept of Commerce head Wilbur Ross who strategically purchased the assets of both firms, and leveraged the system to have Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp take on their massive pension liabilities while he got the assets. Names acquisition firm International Steel Group (ISG).

2005 - Ross sells ISG to MT.

2020 - MT sells US ops (read: LTV and Bethleham Steel companies) to CLF.

Once solely a supplier of raw material to steelmakers, CLF now owns nearly all of them—net of massive pension liabilities.

Best part? **There's still time to get in.** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I'm here today to focus in on the Georgia senate runoff results and their effect on TLRY's stock price.

First, to go back to my last post, you might be wondering: **Why TLRY?**

I believe in all of the major weed stocks, however TLRY's merger with APHA has created a **powerhouse**  of a company. The premium APHA will pay for the TLRY reverse acquisition will be a huge help to TLRY's balance sheet. The new company will have a 17.3% market share in Canada, by far the largest. The combined resources of TLRY and APHA will make the merged company a dominant force in the fledgling American pot industry. It did not surprise me why at the time of this post **TLRY has performed the best out of all the major pot stocks in the last couple days. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**TLRY is undervalued.** I'll link my first DD post but to sum it up, TLRY's value, even without a blue wave, is **undervalued.** Morningstar has given them a fair value of $14 per share, Put/Call ratio on the company is .13. **Regardless of what happens in the Georgia Senate election, Wall Street is bullish on TLRY. Technicals and Fundamentals are aligned for a MOONSHOT IN 2021 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**Why are the Georgia Senate runoffs so important?**

The Georgia senate runoffs are the first step of the process. If Dems win (which I will link some good evidence as to why they will) the Senate majority will be enough to get Wall Street giddy. Just look at the moonshot TLRY took after the election of Biden. That was with **no Senate majority.** Imagine the moonshot when the blue wave is complete and the path to legalized pot becomes **much more realistic**. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**What are the chances of the Democrats winning Georgia?**

Momentum for the Democrats has picked up a lot. Voters are excited over Democrat promises for larger stimulus, and moderate Republican voters are turned off to the party after Trump's refusal to accept to the election results.

I was going to write an introduction where I create a metaphor of UnderArmour as a former star high school athlete who drank too much beer and dropped out of school while the rest of the world moved on, but you get it. Look, the point is, UnderArmour spent all of 2020 wrestling with its demons and is ready to get its shit together in 2021.

Remember those days? From 2012 to 2016, UnderArmour had the fitness apparel industry by the nuts. Then Nike, Adidas, and the high school sweetheart with the great ass, Lululemon, all went on to bigger and better things while UnderArmour flamed out.

https://preview.redd.it/1von23nnkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=92fa8df00a847876561ca76546689314c9d11959

I'll talk in this post about what went wrong and what's now going right.

# UnderArmour was an incredible growth story -- what the fuck happened?

The TL;DR for this section is they stopped growing as quickly, lied about it to investors, got a bunch of negative press, and tried to make up for it by overspending on stupid stuff.

1. Misleading investors

The company was proud of its streak of 26 consecutive quarters of 20% YOY growth. So when this trend came to an end, they…kept it going anyway? [Yeah, they cooked their books to make it look like growth wasn’t slowing down, moving revenues from quarter to quarter, and failing to disclose the practice.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835)They went through 3 CFO’s from 2016 to 2017 and they ended up getting sued by investors who lost money on the stock. Ultimately this little fiasco cost founder and then-CEO Kevin Plank his job, though he remains in place as Chairman of the Board today.

The lawsuits remain ongoing.

2. Design issues with their shoes

UnderArmour signed Steph Curry, at the time the biggest star in the NBA, to be the brand ambassador that Michael Jordan was for Nike. The problem was, Curry didn’t even like the product, wouldn’t wear the shoes on the court, and threatened to walk away from the deal at multiple different points. The Curry 2’s, which were supposed to be UA’s Air Jordans, [looked like grandpa’s walking shoes](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steph-curry-under-armour-white-nba-sneakers-internet-memes-jokes/).

When these shoes shockingly failed to sell, Kevin Plank blamed a bad market. Y’all remember when we randomly just stopped buying and wearing shoes in 2016?

3. Ridiculous endorsement deals

College athletic apparel endorsement deals are kind of a big deal in this industry. The University of Oregon’s biggest athletic booster is the CEO of Nike, Phil Knight, and Oregon is well known for its always-changing uniforms. Kevin Plank, as a former football player at the University of Maryland, has created a similar dynamic at his alma mater. But the competition for endorsement deals between Nike, Adidas, and UnderArmour jumped the shark over the past decade. [Here’s a list](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielkleinman/2019/09/13/ucla-most-valuable-college-apparel-deals/?sh=8b2220967624) from 2019.

And a quote: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has expressed the need to be strategic with which universities his company works with. “We have big competitors who are good at what they do,” Plank told the *Portland Business Journal* [earlier this year](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2019/04/05/exclusiveunder-armour-ceo-kevin-plank-talks-final.html). “We’re big enough that we can do any one of these deals, but we can’t do them all.”

That’s a $280,000,000 agreement to put their logo on UCLA uniforms from 2017-2032. This is where we jumped the shark. A little more on this later.

If you’re curious, the full list of Under Armour's endorsement deals is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Under_Armour_sponsorships).

4. UnderArmour – tech company? WTF?

UnderArmour spent a bunch of money on MyFitnessPal and MapMyFitness. The brand has been built around the idea that the clothes are performance enhancing technology… which I guess I can understand. But there’s a difference between fabric technology and electronics. Look, I use the MapMyFitness app, it’s actually pretty cool, but it was a distraction for a textile manufacturer. They’re not a tech company built to lose money, they were a profitable company that tried its hand at app development. Bad idea.

I do believe, personally, that wearable tech will become commonplace and define the consumer space over the next decade alongside 5G and the Internet of Things, and I would expect UnderArmour will jump back into that arena when it's time.  Hopefully the lesson they've learned is that it needs to be streamlined in their primary business model of making clothes.

**Just focus on what you’re good at.**

Before I get into how they’re fixing things, let’s take a look at the same group of comps as in the table above, in terms of % growth over the past 6 months. Whatever they’re doing, it’s working. They’re quietly getting back to outpacing the competition.

https://preview.redd.it/bgce4nzskj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d70cc527148727e48b3a084c434c3de28f1d21d

As I said up at the top, UnderArmour has spent 2020 walking back so many mistakes from the past few years. I think they’ll go back to just selling their clothes, and stop doing other shit! See below.

&#x200B;

# Here’s what UnderArmour has done in 2020 to stop hemorrhaging money:

* **Restructing Plan announced 3/31/2020**

From page 12-13 of the[3Q20 10-Q](https://underarmourinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/7683a1cc-d5bd-49ee-a634-59f9bbc687e7) :

https://preview.redd.it/zgqcx5mwkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2852aaa0d3c588680388b3c7287f4ba02723d13f

As of 9/30, the company had realized approximately $410MM in restructuring costs out of an estimated $550-$600MM. **The remainder of the restructuring costs were completed in 4Q 2020 – remember this when they report earnings in early February.** I believe that, once the company announces completion of the restructuring plan, and provide guidance for 2021, that investors should react favorably even despite what will likely be a poor bottom line figure for FY2020.

&#x200B;

* **A big piece of the restructuring cost is penalties from backing out of endorsement deals, most notably the $280 million deal with UCLA, the largest in history.**
* **Sale of Under Armour Connected Fitness (My Fitness Pal, Map My Run, etc.), completed December 18 for $345 million.**

https://preview.redd.it/pf1kjq6zkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=28c5ca1c74877d39419f4f2e7f3bae49b1e7d61d

* **Shut down their flagship B&M location**

UnderArmour had opened its “flagship” storefront in New York, which was a money loser for the company. They backed out of the lease this summer and took an impairment hit on the books for over $200 million non-cash loss.

* **Completed the purchase of its primary distribution channel in SE Asia in a cash transaction.**

# Project Rock

Under Armour finally might have found its answer to Nike’s Air Jordan branded product line. Project Rock is the new partnership with The Rock, with a pretty badass lineup of products, in my opinion.

Their revenues in Asia and the Middle East fell off a cliff due to global supply chain issues and domestic sales were down due to COVID lockdowns in the USA.  This on top of their already huge restructuring costs, so full year 2020 results will end up being pretty shitty, however I believe investors already know this.

Given the improvement in 3Q, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a YOY increase in revenues in 4Q. Add to that the $215 million in immediately payable proceeds from the December MyFitness sale, I think we ought to see improvement on the balance sheet as well, after 3Q’s increase in short term debt.

https://preview.redd.it/nw5m4e89lj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4d5d15c7a9b09715566fb92d94e9bcdd744f3f

The stock price is suppressed because of those two giant red candledicks in the middle of the graph, and the announcement of the restructuring plan in Q1. Q3 showed dramatic improvement and Q4 has the potential to blow the doors off the place. Proceeds from the MyFitness sale should offset the remainder of the restructuring costs and I believe UA had a good holiday season. (I personally bought TWO pairs of $75 sweat pants.)

**Other shit:**

I’m not going to attempt to come up with an adjusted valuation based on comps because there’s too much that makes Under Armour unique compared to Nike and Lululemon (i.e. lawsuits and restructuring), but NKE trades at 5.81x TTM Sales and LULU at 11.15X TTM Sales, while UAA is trading at only 1.61x TTM Sales. But, I would not be surprised if the share price doubled in 2021.

You might also look at the price history and earnings details from Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports & Outdoors, Hibbett Sports, Sportsman's Warehouse, etc. to see how sporting goods retailers are doing in 2020. They’re all doing well. Sales are way up. While a lot of that is due to large ticket items and online shopping, foot traffic has actually been fairly strong in sporting goods retailers.

**Bottom line:**

I am a big believer in brand equity. UnderArmour’s first product line was one of necessity – Kevin Plank was an offensive lineman on the University of Maryland football team, and realized the world lacked underwear that would keep your ballsack from chafing and wouldn’t bunch up in your ass crack while you’re running. UnderArmour was a pioneer in the compression undergarments and base layers that became popular in sports – hence the name. For many people, the entire lineup of compression base layer shorts and shirts is still known as Under Armours, in the same way every tissue is a Kleenex.

I believe this is a brand that most people still want to wear. While there has been a lot of blame thrown around by management that its presence in retailers like Kohl’s and JC Penney’s has watered down its “premium” brand image, I think that’s stupid. UnderArmour’s problems are its own fault. But, the products have always been marketed well and have been high quality. I still have and wear the first UA compression shorts I ever bought back in 2004.

I think Project Rock is a huge development for UnderArmour that will give them the high-end, premium branded gear that they believe they lost over the course of their growth. It’s cool as shit, and I think it’ll give a nice boost to revenues with a nice margin.

As I wrote above, I believe that the completion of the restructuring plan will demonstrably lead to better cash flows in the future as it will streamline the business. I think Under Armour management is desperate for some good press and will provide some kickass guidance on the February earnings call.

**Is this a pump and dump?**

No, but thank you for assuming I have enough money to fill a bag.

**TL;DR –** Under Armour is undervalued. The company was burning cash like crazy from 2017 to 2019 which resulted in deteriorating financial strength, but in 4Q2020 they completed their restructuring plan and did a little high-end rebranding, which all should improve cash flows in the future and make boomer investors happy, which will cause our long-dated calls to print like a motherfucker.

Buy LEAPS, or buy and hold shares for the next 2-3 years if you’re into that kind of thing.

Positions: 5x UA $20c 7/16/2021 and shares of UA, and I’ll be adding more as my GME ROCKETSHIP brings me that moon money. Hopefully this heightens your confidence in me as your personal financial advisor.

As always, am retard, do your own research and either join me in this play, or don’t, I don’t care.

First off, I did correlation analysis between Biden vote share and early turnout in the runoff as a percentage of November 2020 early vote. The correlation is strong, approximately .45. In other words, the early voting has been remarkably favorable towards the Democrats. I got my data from [georgiavotes.com](https://georgiavotes.com). Here is the link to the google sheet I put the data in. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0)

Secondly, this is small but anecdotal evidences shows rural polling places have not been busy today. The only way Republicans win the Georgia runoff is with huge election day turnout. That is very unlikely in a runoff election without Trump on the ballot.

Lastly, there is polling that shows a wide swath of Republican voters feel like they should boycott the runoff. [https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792](https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792)

Seems like the market has not priced this in so I'm going HAM on calls.

PLUG 40c 1/8/2021

FSR 17c 1/8/2021_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BBBY upcoming ER is the next short squeeze play 🚀🇺🇸1776🇺🇸🚀 Q3 ER Thursday Morning Jan 7. 

**Who is this dying boomer company and why should I care?**

Because of CEO Mark J. Tritton aka the former CMO of Target. By the time he left in October 2019, Target stock went from $65 to $100 during his time and up to $130 by the end of 2019. 

Within the first month, he [ousted almost every senior boomer executive](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/business/bed-bath-beyond-ceo-mark-tritton/index.html) with the exception of the CFO who survived for about 2 month. Meanwhile, you guys are praying with  🙌💎 that Ryan Cohen will lead a revolt against GME Boomerville and their CEO Sherman. Remember Ryan letter? His recommendation is essentially the same strategy that Mark has done. 

**What have they done?**

BBBY is currently undergoing a huge store/digital renovation and continuing their "Omni Always" plan. 170 page presentation or 2.5-3 hour long webcast. 

**Key Points: Investor Day** ([PDF Link](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/2730f3a3-1969-414e-bd30-3fcf49e321d4))

Digital App/Website revamp, Future renovation of Stores, Competitive Pricing in line with others, Non-core banners/assets being sold, 63-66 stores closed by FY 2020, and vendor/rent savings negotiations. 

1.4 million new customers, 6 years younger on average, and younger customers 20% less likely to use coupons.

$375M buyback ([by Q4 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-inc-continues-133000873.html)) for a total of $825M total buyback over 3 years. 

**Quick Rundown of Q2** ([PDF Link](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/45889a21-7ef9-4aa1-abf9-3a55df47b3e9))

30% gross debt reduction, $750M cash flow generation, $2.2B liquidity or ~2x debt, $300M net cash position to debt, +2% gross margin, 89% digital growth (81% Q1), and 6% sales comp growth (first one since Q4 2016)

2800 jobs terminated in late August for $150M annual savings. ([Link](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-announces-next-steps-accelerated))

>The Company expects to incur pre-tax cash restructuring charges of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2020, primarily for severance and related costs in conjunction with these changes, all of which will be expensed in the fiscal 2020 second quarter.

There is a key phase " all of which will be expensed in the fiscal 2020 second quarter." They were fired in August 26 and Q2 earnings were August 29. The $25 million cost is not added to the Q3 results. 

Back to College sales up 21% (Q2) and lasting until Sept 30 with College Saving Pass members (500k) on average having an 14% larger basket on college items.

**Why should I play the upcoming earnings?**

Management has been dropping some hints about their next ER from the Q2 call and Investor Day presentation. (Gustavo Arnal = CFO)

>**Gustavo Arnal**: Importantly, monthly sales for September and on a preliminary basis also show positive comparable sales growth with similar store and digital sales as in the second quarter and accelerated BOPIS trends

>----------

>**Michael Lasser**: ...When you say stability versus -- in September, do you mean stability in September versus August or stability in September versus the entire second quarter?

>**Gustavo Arnal**: ...What we mean stability is consistency in the growth rates. So we're seeing growth rates in September that are similar to the growth rate we've seen in the second quarter, both on a digital growth basis and comp basis.

>----------

>**Simeon Gutman**: ...My short-term is SG&A dollar growth in Q3, how to think about it, if you're able to share given that, I guess, store expenses will be more fully ramped up by that quarter.

>**Gustavo Arnal**: ...What I can say is we're fully committed to continue driving SG&A down as we saw in the first quarter. We also saw some deleverage in the second quarter. And keep in mind that some of the restructuring interventions that we've announced recently are going to start ramping up into the third and the fourth quarter. 

Similar growth in both store and digital for the 1st month. College Savings Pass”(500k student) lasting until Sept 30 who on average have a 14% larger basket for college stuff. Millions in SG&A reduction as 2800 people are fired.

>**Investor Day Presentation**

>**Gustavo Arnal**: Momentum has continued in the third quarter. We are seeing through September and October comp sales growth in the mid single digits with the same strength in our digital business and it is coming at a healthy margin and a healthy cash flow (pg 139)

Another hint about the 2nd month of continued growth in comp sales and digital sales but what about the 3rd month? That is pretty much a guessing game but the 3rd month is November aka Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday. They position themself for the holiday season back in late Sept with a same day shipping partnership with Shipt and Instracart. 

>Random Info. Shipt was acquired by Target in 2017 as an independent subsidiary and Mark was the former CMO of Target

**Short Interest**

76% of the float has been shorted or about 57-60% of the OS on Dec 15. Likely has only increased because the stock has gone down 5-10% since Dec. Recently in Q4, "D. E. Shaw" bought 2.1 million shares bringing them to 6.1 million shares (5.1% ownership). Small insider buys in the last couple months. 

**TLDR**: Continued Growth in Comp/Digital Sales for Sept/Oct, 2800 jobless people, $250M non core assets to be sold in Q3, $375M buyback by the end of 
Q4, 76% of float shorted as of Dec 15,  and same day shipping before holiday

**Positions**: It's your money. You decide but pick up a couple shares to help the squeeze if possible. 

**TLDR of the TLDR**:“BUY BUY BUY Y" - BBBY gang motto 🚀🚀

# Process

I posted this strategy on Quantopian and Quantconnect a couple months ago but thought y'all might like it.

This algorithm searches this subreddit looking for posts related to the stocks SPCE, LULU, CCL, and SDC (these stocks are popular here). Then it conducts a sentiment analysis of the comments in the identified post and stores the values in a data frame. 

Stocks are ranked by those most popular to least popular, and then automatically bought in proportion to their relative popularity (or sold in proportion to their relative un-popularity).

Retail investor participation in the market is at an [all-time high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-investor-exposure-to-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-td-ameritrade-2018-01-08), and there are plenty of simple stock analysis tools to help small investors make informed decisions. If the general sentiment from retail investors is up, then they could be purchasing the underlying equity.

Here are the links to the [csv file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qydhy62v08tw4em/Reddit_Sentiment_Equity.csv?dl=0) generated from the [Reddit sentiment analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0) program.

# Results

After just a few months: $12k, 9% max drop. I recognize this is too short a time to know if this is a good long-term strategy. Turns out the wild hive mind of r/wallstreetbets either has blessed foresight or is great at pumping stocks.

What stocks should we do next to max those gains?

*****

> * Stock futures were largely flat, following the worst start to a year since 2016, which was also the last time the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted January losses. Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels, the Dow and S&P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)

*****

> * Wall Street’s attention will in large part be focused on today’s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, must beat GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to capture the majority for their party. (CNBC)

*****

> * Senate runoffs in Georgia will shape what Biden can achieve in the White House (CNBC)

*****

> * The Institute for Supply Management is out with its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET, which is expected to fall slightly to a 57 reading. Meanwhile, automakers release their fourth quarter sales figures for 2020 throughout the morning, with analysts surveyed by Edmunds expecting an overall 5.7% drop on U.S. sales compared to the same quarter in 2019.

*****

> * Shares of China Telecom (CHA), China Unicom (CHU) and China Mobile (CHL) were soaring in premarket trading after the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer plans to delist the three Chinese telecommunications giants. It’s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier, which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)

*****

> * Carl Icahn, in remarks to CNBC’s Scott Wapner, warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. “In my day I’ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks, but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,” the billionaire investor said. (CNBC)

*****

> * Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: ‘Dow could easily tack on another 10% to 15%,’ but warns of a near-term setback (CNBC)

*****

> * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another national lockdown for England on Monday, a strict public-health measure he said he hopes will help contain a new, more contagious strain of coronavirus. The U.K. has now reported more than 50,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, and Johnson said deaths are “up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.” Johnson said he believes the country was entering its “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 due to the rollout of vaccines. (CNBC)

*****

> * Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount (Associated Press)

*****

> * New York has discovered its first case of the coronavirus variant initially found in the U.K., according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

*****

> * Just 1% of Californians immunized amid slow vaccine rollout (Associated Press)

*****

> * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed back on the suggestion to change the dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines, saying the currently available data does not support such alterations. The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However, with “adequate scientific evidence,” the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks “may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.” (Reuters)

*****

> * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it’s proving controversial. Here’s what we know so far (CNBC)

*****

> * Ahead of today’s crucial runoff election in Georgia, Republican Sens. Loeffler and Perdue were recipients of a late surge of donations from the real estate and financial industries. Their Democratic opponents, Warnock and Ossoff, had otherwise held advantages in fundraising during the races. (CNBC)

*****

> * At an outdoor rally in Georgia, Trump declared he intended to “fight like hell” to retain the presidency and appealed to GOP lawmakers to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when they meet Wednesday to confirm the Electoral College vote. Trump spent much of his speech complaining about his election loss, which he falsely and repeatedly claims he won. (AP)

*****

> * Supporters of Trump are planning to protest the expected Biden Electoral College vote certification with demonstrations Tuesday night and Wednesday in the nation’s capital. The National Guard has been mobilized to keep the peace in Washington. Trump has encouraged the protesters, tweeting Sunday he will be there. (NBC News)

> * The joint venture to disrupt health care created by Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is being disbanded after three years. Known has Haven, the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care. The three companies are likely to collaborate informally in the future on health-care initiatives, but the formal end of Haven may be an indication of how challenging it is to dramatically improve American health care. (CNBC)

*****

> * The chief executive of Qualcomm (QCOM) is retiring later this year and will be replaced by the chipmaker’s president, Cristiano Amon. CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who is 52, took over the job in 2014. His departure comes as the company stands to benefit from the broader rollout of 5G networks. Shares of Qualcomm have gained 96.7% since he became CEO.

BILI | QS & Other Stock Market News [01-05] **Stocks take a plunge to start 2021, so is this the start of the next stock market crash? Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia [Election](https://ibb.co/VtxQdmk) of Today, while the US Congress is [scheduled](https://ibb.co/wzqV8PW) to certify the electoral results tomorrow, which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that. Yesterday both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HByWLx9) and the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/k04mKGP) finished down almost 1.5% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cht7kGV) did slightly better finishing down 380 points, finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016, as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/rmHnjZj) rising more than 4 points or 18.5%, finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn’t been touched [since](https://ibb.co/mznW197) after the November elections.

We saw most of the companies losing ground [yesterday](https://ibb.co/h8sJKh7) with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50-day moving average finally going down below 60%, which in my opinion is a good & healthy correction & consolidation for the stock market, as the volume did pick up after the year-end slow markets.

Yesterday 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/j4MprMG) finished in the red with Real Estate, Utilities & Industrial losing more than 2.4% while the only small gaining sector was Energy. Meanwhile on a [FACTOR](https://ibb.co/Lzzvr0N) basis the market was more neutral, with most of the groups finishing pretty flat, but the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/v3Yk8PG) from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left & right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla, Zoom, Walmart alongside the semis & materials.

I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts, as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very [high](https://ibb.co/PDHM90J) to end the year, as we ended the year with more than 46% of investors having a bullish sentiment, pretty near the 1-year high of 55% achieved after the election in November. 

We didn’t receive many important economic data yesterday, as the construction [spending](https://ibb.co/kXFvYvT) came in at a .9% increase in November, slightly lower than expected and the previous month, but in aggregate it was an increase of 3.8% year/year, while the Manufacturing PMI [index](https://ibb.co/Xkpj85W) came in at just over 57, better than expected and the previous reports, with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/FDyT24L) we receive auto sales numbers, the Redbook chain store sales & the manufacturing index from the ISM.

Meanwhile, today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings [results](https://ibb.co/4KZBBBW) as this will pick up starting in the middle of January.

In some other stock market news, we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40% [yesterday](https://ibb.co/0GpXy3f) after they filled to sell more than 300M shares, as this will significantly affect the [shares](https://ibb.co/L0CGPkV) float and the dilution of the company. This is a very high risk with most of the high-flying stocks right now, as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital, regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders. You can also see this with [Bilibili](https://ibb.co/tYspLZj) that just filled for a $2B offering in Hong Kong.

We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record [CAPEX](https://ibb.co/HN2zPGF) spending for this year, as they [continue](https://ibb.co/m9s85DC) to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market [share](https://ibb.co/DLZ0jd6) in foundry business this year, which has seen a 24% increase year/year to over $84B.

Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange reversed its [decision](https://ibb.co/Ry4gfLM) on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down, but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after-hours, while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those, but pretty much the whole [industry](https://ibb.co/7QcRM9s), saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China. 

In the auto-industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a [merger](https://ibb.co/mv4Kp3x) with PSA. The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world’s fourth largest carmaker. They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out, as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto-market in the world, China.

So, let’s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1% in the first trading day of the year. 

You can see this has happened 18 [times](https://ibb.co/CPkZzP8) with the Dow Jones, but this has led the index to finish down only 40% of the time in January and for the year, while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 [times](https://ibb.co/MPHN34j), but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42% of the time, with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis.

So, I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020, portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new [lockdowns](https://ibb.co/88pj0Yj) just like they started in the UK, which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day. I don’t think there is any crash possibilities, but a correction or pullback is possible in the short-term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps, restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year.

So, let’s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bmsPDqL) seem to be pointing to a red open, with the, while the rest of the world is pretty [mixed](https://ibb.co/xLfGFHT) with Japan, France and Germany down, while China & Hong Kong are up

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Elon Musk only $11b off overtaking Bezos and becoming the richest man in the world. Papa Musk now worth twice as much as Papa Buffett In the battle of the hair transplants vs non-transplants, the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?utm_source=url_link) shows Elon ($175b net worth) about to overtake Bezos ($186b net worth) as the king of the tres commas club.

Buffett all the way back at $86.6b (time to BTFD on Buffett??)

Jack Ma at $50.1b, although much of that will probably be spent on his funeral when 🍯 🐻 finally announces his death.

Time for WSB to pump that price up - just need one  “stock price is too high” tweet from Elon, a capital raise to dilute the shares and perhaps another split so we can hit $420 once again and he will be the richest man on this planet.

Perhaps after he becomes the richest person alive, he can finally concentrate on helping Tesla become more profitable than a kids lemonade stand.

What part of "listen up boys, we are going to war with Melvin and his cocaine fueled buddies, some of you may die. Are you in?" did you not understand?

This isn't a goddamn walk in the park where your wife and her boyfriend put you on a leash and tie you to a post so they could go snuggle under a blanket in the woods. ITS FUCKING COMBAT. You know what happens in combat? SOMETIMES YOU FUCKING BLEED. I don't know how the fuck you guys are smart enough to open reddit but so braindead that you can't see that your tiny Trump hands are being mushroom stamped into submission by the big boys. 

This is **Catholic School The Play** casted by Melvin as the priest and all you dipshit retards are signing up to be the altar boys. Why don't you just bend over right here and willingly spread your ass cheeks until all your spare change falls out of your pockets?

Stop being so scared of a couple red days. Our brothers in arms over in Palantir have been fighting by our side for like a month and all you dumbfuck paper handed bitches start crying after taking a few shots. Get used to some red. Like your wife's boyfriend says, "I don't mind ketchup on my hot dog as long as the bun is tight." Well we know you small peckered bitch boys didn't cause anything to loosen up so we know he's telling the truth. Guess fucking what? THIS GME BUN IS SO FUCKING TIGHT IT'S GONNA SQUEEZE LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE. Yeah, get ready for some blood red ketchup and keep jamming it forward. If you can't do that, go check out r/investing and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. 

What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can't even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. 

Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy's fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say "hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP. Wow, I know 2 of those letters! All in for these FD's" while we are pissing in a bottle and preparing to jerk off for the 8th time since breakfast. 

What we don't have in brains, we also don't have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost for your wife to be exclusive to you. 

Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don't even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN.

I’m no expert, I’m just here to explain why I have yolo’d my account into Wish.com shares and calls. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence. 

Part 1: The Basics

Wish.com went public on December 16th and nosedived from $23 to $17.45 over the course of about 2 weeks. Wish has rallied over the past two trading days despite the market being red overall. I think the stock is way oversold and potentially hit its bottom last Thursday. Let me spit some quick facts about the company:

- Amazon and Alibaba both offered $10 billion to acquire Wish in 2015. This is obviously prior to the boom e-commerce has received from Covid. Wish’s annual revenue was $300 million at this point. 
- Revenue in 2019 was $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than Shopify in 2019 for reference. 
- Founded by former Google and Yahoo programmers and recently appointed a former Square exec to their board of directors
- Wish had over 90 million monthly users in 2019, and I believe that number has gone up considerably by now. 
- Most downloaded shopping app of all time with over 500 million downloads.
- Serves over 100 countries with 3 million transactions a day.
- No debt and over 1-2 billion in cash
- In spite of further lockdown news today, Wish went up. I believe this stock is now being recognized as a stay-at-home stock, yet should perform well post-covid due to the longevity of the e-commerce industry as a whole. 
- Although Wish is an American company, many of its merchants are Chinese. I believe Wish might gain in the short term in response to uncertainty over Alibaba’s monopoly investigation. 
- If none of the above has gotten your cock hard yet, Palantir Co-Founder, John Lonsdale, owns 59 million shares of Wish.   

Part 2: Data

Data is the new oil bitches. Wish has an absolute fuckton of users, and what sticks out to me is that the majority of purchases made on wish are items that weren’t searched for by the buyer.  These are items recommended by Wish’s algorithm. Only about 15%-20% of purchases made on wish are made through the buyer performing a search. Wish is very effectively using the data they collect to recommend the right products to the right people. If you don’t see the value in that, then fuck you.

And may I remind you that John Lonsdale, Data God and Palantir Co-Founder, owns 59 million shares of Wish. 

Part 3: The Cons

The biggest criticisms I’ve seen of Wish is that the product quality can be poor and the shipping time can be poor. These are valid points, however I believe the leadership of this company will make strides in improving upon those two problems, especially when you consider that they just raised a billion dollars in their IPO. Additionally, I’ve seen positive reviews regarding their refund policy. This obviously does not excuse poor product quality and shopping time, but the numbers don’t lie. People are buying shit on Wish. There is a market for cheap, low quality shit and Wish is capitalizing on it hard. If you think Wish is a garbage company, just remember that amazon and alibaba both saw massive value prior to all the growth Wish has had in the last 5 years. 

Once the quiet period is over and Wish releases its first earnings report since they’ve gone public, I’m anticipating a huge run.

Does anyone have a solid reason for the downturn? Or have any input on thier own beliefs? I still believe in this company, but I have no idea why the crash happened, other than paper hands taking short-term profits.

389 institutions hold shares in The Macerich Company. 

Institutional investors and hedge funds have recently made changes to their positions in the business. Aperio Group LLC boosted its position in shares of The Macerich by 48.8% in the third quarter. Aperio Group LLC now owns 407,430 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $2,766,000 after acquiring an additional 133,601 shares during the period. Advisor Group Holdings Inc. increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 75.7% in the second quarter. Advisor Group Holdings Inc. now owns 149,133 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $1,338,000 after buying an additional 64,243 shares during the period. Vanguard Group Inc. increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 2.3% in the second quarter. Vanguard Group Inc. now owns 19,822,696 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $177,811,000 after buying an additional 447,029 shares during the period. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 102.5% in the second quarter. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp now owns 62,834 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $564,000 after buying an additional 31,807 shares during the period. Finally, Bank of New York Mellon Corp increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 1.2% in the second quarter. Bank of New York Mellon Corp now owns 2,164,136 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $19,411,000 after buying an additional 24,664 shares during the period. Institutional investors own 83.77% of the company's stock.

The top institutional shareholder in the company is Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board with over 24.56 million shares valued at $166.78 million. The investor’s holdings represent 16.43% of the MAC Shares outstanding. As of Sep 29, 2020, the second largest holder is Blackrock Inc. with 18.09 million shares valued at $122.8 million to account for 12.10% of the shares outstanding. The other top investors are Vanguard Group, Inc. (The) which holds 16.27 million shares representing 10.88% and valued at over $110.44 million, while State Street Corporation holds 4.77% of the shares totaling 7.13 million with a market value of $48.4 million.

The biggest takeaway for me is Blackrock ownership - BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with $7.81 trillion in assets under management as of end-Q4 2020 - these guys know value. 

If you don’t know who $MAC is:

Macerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, management, development and redevelopment of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.  Macerich owns some of the nation’s highest-earning malls, including Tysons Corner Center in Northern Virginia.

https://wamu.org/story/20/12/18/despite-the-pandemic-and-popularity-of-online-retail-shoppers-are-still-flocking-to-tysons-mall/

$MAC is an owner of a multitude of well-positioned, high-end shopping centers. 

We aren’t talking about your local mall that is half vacant and has been for years, their properties are high-end, destination attractions:

https://www.macerich.com/Leasing/Find 

The low interest rates benefit REIT’s and allow $MAC to do deals like this:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/real-estate/commercial/preit-macerich-fashion-district-control-bankruptcy-gallery-20201217.html%3foutputType=amp

I know what you are thinking, malls are closed, no one is going to bricks and mortar, but as you saw above at Tyson’s Corner, people are out and shopping. 

Pent up demand + stimulus = profits.  

As of October 7th all 47 of the Company's major retail properties nationwide were fully open for business, now that LA County has approved indoor mall reopenings. 

In LA as of 12/27:

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_ShoppingCenters.pdf

REIT’s - Real Estate Investment Trusts - some of the most beaten down stocks by the pandemic and this one, I believe has significant upside from its current price level.

What I like about $MAC is this:

Rent collections continued to improve, with collection rates increasing to approximately 81% in October of 2020 and 80% in the third quarter of 2020, up from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020.

Mall portfolio occupancy, including closed centers, was 90.8% at September 30, 2020, compared to 91.3% at June 30, 2020.   

Mall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio was $718 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $800 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. This sales metric excludes the period of COVID-19 closure for each tenant.

Average rent per square foot increased 1.8% to $62.29 at September 30, 2020, compared to $61.16 at September 30, 2019.

Approximately 93% of the square footage that was open prior to COVID-19 is now open and operating. 

Cash receipts continued to improve, increasing to approximately 80% in the third quarter of 2020 from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020. 

As of November 2, 2020, the Company has collected approximately 81% of rent for October. 

With continued improvement in operating cash flow, liquidity also continued to improve. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased from $573 million at June 30, 2020 to $630 million as of September 30, 2020.

Bottom line, this company is getting healthier and owns prime real-estate, with stimulus and vaccines upon us - the animal spirits are ready to be unleashed. 

What I like THE MOST above the value is the potential short squeeze that is coming (re: $GME and dare I say $TSLA). 

Short Interest (Shares Short)
80,670,000

Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)
14.7

Short Percent of Float
58.46 %

Shares Float
137,990,000

Lastly, I put this together for everyone that has said I’m just a “steel pumper”.

I’m anything but. 

I believe Tech has had its year in 2020. 

2021 will be the year of finding value with all of the current stretched valuations. 

Commodities, travel, shopping, real estate - they will all benefit from a weakened dollar, vaccines, stimulus and low interest/borrowing rates.

# Intro/Disclaimer

yeah its long as fuck, but read for tendies. If its too long suck a bear dick and move on. This is real analysis of the business model, not just a bunch of emojis. It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community. This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you're not picking winners. Its the "picks and shovels" play of electrification and renewable energies. I'll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come.

This is my second DD post on now $MP, formerly $FVAC, and i'm back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre-merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future. **There has been too much really shitty DD** from both bulls and bears **on this company**where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company, their business model, and the future.

First - read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I'm not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I've already written. Read that first then come back:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac\_dd\_evchina\_tension\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac_dd_evchina_tension_play/)

That post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE's but this one i'll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine.

Second - no I'm not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre-merged SPAC my average on my shares is about $14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I'm not selling any of them. Also, as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer, so while I'm not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us. I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative. Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de-bunk them as most don't really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit.

# Background of NdPr

While the company produces as basket of Rare Earth, the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV's and electrification. These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work. To put it simply, at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets. Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don't believe me or want to learn how watch this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c):

yeah i know you didn't watch that video, but just imagine you did and now believe me.

However, because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology. This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables. First, electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV's in the future, and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well. Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets. The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies. Wind energy (and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy) work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity. Wind power doesn't work without electric generators which don't work without magnets. In addition, wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive (PMDD) technology from the current Gearbox doubly-fed induction Generator (DFIG). Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity. These new generators require stronger magnets, thus more magnetic material. Read more about that [here](https://www.goldwindamericas.com/pmdd):

**TLDR**: They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Special Rocks no replacing. Need special rocks.

# $MP's expansion plans

A lot of bears like to bring up the fact that $MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they're correct... for now. Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides (REO's), which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets. Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so $MP is forced to send their material there, but that is why the went public. The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on-site REO facitility, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started. They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over $500M on hand at the end of Q3, and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream. There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow, yes I'm talking to you $QS bagholders... that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner

Why would they want to move downstream when they're already profitable??? Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us. Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it. Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model, the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE's in America. They have not decided/disclosed their plans for this, whether it is through construction of an onsite facility, an acquisition, or a joint venture, but it is in the plans. This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company. I don't have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to "mine-to-magnet" and "restoring the REE supply chain to America."

What does this mean for the company? as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone, but it gets even better. This can be shown in their in-house calculations of their 2023 adj. EBITDA target of $252M

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/7eiobfp84f961.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=a41e24edbdadb0b1e55ec53ae92f7c4109f19b8d)

it is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility. Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve, but next I'll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE.

**TLDR**: downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company.

**TLDR of TLDR**: Special rock get more special. Get more tendies for special rock.

# Business model of mining companies and why $MP has insane growth potential

*\*\*\*This is the most important part of this long ass post, if you read one section, then read this\*\**

A big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works. A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY, which I know is not as exciting as a tech company, BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders.

What i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates. Given a mine at a fixed production volume, the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar. What i mean by this is the cost $MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product. However, the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product, which is what varies the most. An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation:

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ijzcpgmc4f961.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8bbfb1ba67f429886dc4abb6b6f1a9ef5862db1)

That value of Production cost (at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates) will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor, energy for machinery, administrative costs, etc. While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize. It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore, dig it into dump trucks, pay operators to refine into ore, etc. Don't trust me, look into how steel companies operate, like this sub's favorite $MT. The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE's, which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT. Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011-current:

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/commodity\/neodymium](https://preview.redd.it/q1ytv5ch4f961.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b5ddfa993ccb75cdf3638d13cbdf2748ccb7c9c)

\*\*If you are an investor in $MP (which you should be) this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company. \*\*

Allow me to disect that graph a little bit:

1st Peak: From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010/2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous $FVAC post i linked above. China lowered exports by 40% and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines. That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog. that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business. I'll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and $MP.

2nd Peak: This peak (late 2017) is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE's and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post. The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again.

3rd peak: where we are now. This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption, more from asia and Europe than the US **and** because china has been threatening to use REE's as a political tool again, which again i referenced more in my last DD post.

However going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I'd like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate. MP, like any other commodity play, relies on the supply-demand dynamic of the sector, and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth. This will result increased prices per ton, but MP's costs stay the same. This is the beauty of the company, as the price goes up their margins go up too! MP and market analysts predicted over a 100% growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years:

This graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand. THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING. What does this mean?? There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don't know what that will mean then ask your wife's boyfriend about supply-demand graphs from their economics class. The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand, so they will be able to increase their prices. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MP'S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME. So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion? MP's margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply-demand imbalance. Now what does that mean for you?? that means $MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow.

What does that mean for MP? That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet. They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year. They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT. In fact, $MP ended Q3 2020 with $507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions. Okay, i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power.

**TLDR**: Supply demand imbalance (with geopolitical tensions as a wild card) will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company.

**TLDR of the TLDR**: People want more special rock more than can make special rock. People give you more tendies for special rocks.

# Why Supply won't be able to scale up as fast

A very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I'd like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD. This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect. Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already, however this is where the timetables of that come into play. Simply put supply can't go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine. If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn't a fast path in because the companies can't just decide to go into the business and then go to the "REE refining machinery store" and buy the equipment and have them get set up. All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants (REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out) has a long path in order to reach the optimum design. Ill outline the gist of this here:

1. Lab Scale Testing: This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation. This is when the deciding of the catalysts, solvents, additive chemicals, etc is done in order to decide **what to do** to the ore to get the best product.
2. Pilot Plant Design and Testing: This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions, determine control points, etc. This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step.
3. Full scale design and building: This is when the full size, real-deal machinery is designed and constructed. But again, there is not "REE refining manufacturing store" to get much of this machinery. Refining plants are custom designed (minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that) and custom built. These are custom designed, custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material, area, volume, and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24/7 continuous operation. The 24/7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously. The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect. That means it takes even more time to produce.
4. Permitting and Certification: Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining, but they still can't start operating despite the entire operation up and running. In the US, now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in. Mining and refining operations don't operate under OSHA rules and procedures, they get to operate under OSHA's much meaner, expensive, and safety prone brother, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, inspect every single moving part and permit them, and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations. Now due to the stimulus bill's provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be (or already has been) told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked, but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time. In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field.

Now you've seen how long it would take to get up and running, but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these? Larger Chemical or mining companies (Dow, DuPont, Chemours, BASF, etc) looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house. Smaller, non-conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design/consulting firm to come in and do the designing, write the procedures, and train the production engineers and operators. That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know-how to design at the rate needed to scale up.

**Here is what is important,** any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land, designing the plant, buying the machinery like excavators, dump trucks, pipelines, pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery. Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least. Then once all that upfront capital is sourced, plant designed, people trained, etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow. It is only a matter of time for $MP to have significant domestic competition, but by the time these operations could begin operating $MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have. **$MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors**, even though competition will come.

**TLDR**: At current outlook supply growth won't match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it'll take years to start operating and even more years to match $MP's ability.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Not enough people finding special rock. More people want special rock than can get special rock. They pay more for special rock.

# $MP's competitors, both domestic and international

A large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US, and they are 100% correct.... but it won't matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play, not a tech company. They make magnets, their revenue will depend on the price of their product. Buyers from this are not looking at $MP like you would look at $TSLA vs. $NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other. There isn't brand recognition, increased utility, or consumer favorites in magnets, they're fucking magnets. Think about it like another commodity, lumber. If you go to $HD to buy some wood you aren't staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it. You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood. A timber company isn't outright threatened by another timber company popping up, as long as the demand-supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected. That is why it won't matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up. As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money. Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I'll discuss the international and domestic competition, but Ill explain more in depth why i don't give a shit about them.

Domestic: The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned. If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re-purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing. However if you analyze their production numbers you'll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level $MP will. They plan on refining 15,000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55% REE concentration, which leaves an estimated 8,250 tons of REE per year, of which 22% is NdP (all their numbers not mine), which leaves annual production of 1,815 tons/yr. These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential, but its scale is not quite the scale of $MP. $MP is predicting a run rate of 6,075 tons/yr of NdPr, so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1/3 the size of $MP annual production volume. A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play, but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don't want to slander that ticker too much. However, again, these are commodity plays, $MP having competition, even domestic, doest really affect their business plans or bull case. Additionally, the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours' location in GA, but getting milled in Utah, so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that $MP won't have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete. the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent, but its market cap is $516M at close 1/4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand $MP had at the end of Q3 2020, $502M. That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor, if its even worth investing in.

Other emerging domestic competitors: [link to article explaining them all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-projects-factbox/factbox-rare-earths-projects-under-development-in-u-s-idUSKCN2241L6) Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status. These companies will be coming online, but won't be profitable for a while and won't be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer.

International competitors: Lynas Corp. This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non-China production capacity. They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn't as clear or easy as in the US. They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company. In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies.

International competitors: all the china ones. yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection. Once the supply chain can go "mine to magnet" many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government. In addition, $MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE's and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE's.

**All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030. Even with these companies coming online $MP is still positioned for incredible returns.**

**TLDR**: Yes competition is coming, but there is already competition. Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Others find special rock. Your special rock still worth many tendies. You still get many tendies.

# Why this is NOT molycorp 2.0

The most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine $MP operates used to be run by Molycorp, which went bankrupt. However if you read into that transaction it really isn't that scary. Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation. Molycorp operated during the 2010-2011 peak of REE's when china restricted supply. Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO's (I know this is $MP's plan but don't get scared yet). Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had $1.7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability, but the subsequent REE price collapse when china "turned the taps back on" to the world supply caused them to not afford operation. The site then changed hands back and forth until it was [bought by $MP's current management for $40M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp). They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before. Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3.2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did:

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/c53c5a8w4f961.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5d9f65cad202807588fe516b399ca954cef08a)

They got to buy over $1.7B worth of investments for $40M and have proven they have turned those investments into operating profit. In addition, previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts. $MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility. In addition, the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now. Back then there wasn't the tailwind of increasing EV adoption, or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE's. Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn't have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry. There is bipartisan support on all levels, i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post, but since then - and this is big and shows the scale of gov support- [THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD $800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/miners-laud-800m-rare-earth-fund-in-omnibus-bill-61939620)! Molycorp didn't have anywhere close to this level of government support. And again, the pentagon invested $9M into $MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO's as a matter of national security.

# Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency

People who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Biden (or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green) has said he supports REE mining multiple times [source](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B). His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China. Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV's and clean energy. REE's are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden's plans there is no way he turns his back on this company.

# Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with $MP

The one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all $MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in $MP. Many view this as a negative, but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production. A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate, which would give MP no customers. Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15% of the world's REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china, which is huge. In fact, China removed their 25% tariff on importing REE material, read this [source](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2104418-china-to-remove-import-tariff-on-us-rare-earth-ores) as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can. Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP, starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/fnvxv8415f961.png?width=2494&format=png&auto=webp&s=67a5db04a13d3e1c32d0f20de57b0f291e5b841a)

China is not likely to fuck MP and stop buying their concentrate as it will hurt china's wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically. China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now, but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not.

Also, if Shenghe doesn't buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP. they wouldn't be allowed to sell them on the market, the shares would just disappear, so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers.

# Mine Life discussion

Their S-1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left. That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material, which they stated they plan on doing. in addition, if they for some reason don't find more mineable ore on their land and don't buy more land with ore, then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn't the digging out of the ground, it is the milling.

# TLDR

$MP will to the moon over the next few years.

Postions: shares for virgins and LEAPs for chads.

&#x200B;

Edit: addressing $QS collapse today (1/4 after a -40% on $QS) and the associated EV infrastructure. I think $QS hitting the shitter, well, predictable. People flooded to it as a result of attempting to find a parallel way to play the rise of EV's without understanding the company. $QS is a solid state battery technology, but I have never held a stake in it because, well, all it is is an idea or concept. It fell today as a result of a report criticizing the basis of its technology and I have to agree, the tech is not proven and even if it works as advertised there is a question of whether it could ever solidify its valuation, even after its collapse today. Solid state batteries MAY be the future, but for now their real place is in university and R&D laboratories as the tech is not proven to work as advertised. They are in the same situation as liquid metal batteries, cool ideas without the proof they will be successful in the market. HOWEVER, $MP is a way to play EV's & Renewable energy without the risk because $MP is not relying on scientific breakthroughs, it is a commodity producer. They don't care who wins the EV race, the battery tech or company that wins the battery race, or the wind energy companies that win contracts, all they care about is the mass adoption fo those technologies. It is a unique way to play these trends without having to bet on winners or losers in the field as you're betting solely on the industry. The company is positioned to benefit greatly regardless of who wins and lets be real, the market is incredibly saturated with companies that won't win. Look at all the different EV makers big and small, the different battery companies, etc. I have a tough believing that all the small EV makers will have a shot when the large auto companies get more involved. I believe the best way to see profit without that risk is through symmetrical bets with no breakthroughs needed, just the market to develop

DD below. 

Today's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: 


1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. 


2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. 


3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. 


4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). 


5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.

Despite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:

6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). 

7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.

8. On 31 December 2020, Lion Electric disclosed that Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Electric up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Electric, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Electric. Lion Electric has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.

9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Electric includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Electric will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.

Therefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).

NightMan_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much did the Tesla shorts lose in total? A nuanced explanation of how to calculate the total time periodic loss. Well, this is actually a very complicated derivative metric because you have to take the average short position combined with the timeliness of outpulling and the leveraged price of the increase in shares combined with their liquid equity at the time and the activation of their risk management strategy in terms of mitigating their loses at the right time against waiting for the price to fall beyond their short position.

Fortunately, I can translate all of that for you.

How much did the Tesla shorts lose in total?

Fucken *heaps* mate.

So let that be a lesson to you. Don't short the stonks unless you know it's not going to be a stonk anymore in which case maybe.

N.B. - Just for translation purposes 'fucken heaps' means a great deal. If there is any emphasis on the heaps, it means a great great deal of. As part of the Australian lexicon, this may be somewhat difficult to translate for outsiders._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MORE ARTICLES HYPING UP STEEL PRICES Obligatory disclaimer that I am not the godfather of steel. 

Steel was up today and I found this article published today - [https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/could-steel-prices-soon-hit-1000ton-in-the-new-year](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/could-steel-prices-soon-hit-1000ton-in-the-new-year) hyping it up EVEN more

&#x200B;

Quotes from steel buyers in the article - 

* “It’s going to be a record year on the upside and the downside.”
* “The domestic supply/demand imbalance coupled with the foreign supply/demand imbalance warrants these prices. Add higher raw material costs for electric arc and basic oxygen furnaces, and you have a perfect storm.”
* “This is 2004 and 2008 combined. Everyone is scrambling for steel, so they are doubling up on orders. Even OEMs have customers that are placing multiple orders because they are hedging their bets on who can get them the end product faster. Once that end product ships to them, they will cancel their order with the other OEM, and then this will ripple back through the steel supply chain. I truly see a possible 2008 price curve setting up. Remember, scrap and iron ore were also extremely elevated during 2008. Look at what the analysts are projecting for 2021. It all looks very familiar.”
* “The tightness in supply is what will hinder us in being successful. We can’t make a sale if we can’t get steel. It’s extremely ugly out there in the trenches.”
* “Once we get clear of the availability issues, which I expect will continue through February 2021, we will be in pretty good shape.”

**Why Intel is doomed**

Intel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch.

**Microsoft will kill Intel**

Apple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife. Short this stock if you like free money

First - let's check in on Iron Ore spot prices: 

* US Futures - [Link](https://www.investing.com/commodities/iron-ore-62-cfr-futures)
   * Look at Contracts - $164/ton for January and holding $150/ton through May
* Shipping Rates - [Link](https://twitter.com/HELLENICSHIP/status/1346134717607849997?s=20)
   * Hitting $167/ton at the port
* Yearly Outlook - [Link](https://twitter.com/AnaliseEnergia/status/1346053710397452289?s=20)
   * Here we can see that May and September have the most volume and OI - they will drive Q2 and Q3
   * Prices are holding over CNY1,000/ton through May and CNY950/ton through September. That's an incredible price for any miner. 

Second - let's check in on relevant news: 

* Shipping/Exports - [Link](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/)
   * Exports from Brazil/Australia are near ATH despite high prices
   * For context - $VALE shipped about 6m tons of iron for the last week of December. At $160/ton, that's nearly $1b in revenue for a week. VALE is expected to have about $11b in revenue for the quarter, which also takes into consideration all their other commodities (e.g. Nickel, which was up 5% today on spot). 
   * Shipping prices (Baltic Dry Index) are also near ATH despite heavy volume
* India - [Link](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020628/Indian-Steel-Association-writes-to-PM-defending-price-hike.html)
   * Not priced in, and shouldn't be, but local Indian companies are complaining about the price hikes that China is causing on a global scale. India is a huge exporter of iron, and are proposing a 6 month ban on iron exports to stabilize domestic prices. 
* China - [Link](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020661/China-resumes-imports-of-steel-scrap-meeting-new-standards.html)
   * Couple things going on here:

1. China recently allowed for importing scrap steel to help shore up the lacking supply
2. China steel plants are running at full capacity despite high input prices for both met coal and iron ore - surprisingly prices are being pushed to consumers instead of steel producers. The customer in this case is the Chinese government 
3. China relations with India and Australia are soured - China is beating out Indian companies for contracts by selling at ridiculously low prices and China/Australia have an ongoing price war

Things to look out for: 

1. Changes in the May/September futures for Iron Ore (input #1) 
2. Changes in Met Coal prices (input #2) 
3. Changes shipping prices (input #3) 

Right now I'm playing $VALE for Iron Ore and $TECK for Met Coal. I've posted about $TECK in other posts - know they have 11% ownership by the China Investment Corporation. If it isn't obvious - China is driving prices globally for steel, iron, coal, and dry bulk rates. 

Positions:

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over $5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices. 

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc). 

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons. 

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the "Quant Quake" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.

It's a new year and I thought I'd share some things I learned after reading "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" about the trading legend Jesse Livermore that made hundreds of millions trading both bull markets and the great 1929 crash.

If you haven't read it or heard about it, I strongly recommend checking it out. If you're like most of us and can't read, check it out on Audible or check out these tips for rough summary of some of the trading gems I got out of it!

&#x200B;

* Trade with the trend. Buy in a bull market, short in a bear market.
* It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. They say you never go broke taking profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.
* There is nothing new on Wall Street. What has happened in the past will happen again, and again, and again. This is because human nature does not change
* A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.
* Don't trade when there aren't clear opportunities.
* Trade along the path of least resistance. If after a long steady rise a stock turns and gradually begins to go down, with only occasional small rallies, it is obvious that the line of least resistance has changed from upward to downward.
* The speculator’s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope. 
* Wait for the market to confirm the opinion before entering. Patience leads to "the big money."
* Let profits run.
* Don't average down on a losing position. Close trades that show a loss (good trades generally show profit right away).
* Trade with a stop, and know it before you enter.
* Exit trades where the prospect of further profits is remote (the trend is over or waning).
* Trade the leading stocks in each sector; trade the strongest stocks in a bull market or the weakest stocks in a bear market.
* Don't follow too many stocks.
* If you can’t sleep at night because of your stock market position, then you have gone too far._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Option Purchases Over 100K 12/23 - 12-31 In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/asn0bkz3de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=3365d254c4a27fe89e48f04324a8f46666459e5f)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the "Targeted Flow" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow](https://preview.redd.it/040n3avbde961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b98cbe2929d39c27a068f58ed8a5f6a73feeb7)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY
