Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: To all new TSLA shareholders 1) Tesla is volatile. There will be 5%+/- days. "Back in the day" we say 10-20% swings. Get use to it.

2) Tesla doesn't always go up. Sorry. It had a 11 day green streak. 

3) Tesla stock doesn't care if you sell now. Someone else will buy your shares for cheaper.

4) Tesla is a long term hold. Nothing has changed about the company to justify the sell off but it is due for a correction. In 3-5 years, you'll be grateful you held strong. Before November 2019, this stock traded between $100-$300/share pre-split for YEARS. 

If you're still reading this and holding your shares, don't sweat about the down days. Load up more shares if you're invested in this company's future. IMO, on a volatile stock like this I add on every 10%+ drop because you never know how far down it could go._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Realty Income (O) share offering They dilute by 10.5 million shares for property acquisition.

I was reviewing the chart and it looked really good.

On the daily: Crossed 200 and 50 MA in an uptrend, MACD Crossover indicates a BUY. 

On the weekly: Crossed 200 Week MA for the 4 time in 2.5 years. The previous 3 times it went passed $2.00

MACD Crossover looks PERFECT with a BUY indicator. 

- I ran the SUPERTREND script on it and it put in a BUY indicator. 
- I ran the Moving Averages Crossover script and it put in a BUY indicator. 

Both scripts seem very accurate on this chart historically. 

RSI is still far from cooling off on the weekly. Tomorrow might be a cool off day on the daily RSI in what looks like a week long uptrend.

So at a moment I am learning and investing with paper money. What I do is basically pick a company which releases it's quarter earning report the next day. Then just research the company, how it is doing currently, a quarter/year before, what analysts estimates are for the upcoming report and so on. Then once quarter earning report is out compare it with estimates, read about future guidance, etc. and decide whether I should go in long or short on market open, but it seems I've failed at my very first actual attempt.

So Commercial Metal Company (CMC) first quarter earnings report was out today, I was researching the company, it's growth, year to year revenue, eps, basically investigating the report and deciding whether I should go in long or short on market open, I've estimated that the stock would go down, but it didn't, premarket stock dropped significantly, but on market open it rose back up and after that there was no substantial change throughout the day. Question is, why didn't stock drop? [future guidance](https://imgur.com/a/kQv4Ctq) is not good, revenue and eps compared to former quarter dropped as well, everything hinted that the stock would go down. Am I missing something?

Just want to understand what I am missing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think Motley Fool is a legitimate resource for stock picking People accuse MF of pump and dump schemes, claiming that if they really were successful investors they would be keeping their information to themselves.

1. If you're invested in a company for the long term, sharing your DD makes it MORE LIKELY for your company to succeed. You get more people to invest in the company you own, the company gets more money to improve their bottom line, (marketing, hiring more engineers, obtaining more money for R&D etc...). Which then encourages more people to invest in them.
2. MF has been operating for the past \~30 years. If they really were operating a pump and dump scheme, they would've been ousted long ago.
3. One of the MF founders interviewed Jack Bogle. During a segment they discussed that the more often you trade or sell stocks, the more likely you are to underperform the market. And they also found that if Warren Buffet never sold a single stock he would've been much wealthier today. Similarly MF found that if they never sold a single stock that they purchased, they also would've performed better. So they stopped adding when to sell stocks on their news letters.

That's why long term investors like ARK and Motley Fool SHARE all of their research and purchases. When they do that, more people invest in their companies, those companies then have a better chance of getting an early advantage compared to their competitors, and so on._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Motley Fool service recommendation Hey everyone, I currently have Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Rule Breaker subscriptions and like the services.

Bank of America cited Tesla's fundraising potential for their more bullish outlook. The company announced in December that it will sell up to $5 billion in stock to raise additional cash for factory expansions. The offering drives a growth cycle that allows Tesla to more efficiently build out production capacity while retaining healthy cash reserves, the bank said.

"It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price," the analysts said.

For the time being, the bank expects the bulls' winning streak to rage on. Tesla's ability to aggressively build new factories to meet strong demand will lift deliveries and improve its ability to raise cash through stock offerings. While production woes and cash shortages plagued the company just years ago, Tesla's soaring valuation alleviates those concerns and cements the automaker's position as the world's dominant electric-vehicle producer, Bank of America said._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NEE or LIT?

Trump's approach to trade and national economic management backfired in the US by dragging down US exports more than its trade partners, and so the US trade deficit has grown in the past few years while China's exports have grown. One thing that has driven dry bulk shipping in recent days/weeks is China's spiking need for transports, so China's trade has grown into the current carrying capacity of dry bulk shipping.

So here's the big picture: China's trade needs (both import and export) have grown into the current carrying capacity of global dry bulk shipping, and at the same time we are in both (1) a COVID-19 related consumption low in dry bulk shipping that will lift when lockdowns do, and (2) a multi-year, decade low in dry bulk shipping due to Trump's backfired trade war, that will most likely fade as Biden faces the need to restart the trade alliances and stimulate the US economy with more trade. At the time I started investing in these stocks, I was expecting them to multiply by a factor of 10x at least. Now, I expect something less than that going forward because of the big run up in shipping stocks, but I still see at least a doubling of these stocks in 2021 and lockdowns start to lift as well as naval stocks starting to draw investment again (naval stocks, unlike airline stocks, haven't seen pre-vaccine investor interest yet).

I wanted to get a dry bulk shipping post in because it's as sure of a thing as I know of in terms of rebound recovery stocks. I hope someone finds this helpful!

Edit: BDRY is up big again today, 14% in the morning

Edit 2: Because dry bulk shipping businesses have high margin and stable assets (ships), they aren't normally high growth stocks and some of them pay some of the highest dividends out there. So this is a generational opportunity for dividend portfolios, in case your dad's retirement portfolio could use some major growth._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When to buy back into nio Hey guys,

I own some stocks of companies that give dividends (such as AT&T and apple), but they make up only a very small percentage of my portfolio.

Now, I want to slowly increase my ETF holdings and dividend stocks in the coming years, and hopefully reach 30-40% in ETFs and also have a considerable number of stocks (ETFs) that have dividends, so at least for the first 4-5 years after retirements, I don't have to sell my stocks to finance my living.

What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings & PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).

We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary & Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small & mid-caps have outperformed.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba & MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.

In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla & TSM.

We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.

While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.

So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.

This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.

So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:

They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.

They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.

The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.

And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.

Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).

But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.

So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla & NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.

On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.

And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points

"As EV technologies advance and battery cost lowers, it is possible that we may enter the massive market, but definitely not with Nio brand," William Li, chief executive of Nio told reporters on Sunday. He gave no more detail.
Nio did not immediately respond to a request for further details. The company is currently delivering three sports utility vehicle (SUV) models built at its Hefei plant, which are mostly priced above 300,000 yuan ($46,200).
Nio, which also competes with Tesla Inc in China, on Saturday launched its first sedan model as it eyes a greater share of the world's largest car market.
Nio delivered 43,728 vehicles last year and has a market capitalisation of over $92 billion, surpassing conventional automakers Daimler and General Motors Co .

Thanks for comments!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There is no "new normality"  

Hello I was doing some research on how to get advantage of potential grow as we transition out to a "new" normality scenario but after a lot of hours and research I found there will be no new normality in a few years since now.

Why I'm saying this:

I always talk local, I wish everyone with more outside data can discuss on this but in Spain where I live they said everyone will get the vaccine and they placed a sketchy calendar on vaccination times and everything will be over in a year.

I never trust media, so I did my own research and I found from a family doctor they planned to get vaccinated around 70% of " risk group" people by August 2021 and even further there is no plan to vaccinate >30 age population **yet.**

What that said to me is there will be a long time before this gets out and we will have to live a couple of years with this new "lifestyle".

For now I invest into growing medical companies focusing on the virus like BioNTech, Moderna and CansinoBIO.

Thank you in advance for your patience._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bearish about current market - looking for strategies Hi,

I've been a bull for pretty much all my investment life. However, I can't stop the feeling that we're heading at full speed towards the next dot-com crash. Several reasons for this:

1. A lot of the CARES money went into the stock exchange. There is a statistic that investing into stocks increased by 90% compared to the pre-CARES period for that group of people. 
2. The only thing that can be took from #1 is that, when CARES stops and lockdowns lifted, wouldn't people start pulling that money out? The market normally produces a couple of percent gains per month, I'm seeing a lot of people here who expect 5-10% increases every day. And it makes sense, few people would spend energy in the stock exchange without it being life changing. And that can only happen if you're either investing with a very long term in mind or if you have a small portfolio and need big gains. 
3. Money will come out of the stock exchange and go into the economy, essentially confirming what a lot of people are afraid of: inflation. You can't add 50% to M1 (essentially currency in circulation) in just a year, decrease production because of Covid and not get inflation when everything comes back to normal. Inflation will then trigger all kinds of mechanisms, FED has confirmed that they don't plan to increase interest rates in the next couple of years, but they will need to do something about inflation and I think that will be the end of it.

Now, I know this topic is sensitive to a lot of people and might get downvoted. The best thing that can come out of this is that we debunk all my concerns above which should only strengthen the bulls' investment thesis. I'd very much like to be wrong about this.

For those that share my concerns, what strategies are you looking at?

I didn't do a crazy amount of research yet, just figured I'd throw it out to the smarter people here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Top 5 Growth Picks for 2021 #1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)

The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.

The top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.

#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn’t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.

#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)

Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker “CRM”). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.

However, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.

#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)

Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.

Array is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.

#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck & Co. (MRK).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.

**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Infrastructure Bill Stocks It is looking likely that the Biden administration and a democratic House and Senate will push for a new infrastructure bill early in the presidency. Today, Joe Manchin (Dem Senator from WV) was saying that he would favor an infrastructure bill versus stimulus checks...for what it's worth I think both will happen.

This bill would likely be a combination of traditional roads, construction stocks as well as renewable energy initiatives such as charging stations. What stocks do you think will benefit the most?

A few I have my eye on:

Equipment Manufacturers:

CAT, Komatsu, Volvo, John Deere

Distributors/Rental Companies: ALTG (Alta Group), Titan Machinery, United Rentals, NSCO

Charging/Fuel Cell: PLUG, SBE, BEEM, FCELL 

Building Materials: Not as knowledgeable in this area

What do you all have your eye on, or what have you already invested in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is $SRPT (Sarepta Therapeutics) a free money? ARKG added 845,575 shares on Friday For those who have no idea what $SRPT is/does (like me), basically they reported bad clinical trail result (statistically insignificant) for one of their studies. For people familiar with pharma industry it is relatively a normal incident.  However, the shares of $SRPT dropped 51.29% on that news. This is obviously a panic sell off. The price is expected to go up and I have no idea by how much. Additionally, our favorite ARKG bought  845,575 shares after the drop.

Why I shouldn't buy this stock? I mean is there any risk in buying this stock quick profit?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Rankings by Exponential Price Movements Compiled a list of stocks ranked by their 1-year exponential price movements:

* [https://marcuswan.com/nasdaq](http://marcuswan.com/nasdaq)
* [https://marcuswan.com/nyse](http://marcuswan.com/nyse)

Updated every weekend before the new trading week.

The goal is to discover trending stocks that may be under the radar.  Currently, I look at 2 indicators - the stocks's rank and strength.  The higher the rank of the stock indicates a stronger exponential price movement over the past year relative to other stocks.  The higher the strength of the stock indicates that the stock has consistently performed better than the other stocks over the past year.

E.g. A **high-rank** stock may be poor performing at the start, but has been outperforming in recent times.  A **high-strength** stock is a stock that has consistently maintained good performance over the past year.

A word of caution that a high ranking stock could indicate that the stock is gaining momentum or conversely indicate that it is over-bought and might pull back.

Possible methods to shortlist stocks for further due diligence:

* **High rank** \+ **high strength** may indicate a strong stock with exponential growth (or over-bought)
* **High rank** \+ **low strength** may indicate a weak stock with exponential growth (or over-bought)
* **Low rank** \+ **high strength** may indicate a strong stock without exponential growth (or lagging)

Would your shares be distributed among the new entities.formed? Would they only stay with the former or core company? Do they just have you cash out?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UBI Inevitable? I think everyone agrees that wealth has been sucked up from smaller/medium businesses and transferred to big retailers. Thats already a tragedy, because big boys dont like paying taxes unlike small and medium sized businesses.

Second wealth transfer is happening in the stock market. Thanks to my boys at wallstreet and robin, average Joe is literally gambling away either penny stocks or options. Great news is that robin sells that order flow to Citadel to take other side of the trade. Its amazing because RH customers probably have larger loss rate than forex. So basically around 85-95%. I would love to have order flow to take every damn opposite trade of those.

So there you go, money is completely sucked out from the bottom up, to already rich top.

I think there is a chance we’re so far gone that without UBI we’re literally going to crumble. Once all Covid supports expire and are removed. So inflation it is most likely.

Whats hilarious is that UBI will allow the corps balloon even further. Soon Amazon/Tesla will run whole states.

The reality is that we need a huge correction to get back to real world in economic sense. It should be around 1929 level of pain. No administration has balls for that. They will keep the printer going, handing out money so people can keep on buying and making SPY go up. It will keep going until one day it does not... In a distant future.

Many will think this is a great idea, exactly why UBI will pass through. Long term, a world where you rely on GOV and mega corps... Yeah...

I think many people fail to realize, UBI is a trojan horse for the average person. Nothing good will come from it in long term. Its another tool to feed megacorps to complete monopoly.

If you need proof, just look where the stimulus check money went.

Average Joe needs to realize, he loses when then GOV and Corporations are powerful and monopolistic - Exactly what UBI will ensure happens.

So get ready, Trojan horse is coming and we’re welcoming it with open arms. Don’t be confused in decades when you live in Orwellian nightmare. This is when it began._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Getting started in stocks I just put in $20 of Tesla stock and $25 into an EFT/ ivv/ index fund.

It's probably been talked about before but it's new information that it's going to be a lot larger than expected. 

Please critique my thoughts and add your own opinions.

Clean energy - everyone talks about ICLN but that's global and also underperforming QCLN which is US. My pick is QCLN. 

Marijuana - not sure if Biden will legalize or just decriminalize it, so a little risky. Also not sure if it will be usurped by big argi players. In my research, MSOS is considered the best ETF if you want exposure.

Infrastructure - IFRA. But unknown whether spending bills will pass. Obama promised a lot of infrastructure spending, but he didn't get it done. Could be the same story.

EV - Unknown honestly. TSLA is way too high to recommend at current prices. GM has EVs in the pipeline, but I'm not bullish on them long term. Anyone have any thoughts on any safe plays relating to EVs?

$2000 stimulus checks - boost in consumer spending? Or will they dump it in the stock market? In banks? Just save it because the economy isn't doing that great and things could easily get worse before they get better.

Housing - he plans to build a lot of affordable housing. Thoughts on best stocks / ETFs that would benefit? XHB seems most respectable and broad/safe, but no clue if here will be a lot of upside. The market does not seem to think so YTD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will stimulus affect JKS, SEDG or MAXN? So the general idea has been that solar stocks will go up because of Biden and the Democrats controlling Congress.

How will this, but more specifically the idea of more US stimulus to stimulate the US economy affect these stocks that are owned by *outside* of the USA companies?

JKS is headquartered in China

SEDG is headquartered in Israel

MAXN focuses on outside of USA sales (but is somehow related to SPWR which is based in the USA)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICLN or QCLN I feel that Clean Energy tech will be pretty big over the next few years.

I would like to have some advice on what do with my ITM Covered Calls. Last year, at the height of the pandemic, I sold some AAPL covered calls expires 01/15/21 for a good premium. Of course, I did not anticipate the >80% run AAPL had last year after the stock split. My CCs are deep in the money now.

I believe AAPL might have more to run in the near term with blockbuster iPhone 12 sales etc., But I don't think it can sustain $2T+ valuation when the interest rates eventually go up.

I see 3 options:

1. Sell 50% my AAPL position and buy back the CCs taking the loss. This means I get to keep the upside of my remaining 50% AAPL shares.
2. Let the shares be called, keep the premium and reinvest the money in some ETFs.
3. Roll out the option further. This means I hold the bags but wait for a dip opportunity to buy back the calls at much cheaper price, while I keep collecting dividends.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trading in Roth. Long term growth vs short term gains Hey all. I'm about a month into my trading career and have a question and I hope I word it correctly. I'm 45 and my wife and I have about 20 years before we look to retire. We both just opened a Roth IRA and will get $12,000 in each before April. My question is should we do our long term trading (etfs and such) in these accounts and trade short term in our joint fidelity account? I know the money we take our in 20 years will be tax free but I feel we'll pay allot of capital gain taxes in the joint account.

My thought is we keep the etfs in the joint as we will be adding about 20 grand to it throughout the year. We could put allot more into the long term growth. Then we trade short term in each roth account and taxes don't matter on the gains we'll hopefully make. What are your thoughts on this? Thank you all for the help._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 20K I have 20k to invest in something tomorrow. I’m looking to drop it all on one company. My initial thought was to put it into an emerging “clean energy” company and hopefully ride Bidens’ Blue Wave. My second thought was to drop it all into TSLA shares. Every time I doubted Elon, I was wrong. So I think it has room to grow. 

Either way, I’ll have a 7%-10% trailing stop loss in place. 

What would you drop 20k into?

Thanks Mates_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ More Fishy Than Martha Stewart I clearly remember the March day last Spring when Bill Ackman got on Bloomberg and told reporters his company got back into stocks as heavily as possible, more or less saying the bloodshed was now an opportunity.  At this point, new unemployment claims were shooting up.  Weekly ongoing unemployment payments will still skyrocketing because no recipient wanted to end it.  The extra $600 weekly bonus for the unemployed meant that everyone barely lifted a finger to seek out work.  Most businesses were closing and the few that stayed open could not get back anyone they furloughed.  The bonus meant the economy could not consider being normal until July.  The White House even talked about extending covid assistance beyond June.  Also there was no vaccine, and potentially no effective treatment might ever come about.  The market did not have a reason to bottom out because it finally reached a "fair value".  The p/e was still absurdly high in the Spring so it had nothing to do with value.  The S&P dividend yield was "better" but still dismal.  It takes super human ability to know the year and month of the bottom.  How would you know the bottom point plus or minus 24 hours, and do it when blood was still pouring out of the economy's eyes, ears and mouth?  How would you be so confident that you would make it a point to announce to the world that you put all your chips on that roulette number at that moment with the ball still rolling?

I looked for an article that chronicled this unbelievable feat, and found one.  Not only did he guess the day, but he owned just enough bearish investments to be profitable on the way down to the market's bottom.  This was not mentioned in his interview.
