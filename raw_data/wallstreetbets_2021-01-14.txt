 AUP / AUPH - Tendies to the MOON !!!! 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 I won't pretend I wrote this as I'm too lazy and illiterate to, but have definitely been reading everything I can find and this DD comment summed things up better then I ever could.

 🚀🚀 FDA Approval has until 1/22  💎✋ 

"Conditions given by FDA for voclosporin's APPROVAL was “ If 23.7 mg taken twice daily significantly improves complete renal response rates and there’s no significant side effects”. Voclosporin met both of those conditions in phase 3 trial and that’s essentially the reason Aurinia submitted NDA. Data from a total of 534 patients from AURA-LV and AURORA was integrated and presented, demonstrating that 268 patients with LN treated with voclosporin in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose steroids achieved statistically superior and faster Renal Response rates compared to 266 patients treated with MMF and steroids alone. The effects were also observed in Hispanic patients, a high-risk lupus nephritis population. Treatment with voclosporin resulted in clinically meaningful and a statistically significant higher Renal Response rate of 43.7% compared to 23.3% in the control arm at one year. The Company also presented PK data analyzed from the AURA-LV and AURORA studies further supporting the potential to eliminate the need for therapeutic drug monitoring.The AURA-LV and AURORA studies were of similar design and conducted in comparable patient populations. The data from both studies for subjects treated with the recommended voclosporin dose of 23.7 mg twice daily (AURORA n=179, AURA-LV n=89) or with matching placebo (AURORA n= 178, AURA-LV n=88) were therefore pooled for an integrated analysis. The data presented at ASN Kidney Week 2020 was submitted as part of voclosporin’s new drug application (NDA) to FDA as well. Based on potential patient population sales of voclosporin have been estimated from more than $1 billion to $2.2 billion. My prediction- Voclosporin will be approve and conservative price target between $35-50 upon approval. Good luck to all. "

Hello everyone! Again, thanks to u/extraegg and his solid DD before battery day back in September. Like everyone else, I got rid of all of my VALE positions in disgust after battery day. However, the DD just made so much sense that I found myself returning back to it over and over. I eventually bought right the fuck back in.

200 shares bought at different times for a cost basis of $15.67. I had $12, $13, and $16 strike prices earlier in the year, but sold those to use the gains to take positions in MT, TECK, and a rather large position in GME (these last 2 days have been amazing).

Hope this gives people inspiration. VALE seems like too good of an opportunity to pass up this year, and probably for the next few years too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To the Moon we go - trying to make my salary by next week _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did you guys partake in the free tendies I alerted last week? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why you should go for ELY Hear me out, Callaway is set to boom after announcing the merger with Topgolf. 

When they announced it, Callaway dropped 25% to around $15 or so. At the moment they’re at 27+ (highest it’s been since like 1997) 

The golf business is booming with the pandemic. People who can’t throw a baseball 3 yards and picking up golf because it’s safe and “athletic” 

Callaway just signed on one of the best golfers in the game. 

The real sweet deal is Topgolf. Topgolf comes with the venues, both domestic and international (just opened Dubai). Toptracer technology which is 200% yoy, that’s the red line you see when a golfer hits a ball and it tracks it for you for the people that don’t know golf. They’re also in a ton of casinos, hotels and existing driving ranges with that technology. Additionally topgolf grows about 30% a year and average venue will do $17 million a year in revenue, 4-5m in profit. 

Here’s where it gets even sweeter. Topgolf’s current ceo until the merger is Dolf Burle. He came from Dave n Busters, where he implemented a lot of things before he took them public. Dave n Busters half off Wednesday = Topgolf half off Tuesday. We all know how successful DnB was without anything addition other than their venues. Opened at 17 and maxed at 70 or so. The pandemic hasn’t slowed anything down at these Topgolf venues. They should be finalizing the deal in the next couple of months. Do you DD, but I’m standing by this

Positions for me 312 shares @ 18.77, I would’ve bought more but I had limited funds.

First, the boomers have become 40 year olds.

Takes -

- Semiconductors won't outperform the market

- Caterpillar which just hit its ATH is a good buy before Biden's address (he wasn't sure if it had or not and I didn't care enough to check)

- It will 'be different' from the last 12 months and a movement out of tech

- They gave a majority of the time for their 'new' economy to airlines and their revenues compared to what they were. Meanwhile Bill Gates is buying out the world's largest private jet company with plans for disruption, he might not even have  a plan ready. He just knows the lazy people that have been running these companies have left a giant amount of innovation on the table.

They have reframed the market just for tonight as one of needing recovery.

Hint, look at the charts, it has recovered, just because there's laggards, doesn't mean the market hasn't recovered.

The stimulus instead of being an awesome boost and jumpstart of American ingenuity, industry and new infrastructure, is now required to 'prop' up the economy.

It's a gaslight of the economy that only serves to undersell the stimulus.

They think infrastructure means roads when it can mean automated driving systems, they think it means solar panels when it means a circuit breaker SaaS that handles the loading of the power grid while allowing individual consumers to profit and invest in their own solutions.

They don't know what they are talking about.

Don't put your money in grandfathered business.

The crazy rise in REITs today is the biggest signal ever that they have no idea. Their response to this stimulus plan was to run back to their childhood home and jump under the covers.

Innovation will always win out and the old guard just aren't capable and don't have the imagination

We pick winners here because we know progress of the human race when we see it.

Evidence to suggest Apple just had a good quarter

\-The iphone 12 (released oct 2020)  had 2 million pre-orders within 24 hours which is massive in comparison to the 800,000 preorders of the iphone 11

\-28.9 billion in sales from macs in 2020 compared to 21.2 billion in 2019 (roughly  25% revenue growth in the sector)

\-iphone 12 sales have outperformed the iphone 11 by 21%

As far as I can tell as long as you don’t buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up. Although there is evidence to suggest Apple just had an outstanding quarter lets assume that they only see a share value increase of about 5% (a little below average) by Feb 5. With a 2/19 $130.00 c position you would still net about 25% in gains. With AAPL shares being down recently there’s more room for growth.

Think about how cute you look, browsing reddit for the latest method of losing money, but think also about how there's CABLE EVERYWHERE IN THE GROUND...Lumen Technologies..they have a FUCKTON of it!

NO LUMN = NO INTERNET = NO WSB !

So, Lumen has like a bunch of cable right, it's laid down and it's there, it works and you don't pay for it but once, then it's 100% profit, it's one of the rare things that legally works for free...

Lumen is a boring merger that's basically CenturyLink but that's trivial, there's only so many companies that own HARDCORE CABLES LITERALLY ALL AROUND THE WORLD (1), and which way do you think internet demand will go in the future? If you think down, then I have bad news, you're a 🌈🐻 

If you think up, then congrats, you still have some grey matter left to realize that the global population will not plateu until about 11B, yes 11 BILLION(2), that's not money that's people you fucking idiot and only half the people in the world are connected to the internet right now!!!(3)

Don't be swayed by the people that trash this stock, they are braindead if they don't see that internet is now an essential commodity just like water, and cables for Lumen Tech are like waterpipes for water, don't you enjoy having both the internet and water delivered to you? DON'T even try to pretend that you would last longer without internet than water! (4) 

The internet isn't old(5), it's not an outridden horse, it's just as old as the MILF in the porn you'll be watching later this night to jerk off to, because your wife's boyfriend shut the door on your boner on his way to rob you of the sweet pussywalls. Hell chances are its Lumen Technologies that's providing you with that porn. 

This stock at 10$ is about 50% below intrinsic value, if you even know what that is of course... Not long before the banks realize that the internet is now in the essential commodity section, (their boomer and 🌈🐻 brains still live in the days when people jerked off to PLAYBOY magazines) and the providers of such commodity are also essential! Especially those that have REAL FUCKING FIBRE IN THE GROUND THROUGH THE CONTINENTS, $LUMN just happens to be one that's undervalued AF.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Bulls want to keep the price under 40 for those that sold CC exp this Friday cause they know the squeeze will happen within the next week or so. As long as GME doesn’t do an offering to scare paperhands we should be good to go after Melvin puts expire worthless tomorrow (but a 1million offering will basically do nothing anyway except fuck with sentiment) Do not buy weeklies even now, though. Buy at least a month out and preferably April calls cause you never know what will happen in the market. 

Overall, I’m confident the squeeze will happen within the next month or so if not tomorrow/next week because melvin fucked up buying 54k puts expiring tomorrow. April calls will buffer you in case it doesn’t cause this shit will squeeze like nothing we’ve ever seen before.

 If you’re not in GME then you don’t like free money.

[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]

**POSITIVES**

- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. 

- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). 

- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. 

- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). 

**RISK FACTORS**

- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: ["...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market."](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)

- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).
[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)

- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.

 - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. 

 - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories).
 - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.

AMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to 🚀🚀 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.

My conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.

Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of "only" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its "no time soon" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into "value" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is "in control" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I’m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let’s dive in.

**Can we 10X from here?**

For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.

The framework includes:

Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership

Risk Considerations

Price Considerations

Explosive Business Growth

**1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**

For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?

In the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.

After that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6’4”, 245lb offensive lineman.

Mark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he’s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said “We have 74,000 customers that don’t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.” How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I’ll share with you a little more history behind the company.

After Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn’t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.

The focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000’s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying “I believe it’s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,”. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right – they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong – their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.

Only a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today – clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it’s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.

Going back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to “not get too enamored with your product”. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they’re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don’t buy a stock based on what you’ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. “If you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business” he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.

One of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It’s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.

Further evidence to support Mark and the rest of management’s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That’s very impressive as well.

Based on how customers are responding to the product, I think it’s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that “Desire and Purpose” are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the “Productivity Paradox” that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that’s what we want.

Another way to see if the leader of the company has “Desire and Purpose” is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they’re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people’s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company’s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he’s communicating the company’s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.

There’s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded “Best Company Culture” and “Best Companies for Women” by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It’s one thing to be awarded for “Best Company Culture” but to also be a “Best Companies for Women” when you’re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people’s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.

Source – Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.

I think we’ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It’s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they’ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we’ve established is present, there’s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.

Currently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I’d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he’s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that’s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.

This concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive. Hope you enjoyed and be sure to subscribe so you can stay tuned for Part 3, our next pick, and news &amp; updates about existing picks.

Although once public im sure starlink will be a real winner it is important to realize that its a large market and there are also many limiting factors to spacex/ starlink without getting into to it i would like to introduce and interesting opportunity

Lorl- loral space and communication .on nasdaq currently trading at 26$ and some change

The meat and potatoes: 

Loral currently owns 64% of  satellite producer telesat the remainder is owned by canadas public pension. It is the fourth largest in the world and has been around for 50 years. It has been excellently run by dan goldberg maintaining strong cashflows and important contracts. 
Telesat is currently in the process to create/ have in orbit a leo conetellation for 2022 which is said to cover the globe. the tech has been proven some of the best. 

Telesat will be selling some of its u.s spectrum in december in the public auction and will receive 375$ mil usd which is 1/3 or lorals current market cap. It is also in the process to possibly sell spectum in canada at auction but so far no word on that yet. Its annual revenue has been fairly consistent in the $800-1 bil mark which alone makes loral a value play with a market cap just over 600 mil.

My thesis: 

telesat will be going a different route offering backflow internet to customers with leo( going through existing isp)now some people have voiced criticism at this when comparing to spaceexs direct to consumer. The reality of our world is that many nations will not allow direct to consumer due to censorship as well as the heavily engrained relationships between current providers and government. Which will make backflow the way to go. Telesat is also working with lockheed martin and the pentagon.

Telesat just announced a partnership with nelco india which is huge as india has the second largest internet market in the world and nelco has stong government ties. Telesat also just announced further contract with darpa which could prove to be huge in the coming years. Telesat also has a large existing revenue base from its ongoing operations.

Expansion into India

https://www.aviationtoday.com/2020/10/05/nelco-use-telesat-leo-provide-satellite-connectivity-india/
Lorl and telesat will be merging this year as one and will trade on the nasdaq.

Telesat has the lobbying/ history and tech expertise to be a leader in the space race. Their partnerships in india north america and throughout the world will create a strong customer demand for their constellation. I believe we are on the cusp of some big announcements which will drive share price not to mention the value play already discussed.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tldr: lorl owns most of telesat and will be merging this year to trade on nasdaq. Telesat is one of the biggest satellite operators in the world and will have the most advanced leo system ever. And not that it matters but they generate almost 1bil of revenue a year at high margins._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB Basic Training _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TD Ameritrade got y’all name in they mouth. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB Declares Independence **IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 2021**

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one group of traders to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of Mad Money and other boomers requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all autists are created *superior*, that they are endowed by Ryan Cohen and u/deepfuckingvalue with certain unalienable rights, that among these are gamma squeezes, yolos, and the pursuit of Tendies. That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. 

The history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. 

* Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage 
* They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord 
* They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli
* They have declared our sacred meme stocks "casinos" 
* They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail
* They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments
* They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants
* They have imposed taxes on us without our consent

In every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. 

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer "brethren." We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their "smart" and "learned" government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE *SCREECHING REEEEES* OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. 

Wall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. 

We, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads. And that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT REETARDS, we have the power to set our own price targets, have the power to levy war on Melvin Capital, establish tendies, and to do all other things the autistic do. 

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of this sub, we mutually pledge OUR LIVES, OUR DD, AND OUR SACRED TENDIES._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Little gain weed porn Tilray still holding _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Look Ma we made it to WSJ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey retards, we made the news again. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME very likely to go to 47 or more tomorrow. 480 000 000$ worth of calls likely to be exercised.

Until today, there were no options available higher than 40calls. If you look at this image you will see an astounding amount of calls were purchased on the first day that these options were made available. In total they represent 480 million dollars worth of calls. This could easily trigger a squeeze to 47. With some luck, we can hit the 55 calls of which there are an astounding number. If this happens, the sky is the limit. 480M$ represents nearly 20% of the total GameStop market cap. As a final note, most shorts have NOT yet been margin called, we can do this Game gang.

UNQL (INNO prior) has already operated 47 charter cargo aircrafts between September 1 and November 30, 2020 and has just announced that it has contracted a further 33 charter flights to operate between December 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The total contract value committed so far is in excess of $ 20 million. 

Personal basic analysis: 
With an Excess of $ 20 million revenue for just one 3 month contract of 33 flights. Based on math of 20million minimum divided by 33 flights = $600,000 revenue per flight x the 47 flights already operated sept-nov = $28.2 Million revenue + the $20 million = $48.2 M revenue for just September 2020-March 2021 = $6.8M/month minimum in contract revenue.

With 69.6 Million shares outstanding and revenue turn over of 150~+ Million, that puts a price analysis at $2.15/share vs .15/share now 

While this is a possibility, it is a far out number to reach which is why the filing of financial documents is so important and the reasoning for UNQL current share price.

Financial documents are expected to be filed soon.

-BFB_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell when your position is uppies not downies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Got greedy last month with FOMO on Palantir. Decided to play long game on GME after I got burned. My portfolio's now well in the green. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could GME shorts be hedged up with calls? Think about it: everyone always asks "why didn't the shorts cover at $3?" From the outside it looks like pure greed but as another one of the endless GME posts pointed out, these institutions aren't fucking stupid. They don't just 💎👐 their profits and watch them go to 0 like we do. And if they actually were getting fucked, they would have covered a while ago.

My theory is that when GME went to its lows, the shorts essentially saw this as a gift from the gods. They were expecting GME to go to 0 in the next 5 years, not in 1. So they most likely saw that there was immense upside and instead of simply covering, they leveraged themselves to the tits with calls just like u/deepfuckingvalue, essentially creating a hedge for their short position. They knew GME would have a rebound in this covid economy and they basically shilled it on retail to make fat stacks. Once their calls print, they will own millions of shares which they can use to cover. After seeing Cohen's plan for the company they might even short it the fuck down again.

🚀🚀 next gen gaming console demand + stimulus checks = 🚀🚀 TV demand

&nbsp;

As I'm sure you basement-dwelling autists are already aware, the next gen consoles output 4k @ 120hz, which can only be achieved via HDMI 2.1. The problem (opportunity) thus far has been there are only a handful of displays available that have HDMI 2.1 ports to take advantage of the new consoles' capabilities. 

&nbsp;

Of those displays available, there was and still is one clear best option available: the LG CX OLED TV:

https://www.cnet.com/news/best-tv-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-series-s/

&nbsp;

You don't need a friend who totally doesn't work at Best Buy to tell you that they haven't been able to keep the LG CX in stock since November and that it's the best selling TV they've had in the 4 years they've been working there. Any retard can see that for themselves. 

&nbsp;

Q4 earnings will announced at the end of next week. Look for expectations to be CRUSHED. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&nbsp;

Bonus: LG already dominate the OLED display market - in both TVs and mobile (iPhone) devices. But they aren't stopping there. They are bringing their OLED tech to PC Monitors, and also making plays into the micro-LED space. The future is bright.

Shitty DD inside VIAC is on a fucking tear. Up from a $12 COVID low, VIAC is poised to become the next shinning star of WSB. Two big catalysts:

1. Acquisition is imminent. VIAC and it’s networks is the perfect target in the race for streaming dominance. They have more hours content than Netflix, Apple and Amazon combined. The Redstone family has waived off takeover discussions while the stock traded at all time lows, but now that we are at reasonable levels, it only makes sense for the talks to become more serious. I think we see an acquisition from a FANG stock in 2021. 

2. News Networks Advertising- how many times have you turned on the news this month? Viewership is at an all time high and advertisers are spending their money where people’s eyes are the most. We will see a beat on earnings and increase in forecast during the next Earnings call. 

Larger company at $25 billion, but options are cheap and this stock has a long way to run. I’m in at $30 and waiting for tomorrow’s pull back for some fat options contracts. I’m riding this short bus to $75 a share.

3/19 $35 c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME owners this week be like... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Holding until I die. Where’s Zac Efron? We're soarin', flyin' 🦅 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Analysis of Massive Potential GME Forced Selling Friday (Up to 1/3 of total float) There was some action in another thread about this, but thought I'd summarize my math on possible dealer/MM forced selling friday. **At present, it appears that  as many as 15.3m shares of GME will get dumped between now and the close Friday, and GME has float of 46m shares. This is essentially the reverse of yesterday, when I believe banks/dealers/mms essentially bought a good fraction of that, or maybe even a bit more using longer option exposures, on the way up, causing the huge melt up we saw.**

**I'm not saying GME is a bad or good stock, and I'm not saying Cohen's plan is good or bad. I'm not saying there isn't a future further short squeeze. I'm just saying that a massive block of selling may occur Friday on dealer hedging behaviors. And I am saying congratulations to all the longs who made a ton of money here (I certainly did earlier).**

I went through and counted all of the open interest of all options expiring on GME Friday - calls and puts - and then multiplied that by deltas when GME stock at $40. It's changed a bit since then. I used yahoo finance data, which may be slightly stale and cause some inaccuracy here.

Assumption: 90% of all calls and puts have a dealer on the short side hedging. If there are more named thetagang sellers, the implications are lesser, but I find it unlikely these aren't mostly dealer options.

Findings:

Assuming the 90% hedging, total shares to hedge options expiring on Friday is as follows: calls is around 15.85m shares. Total shares SHORT to hedge puts is around 525 thousand.  This means total shares or equivalents being held long by dealers/banks/mms to hedge right now JUST FOR FRIDAY (does not include longer dated options) is long 15.3m shares.

When Friday is ending, a few things happen:

1. If options are held to close, they get GME stock settled. Those won't affect price, assuming those who get the GME stock hold. But most people would not do that as option traders.
2. If you dump your massive tendie bearing options, you dump them to a dealer who in turn uses that call to neutralize their exposure, so they sell the delta exposure of your stock. If you sell a $20 call right now, a dealer is going to immediately dump 99.5 shares of GME stock.
3. OF course, if you do #2, then promptly buy new GME options, you offset some of this, but you won't offset most of it. A massively in the money call has a delta of 1, while a decently OOM call has a delta in the .1 to .3 range, which means net selling of 70 per contract , unless you buy a LOT more contracts, and options are getting more expensive. Of course, while a lot of us will roll to other GME calls, I'm sure some of you will take money out for taxes, or go buy other options on other things, or even take the put side of this trade.
4. And here's the kicker. Brokerages start forcing liquidations on these options as the close on friday approaches. If you would be out of margin compliance on the exercise of your massively appreciated options (by having a ton of GME stock and a huge negative cash balance after exercise), they'll simply force you to sell your options at the bid the MMs are offering. That then starts the cascade I just outlined in #2. You can then roll that into 3 if you want.

Be really careful here. This could entirely moon even higher next week. And there's a ton of longer dated OI I did not analyze. But Friday (if there's a lot of call monetization and thus share selling) and early through mid-day Tuesday (for those who accept stock settlement then dump it Tuesday) looks really scary in terms of dealer de-hedging, and the massive run we had these past few days looks like a gamma squeeze where these banks/dealers/mms had to accumulate shares to hedge all of their short options. Remember, there’s a huge gamma ramp in the 20s and low 30s that shot this up yesterday. That same ramp can shoot this stock down too.

**This is one of the largest dealer unwinds we've seen in any stock, and really anything could happen. More importantly, there's not currently a lot of gamma ramp above this, in part because it was hard to buy options at higher strikes until basically today. The fact the stock is levitating up today is in part because there’s no share supply due to how much dealers are holding to hedge options. It is also because near the money options are gradually converging on delta of 0 or 1, and most are in the money, so they are converging on delta one, and thus the net effect is slight to moderate buying today and early tomorrow, until people start selling those calls to not auto-exercise.**

edit after close thursday: looks like delta convergence of ITM options to 1 did drive a little bit of the same effect as yesterday, which means that dealer inventory probably increased slightly from when I wrote this.

edit 2 after close: I think you could see morning meltup as those options continue to hit 1 delta from .9 or whatever. I do think the selling should pick up by half way through. One commenter pointed out the surge in oct had similar mechanics on the option expiration, which started around noon NY time. I will likely exit much of my position if I don't see selling tomorrow, and exit the rest if I don't see it early tuesday. If this thesis plays out, I'd flip long at some point, but probably not until near end of day tomorrow.

Edit 3 - 1 1/4 hour after open Friday - looking like what I said though the market being on fire is pushing. I suspect a lot of the initial selling was dealers de hedging those 45, 50 and 55 calls they sold yesterday when open was weak and now we are sliding into puts that need hedging. May accelerate as people monetize calls, though people will be selling day calls too - but those are much smaller positions than the old calls. I am honestly surprised to see it down this much already.

Edit 4 - 2 hours to close. Has been flat around -10% for a while. Big selloff most likely to occur from here to close. If it doesn't, it means the buying force at play here + rolling of options offset enough of this. I won't be holding my puts into next week, and am red at this price level from buying too early yesterday. I'll be green at -15% though.

Edit 5 - 1.5 hours to close, I don't like how this is moving, so I exited my positions. Took a 15.5k loss. I may re-try next week if Tuesday is adequately green.  Shares avail to short went up a bunch (1m from one site, so its more than that) so it looks like some short covering was supporting today and absorbing this. There's also a lot of NTM call volume for next week, so presumably some of these ITM calls being dumped are being rolled. We may still see surprises in final 30 mins, but I'm less hopeful now. It seems like the dealer rebalance happened to a degree, but the lower volume than expected suggests the call rolling stopped a lot of it.

Edit 6 - 10 min to close- According to twitter (not 100% sure if true), IBKR Schwaab and others are removing or greatly tightening margin allowance on GME stock, which is going to cause some forced selling when they do. I estabslihed a new in the money put position into next week, despite taking a bath today. The fact they are doing it means they are very nervous about their risk management of those positions in their brokerages, which implies it's held by a lot of retail accounts on margin. That's a different thesis than this, but that makes me more OK with holding risk over the weekend since that's forced selling to an extent tuesday, that should crush some of the calls that are hedged into next week.

Edit 7 - At the close. Didn't play out in the end as violently as I thought, though below my 'bull' case of $37 ($35.50), but above my expected value of like $32. Stock out-performed what I thought it would with -11% down.  Short borrow fees went down, shares avail went up today, so at least a million shares of short covering happened today, maybe 2 or 3 million. Option volume was high, it appears a lot of calls were rolled into near the money options for next week, which would tend to reduce the amount of selling dealers need to do on exits this week. We thus have a big gamma ramp going into next week, so the stock will be volatile again. Eventually, there won't be enough new money to move the stock up, and since people are usually mostly OTM calls, as time approaches, those get de-hedged if the stock isn't reaching them, which can be selling if the momentum doesn't continue. I ended up taking a smaller at the money put position into next week after losing 15.5k on my original position and 5k in bad day trades. Logic on next weeks trade is that it's a lot of OTM calls and a gamma ramp, and the brokers increasing margin rules will cause some forced selling of stock on Tuesday since apparently a lot of retail traders are over-extended (otherwise there wouldn't be that margin rule). I'll likely dump these if I don't see that tanking the price fast on Tuesday.

Disclaimer: I did buy deep oom puts targeting NEXT week, and would make a ton of money if this came to pass. I put in about $100k in capital mostly in Jan 22 $28 puts.  This week makes more sense, but I'd get liquidated too by my broker if GME pukes Friday, so the trade won't work. I may very well swing hard long if the sell off is furious enough then ride this up again to $40 🚀 🚀 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best decision ever still results in worst trade of my life. Long story short I've been trading GME both-ways for a while with lots of success. Shorting the initial morning pop and covering later in the day. Also gone long for for periods of time when I felt a pop was coming. I believed in the short squeeze and the play but got caught holding a massive bag after Cohen announced he was joining. I definitely didn't realize how powerful the retard strength of this sub is.

Ending up covering roughly \~600kish in shares yesterday morning. Lost roughly \~300kish. Crazy to think if I somehow slept in or went on a morning run that I would have blown up my entire account and actually owed my broker money. I've gotten burned on crowded trades before and definitely learned another valuable lesson with this ordeal. Trying not to think about how much I lost and how much I could've made if I would've been long.

Congrats to the guys who killed it. I'm legit happy for you. On to the next play!

So I’m scrolling through fb at 5am bored, waiting for the market to open. The Robinhood group is talking about fubo tv. I’m half awake and look at the chart and notice it hit ATH at $60 Tuesday. I’m expecting a mini rally before it goes to shit. Based on the analyze tool, the trade was a guaranteed winner as long as the stock didn’t close below $20 a share at exp (td has never forced me out a trade), it was at $40, and ipoed around $15ish but traded around $25ish.

One of my accounts with TD had Apple call spreads worth $50 for earnings and $0.70 buying power yet the system allowed the trade to go in premarket yesterday. I’m confused as hell why this is going in but assume it will autocorrect at 8-9am. I forget about it.

9:30am, I sell my nflx 500/505c exp fri for $150, too early 🤦🏾‍♂️ it shoots up to $400 15 minutes later
I sell my amzn 3080/3085c for $320 too early

I notice fubo executes and shit is it volatile. I have no idea what to do. The mid point was $19.50 premarket, I put in $17ish thinking no way it executes. It drops to $14.50, comes back positive for a few seconds before staying around 14-15 mark. TD for the first time ever forces me out the position. I have to eat a $335 loss. Thank god I didn’t add leverage. TD rep has no idea why the system allowed the order to go through. 

Fast forward now, the system is still accepting covered call orders for Fubo with no cash required upfront! It’s letting me buy multiple contracts despite my account not being able to afford it. It’s allowing me to place an order to short 100 calls and buy the stock which would cost about $300k. 

This only seems to work for fubo stock. I tried Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Airbnb, and even cheaper prices and it didn’t work.

When I first invested in Palantir it was under this public opinion that they're creating groundbreaking, innovative tech in the AI field. Pretty far from the truth.

Unfortunately, there's nothing ground breaking or new about PLTR Gotham tech. It's a data aggregator. There's a few other companies I'm aware of off the top of my head that do the same thing and have been around for over a decade. IBM datastage, Alteryx, and Tableu are the big ones that most people have heard of. It's just a platform that allows non technical people to do technical things with their data through the use of GUIs and form input.

Sorry to burst every ones bubble but the only thing that PLTR has going for it is government contracts. They are not first to market in the private sector at all. They've been beat by the greater part of a decade. Please let me know if there's features of the Gotham platform that I'm unaware of. Looking through their promotional pages I don't see anything outside of that.

The company still has great potential but the expectation that this will moon because they're entering the private sector is high hoping.

Likewise, to my fellow GameStop/GME GANG BULLS: The longer we wait, the bigger our reward. **Let me explain.**

Let's assume shorts haven't even covered yet (and many analysts say they haven't), then the bigger our initial investment capital to be multiplied to theoretical infinity, and that's not even counting our call options (juicy gamma squeeze, anyone?). Now, let's do some math.

**Assumptions:**

• Assume C(n) is 'zero point', prior to squeeze; where 'C' is initial capital, and 'n' is all the compounded multiplier *prior* to the deadly short squeeze. Basically, it's just your total capital multiplied by organic % growth. It's some king shit. Let's say that C(e) is ending capital. Remember the 'compound interest is king' worship on subs like r/investing? Well, my fellow retards, this is compound interest on fucking steroids so scientifically advanced it hasn't even been birthed yet.

• Assume days-to-cover is about 6 as per avg. daily volume and number of shares shorted needing to be unwound, under a 100% of float shorted scenario (which, in our case, is actually 250%-300%+. Who knows how that shit plays out. (I like to play conservative: positive surprise is better than negative.)) (edit: some folks say that the average volume in the past few days has risen by 'x' amount. Might be true, but it could also die down to an averaged baseline since the volume spike was more organic buying imo. Also, consider that the *current* short % of float is **260.91%\*\*\*\*** as of writing (Yahoo! Finance, Dec. 20, 2020 data). That's good for Longs, *absolutely fucking terrifying* for shorts given current circumstances. Take from that as you will.)

•Assume 50% increase in share price (SP) per day during short squeeze panic. (Even that's probably conservative, but, who knows. I'm not a fortune teller.)

Then;

**MOASS (conservative) Price Target (PT) = (SP)(1.5)\^6**

**and C(e) = C(n) x ((SP)(1.5)\^6)/SP)**

Think about that for a sec.

Now, let's assume shorts will start to cover for their **goddamn souls** by **SP=$50**. Then;

**Price Target (PT) = ($50)(1.5)\^6**

**Price Target (PT) = $569.53.\*\***

Let's stagger this down to steps by change-per-day so it's easier to visualize, following above assumptions:

>Day 0 (D0): $50 (+0%, zero point)  
>  
>Day 1 (D1): $75 (+50% from D0) = 1.5-bagger  
>  
>Day 2: $112.50 (+50% from D1) = 2-bagger  
>  
>Day 3: $168.50 (+50% from D2) = 3-bagger  
>  
>Day 4: $253.125 (+50% from D3) = 5-bagger  
>  
>Day 5: $379.6875 (+50% from D4) = 7-bagger  
>  
>Day 6: $569.53125 (+50% from D5) = 11-bagger

**Literally an 11-bagger in a matter of 6 days by conservative day-over-day 'squeeze' growth estimates.** (edit: I'm adding a variation factor, or randomness factor as I want to call it, of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, just to cover our bases. I've read more on other people's MOASS PTs, and the 11-bagger seems to be on the upper end (I will not retract the PT though, and I am confident in the mathematical power of exponential compounding, esp. in this historical short squeeze data on GME). I enjoy the fact, however, that by consensus, we all agree on the whopping potential multiples this short squeeze can generate.**\*\*\*\*\*\***) (edit: There's been comments about the massive sell-walls at $420.69, hence, it could curtail any share price growth beyond that point. If it even reaches that point, that would be fucking hilarious. Even funnier at $694.20.)

**$TSLA performance 1-yr to date is an 8-bagger.** (Shoutout to our TSLA brothers, we love you and shit. GME gang will join you in tendie-land soon.)

The legendary **VW Short Squeeze** was a little under 5-bagger over the course of several days, and even then,

**I will quote DOMO Capital\*\*\* on a recent example:**

>it took [$APRN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APRN&src=cashtag_click) 3-4 days to squeeze.  
>  
>Day 1: Up as high a 86%, closed up 68%  
>  
>Day 2: Up as high as 96% closed up 71%  
>  
>Day 3: Up as high as 198% closed up 148%  
>  
>Day 4: Up as high as 77% closed down 12%  
>  
>$2.25 to $28.84 at peak  
>  
>That was without >100% SI

**You read that right. That was without >100% SI. And in this example, $APRN was a 13-bagger (+1281.77%) over the course of 3-4 days.** **Meanwhile, our hypothetical GME scenario above yielded an 11-bagger (+1100%) after 6 days, on (imo) conservative day-over-day short squeeze spikes of 50%.** I know that +1000%+ looks almost impossible on paper. Sure, maybe as an isolated, singular event. But stretch that over to multiple days with compounding interest overwhelmingly in your favor, and you can get there in no time (if you're still confused about that, re-read the visualized step-by-step change-per-day above). That's why you can have small initial capital amounts grow into millions of dollars after many years of passive investing, but, that's for r/investing to talk about.

[+7&#37; YoY index investing growth until age 65? We don't do that here. 1000&#37;+ or bust bitch](https://preview.redd.it/hkz8itzf3db61.jpg?width=1046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74375f3871fc0664f10d154d404a03eae1f6a339)

GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. They have to cover eventually, and the water boils hot by the second. 

What catalysts can be 'surpriseful' enough to lead shorts to cover to their deaths, you might ask? Who knows. What I do know, however, and something which has NOW BEEN PROVEN to be validated by (at the very least) recent price action alone, is that sweet sugar daddy Ryan Cohen and our CHWY daddies Alan Attal and Jim Grube *know what they're doing.* Who knows what kind of walls they'll be breaking in these coming days, weeks, or months. And each and any of them can become the flashy red nuclear button to send this bitch running. (edit: Jim Cramer had a segment on Mad Money today about the ripe-ness of GME to fucking SQUEEZE INTO MOASS.\*\*\*\*\* You read that right: GME + MOASS potential + CRAMER. He also seems to love WSB, and probably jacks off to our gains. Hi Cramer! See link below: thanks to u/CPTHubbard for sharing the link.)

Then again, I might be retarded as fuck, take these assumptions with a grain of salt. Long live WSB, and long live GME gang.

**Bonus:** "but u/fieryskyes, how do I know when the tip has topped?"

*My* answer: Who knows. Feel free to set yourself a limit sell, or not. Just remember that MM's and many other advanced traders can see your limit sells (e.g. $420.69) via Level II data. If (and that's an if) and when the MOASS starts to happen, you will know. WSB will be going apeshit about it. With regards to my own *personal* strategy, I'll be watching the price spike *actively* over the span of the days it squeezes. No limit sell, no stop loss.. I'd rather see the price peak to the highest peak, knowing it has maxed out, and then catch it as it freefalls, than SELLING too early without having even seen the peak yet. Seeing the glorious green dildo peak is ejaculatory enough for me, and I'll be ready to unwind shortly \[pun intended\] as it falls. *But then again,* that's just my personal preference on the play. There could be better plays, in which I'd be open to exploring.

**TL;DR: Under the assumptions written above, GME MOASS Price Target is potentially an 11-bagger on conservative estimates over a 6-day period, and the short squeeze (reportedly) hasn't even begun yet. GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. Join now, or die in FOMO forever.**

\*\*- for our fundamentalists, $BBY (Best Buy) as of writing is currently at $114.84 with $29.72B Market Cap. $GME (GameStop) at $39.46 is at $2.752B market cap. BBY is just about 11x of GME. At 11x Mkt Cap, GME would be priced at roughly \~$430. A lot of assumptions here, sure, but I'm putting this here just to put share and market cap sizing into context.

\*\*\*\*\*\*: possibly final edit: I've been browsing through other MOASS Price targets, and seems like my range is up the upper end so far. For that reason, I'm including a variation range of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, to account for randomness, and just to cover our bases. The key thing to note is that MOASS price targets are in whopping multiples of current SP. I will not retract the 11-bagger PT, as it just shows the power of exponential compounding interest in a once-in-a-lifetime MOASS scenario, given our current data on GME and its boiling rocket fuel.
