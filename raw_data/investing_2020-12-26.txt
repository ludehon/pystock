 Some portfolio ideas - please tell me why and why not Hello guys, hope to get some high quality discussion and great advices in the comments. To sum things up, I have been investing for only one year - so I started small, just in case I totally failed I do not lose all my money. That being said, I only bought physical gold and silver, which I do not plan to sell anytime soon, I consider it as an insurance policy, not an investment. Other than that, I have some crypto, mostly in BTC, that I bought few months ago and it doubled since - and I might consider selling it anytime soon because I believe it could crash as it is overbought, in my opinion.

So, here I am trying to allocate my money, and to make my first portfolio. I am young and am able to take more risks than somebody that is older, just as I have time to wait for things to raise if they fall. Of course, this does nit mean I will just buy random stocks and gamble around. Please do not hate me or troll me, I am just trying to educate myself and make my future better.

First of all, I am not huge fan of cash. Although there are good times to hold it, saving it on bank account just make it inflate and lose its value over time. And I am scared this trend could become even faster, given the current economy situation. So I will have it just enough for living and as insurance.

Next, I like tech stocks, but I am not sure that just buying Apple, Tesla and Microsoft would be wise - everybody is in that atm, and it is really expensive. The same applies with other hot stocks, in my opinion looking for something cheap and hated that has potential in the future is better way to go. But prove me wrong, if I am.

Here are some of my ideas, and I am looking for your opinion, feel free to give other things if you think it could work. First, I might consider buying some American company, because if USD inflates, this fights against. However, not anything is a good option. How about things like miners of Lithium? Or some other green tech companies? Given the new president of the US, just as general political trends, there might be some space to grow. Solar energy? Food companies? Those are just some ideas.

Next, I am thinking about gold and silver miners, but not sure if I would put a lot of money there.

Also, what is your opinion on emerging markets? There are also some cheap things. Chinesse weinbergs? Restaurants are going to re open soon. Russian shipyards? Maybe some airlines companies? Why yes or why not? On the one hand those things could start moving soon, but also it is unlikely they will recover completely soon.

As you see, I do not have plan yet. I am not going to buy things tonight or tomorrow. I am just looking for places to put my money in, and want to hear your opinion. What are your portfolios consisted of and why you have chosen certain things over others.

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Arguments against "genomic revolution"? I am in the tech space so have had the luxury of understanding some fundamentals on "why" some tech stocks have mooned the past few years.  Like I have a pulse on it, and tend to invest in what I know, which is usually sound advice for investors.

But "genomics", pharma, health industry I don't have as good a feel.  It's been bubbling up as a sort of renaissance lately for stocks like CRSP and EDIT.  Gene splicing and DNA modifications to me sounds as foreign as computer architecture does to a biologist.  Cathy's been pushing a "genomic revolution" since at least 2018 from what I've looked at.

That being said I'd like to learn and understand at an ELI5 level.  What are arguments against this field and related stocks?  Speaking strictly of humans, some stuff I can come up with is stuff like this of modifying DNA would be heavily regulated by governments.  A failing trial can cause the stock to plunge.  I don't know anything about how patents/licensing can work here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are people panicking about "USD losing value" if Fed can stop "printing it" and rise rates in future? First of all, I'm not an economist, I'm an idiot, so my questions will probably sound really stupid...

Why do people talk as if Fed were idiots and didn't realise that constant "USD printing" can cause lessening trust in USD and inflation.

They are fully aware of that.

So if they "printed" all this money during the Corona crisis (because of the crisis). Then why do people assume they will keep doing it forever and will ruin the trust in USD and cause "uncontrolled inflation". They can increase rates, correct? They can just stop printing this much, correct?

So why do people panic about "new world order", "great reset", "new currency" and "USD being dethroned"?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Play Like some of you, I jumped into the PLTR train before it took off, and have been adding shares since then.

Do you, as an option holder (option buyer), now own the shares OR does the option writer (option seller) keep the shares?

They have collected a lot of materials and have interviewed a lot workers.

Check the Chinese article here: https://www.pingwest.com/a/226110_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Differences in portfolio holdings between Morningstar & Yahoo! Finance Hello, 

There seem to be *significant* differences in the portfolio between Yahoo! Finance and Morningstar for some of the ETFs I've checked. Why would this be and who to believe? 

For example, Yahoo! Finance shows NIO as a top holding (10%) of MOON where as Morningstar does not show NIO as a top holding at all! 

To a lesser degree, Morningstar shows CRWD as a top holding in LRNZ while Yahoo! Finance does not. 

Why is there this discrepancy between the two? And whose report should I go with? (I avoid Chinese companies, so I'm avoiding MOON based on what Yahoo! Finance reports as a top holding, but want to make sure). 

Thank you for your feedback. Much appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSTG Guys, I just found Pure Storage a couple of months ago (NYSE: PSTG) and I think it's a really good stock. It just jumped 50% up from november. The company has more than 3000 employees and they are produceing and selling all-flash storages for companies. They have customers from all around the world, and according to the technical analysis this stock is looking really bullish in the future. If you are interested in technology stocks, it might worth a look._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeking advice for Investment suggestions with two scenarios. Hi, I will be short in my description.

Location: Europe  


I got 50K to invest. I have two desired scenarios and goals, in order of preference:

1) **Passive income, low risk**. 

Passive ways I have tried: 

a) **Deposit to bank**. Practically passive income with 0 risk, but returns are too low to keep 50k for long period. **Works**.

b) **Real estate**. Works fine so far. Bought an apartment that already has a renter who is willing to stay till death. **Works**.

What I have **not** tried: 

a) **P2P lending**.  Although I'm familiar with the concept, few questionable reviews made  me have second thoughts. Have not tried this yet. Any recommendations  would be appreciated.   


b) **Stock exchange & bonds**. Simple have not tried it yet.   


c) **Forex**. Would only do it if I could find someone trustworthy to pay him to manage my funds and get an income out of it.

d) Some **investment program**  usually offered by insurance companies. Works like a second pension  after 15 years. For 8 years minimum you have to pay per month an amount.  


2) **Offshore**. Starting with 0 experience. Is is possible to start an offshore to have reduced taxes?

An Air Canada Boeing 737 Max aircraft flying from Arizona to Montreal, Canada, was forced into an unscheduled landing because of an engine problem, the airline said Friday.

The aircraft was diverted soon after take off on December 22 when the crew received an "engine indication" and "decided to shut down one engine," the airline said.

the three crew members were the only people on board.

Boeing 737 Max aircraft were grounded for 18 months following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people — although the engines were not implicated. Airlines began using them again in early December.

ESG (Environmental Social & Governance) is become increasingly popular in the investing universe with a wide range of fund managers claiming that investing in companies with sustainable revenue sources lead to superior returns. However, the literature surrounding this topic is mixed and there does not seem to be a clear cut answer. Key Questions: Do people think that ESG investing should always form part of investing decisions and should poorly rated ESG investments be left well alone? Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Keeping Track of News: Long Term Positions Ive got 6 long term dividend positions i've been holding for 5 years, and while ive subscribed to newsletters and updates, i still seem to be blindsided by information that comes out. obviously, some of this will never be known. but some of it can be.   


What methods do yall use to keep up to date on your long term positions? i'd like to be better about this going into the new year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ OAC / For Hims Update: Up 50% from Original Recommendation - Still 100%+ Near Term Upside Remaining A few weeks ago I posted [the following due diligence (including a link to a PDF of my due diligence, primarily focusing on valuation metrics).](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k82l9l/recap_on_prpl_80_gain_achieved_new_idea_with_3400/)

Since then, the shares have gained, increasing from \~$10.50 or so (and $1.50 a warrant) to about $15/share as of 12/24 and the warrants are now close to $4.00. We are still awaiting the official merger date though SEC filings indicate preparations are underway with amendments to the S-4 on 12/2 and as recently as 12/22. 

As the due diligence linked to above lays out, there is an argument that For Hims' valuation positions the business to trade at $30-$40 assuming the market comps the business similar to AMWL, TDOC, LVGO given its top tier growth, profitability, and market potential. Hims is growing at nearl 90% YoY and has 75%+ gross margins. Incredible - better than a lot of software businesses. 

Following various analyst meetings Oaktree and Hims conducted, interest has built in the story, including a brand new 1.2MM share position from Falcon Edge Capital, another brand new position of 600K shares from BlueCrest (third largest hedge fund in Europe), 200K shares from JP Morgan Asset Management, and 300K new position from FNY Investment advisers. Most of these positions were reported as of 9/30, so there has no doubt been more activity since then. Additionally, none of the founders or the VCs invested in For Hims are selling anything in the SPAC transaction, and the PIPE is ONLY $75MM (vs. what is typical - $2-300MM+ which can create post combination overhang). 

I've seen some posts saying that For Hims is just a shampoo company or just "sells dick pills" and is commoditized. A few thoughts - first, For Hims provides telehealth through virtual consults (typically free) followed by easy fulfillment of prescription and non-Rx medications and treatments. It is not just a digital pharmacy and it sells more than just shampoo. It's focus areas are in sexual, dermatology, hair care, behavioral, and other services focusing on what are typically non-reimbursable parts of healthcare. Secondly, the business today is nearly 50-60% in sexual/ED with 40% in the other categories. ED still a big focus, but was their first entry into the market. 

Are they commoditized and how do they compare against the dozens of other online ED companies? First, they are the most recognized brand and digital presence. They smoke Roman (declining engagement) and Lemonaid (barely known). Other companies are typically one trick ponies focusing only on one category. 

Separately, think about where this market is going. Amazon is getting into digital pharma and WalMart, CVS, Walgreens are all desperate to stay relevant and engage customers more holistically to combat Amazon and others. All those companies stand to lose as healthcare goes digital. Guess how they can fix that? An acquisition of the leading consumer telehealth platform. 

Hims is both a short term and long term value creation opportunity that is significant._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stick with $STIC pre-merger?  

Think investing in $STIC pre-BARK merger, but debating on when to enter pre or post merger. Looking at all 47 SPACs from Jan 19' to June 20', unless they were backed by a high quality sponsor (e.g. high profile PE firm), they not only were outperformed by the market post-merger, but they actually went down by 14%!

https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/19/a-sober-look-at-spacs/

I really like the BARK DD and think its got legs, but not clear how or why this SPAC will be different from the others given the dilution of equity in SPAC structure. Any SPAC experts can tell me otherwise?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Burford Capital a good investment? Burford Capital is a litigation finance company (very basically: they give money to plantifs to hire lawyers to sue people). There one of 2 public litigation finance companies and the industry is growing fast. After going public the famed hetchfund Muddy Watters disclosed a big short position and a accompanying research report that coincidently said it was a Enron like fraud (no surprise). Since then the company has bounced back with responses to different parts of the report. After popping its about back to where it started when it first listed not to long ago (IPO<1 year). Because of its volatility I'm not saying I want to invest a lot but just a small percent of my portfolio._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Moonshot Innovation ETF?

I have about $200,000 in a savings account that I would like to invest in Vanguard mutual funds. I don't want to buy in all at once due to market fluctuation. (I don't want to put in $200,000 one day, only to have a correction the next week and lose a large sum overnight.)

So I'll buy the funds in increments -- like, a fixed amount every week or month -- but I'm unsure how quickly I should buy in. Is there a rule of thumb to guide this sort of thing?

For context, my income is about $150,000 a year and I already have more than enough in an emergency fund, etc. The $200,000 investment will be long-term (at least fifteen years, barring any unexpected financial emergencies) and I'll buy mostly VTSAX with it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV supply chain investments I believe in the future of EV, whether it be tomorrow or in 5 -10 years I am confident EV is the future, or Atleast will have significant market share in the future.

I own Tesla through an ETF which is really my only EV play at the moment.

The Fed and the US Federal gov't are determined to keep the markets/economy propped up until some normalcy returns. The dividend yields on REITs look tasty, but I realize there is a slight risk with them. J. Powell/the Fed has stated they are committed to keeping interest rates low through 2021 and possibly through 2023. Does this not beckon stable returns on qualified dividends for REITs? Some REITs buy mortgage backed securities (MBS) from an agency like the US (Ex: Freddie Mac) at a \~2% int. rate and then see a higher return from the interest on the individual mortgages which may pay \~4% return. This is just an example, but I wanted to get someone's thoughts on this. If interest rates stay low enough, REITs could see a consistent cash flow for potentially the next 4 - 8 quarters?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Companies with Zero retail investors. Meaning?

They acquire a shit ton of companies (mostly in India). More than 60 percent of all their assets consist of goodwill. As Graham said a 'serial acquirer'. Is this a major warning or is this not that important.

Their investor presentation has also a dedicated page for the CEO with news about him (UGH). CEO looks like a major douche in general. Makes it not look very professional. 

They also recently bought Trimax, India’s Bus Exchange Leader powering Bus roadways of 18 states.

Any information helps, thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CSCO + time in market I bought 150 shares of CSCO 10 years ago (now 198 via DRIP)- and have been holding since I bought them  and forgot about my account until about a year ago where I actively started investing again. The CSCO share price has only doubled in this timeframe. Is there a benefit (compound interest?) in keeping it for even longer or would it be better to sell and invest in a higher growth stock? It makes up about 8% of my portfolio now.   I’m not clear how compound interest could potentially work in this scenario. 

For reference, I’m 38. I have a 401k and sufficient cash savings. The rest of the portfolio is AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, ARKG, ICLN (all new buys) and VFIAX mutual fund (original buy 10 years ago)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ P/E Ratio For a company like Tesla, with a P/E ratio of 1.29K, does this mean that for every 1 dollar gain, people are willing to pay $1,290 dollars per stock?

Also, what is considered a "high" or "low" P/E ratio? All the examples online just say high or low but no real numbers.

Apparently on past examples/posts, this means that for every $1,290 worth of stock I buy, I get in return $1 of earnings. This doesn't make sense as my gains on this company is well over $1 per stock that I own._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is everyone’s opinion of DIS?

Appreciate your response!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help me with this one I want to invest with 10 different margin brokers! So I have 10 margin accounts with 10(BP is 500) different well known brokers , how to use the maximum number of  day trades from those 10 brokers and and not break the PDT rule? I’m thinking to use 7 of them Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, and 3 Thursday and Friday so that’s 7x3=21 and 3x3=9 that’s 30 trades during 5 business days

Let me know if you tell me you are stupid ( that won’t harm me :) )_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some insights on a company that you've researched that you think most people might not be aware of? Examples:

Palantir supposedly has one of the toughest interview processes out of all the tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and so on. Even though software engineering is a field where it's notoriously hard to determine who is actually a skilled engineer, there is the possibility that PLTR has the best and brightest software engineers out of most tech companies.

Unity software isn't just for video games. But it has potential to be extended to creating all manner of interactive 3D software in general. For example doing VR training simulation for jobs, or VR education (traveling back to ancient Rome in a history class). The bull case would be that Unity eventually becomes the Adobe for 3D interactive content.

Lemonade plans on releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months (based off of the latest interview I've watched with the CEO). Their software is designed in such a way that it is easy to do this. A lot of people who've done preliminary research on Lemonade, believes that they just do renter's insurance and are sticking with that. But 3 months ago they've released pet insurance. They're planning on releasing life insurance next month, and then there's the possibility of car insurance afterwards.  The CEO has also stated that he understands the importance of intersecting humanity's (art/design) with tech, and that this is a valuable way to capture one of the most scarce commodities, mindshare. Which is why the "Lemonade app's workflow looks and feels a lot better than going on Geico, Statefarm, Allstate, etc..." (CFO's words, not mine).

Also I was just trying to give examples._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Naked Puts In Margin Account I want to make sure people employ this strategy and was wondering if its safe and yet profitable in long run. 

If one uses RH to invest into sell put options, it holds on the entire amount as collateral. However, if using margin account in TDAmeritrade it only holds some amount of money and not entire amount. If one does sell put on companies like Apple, Microsoft, etc. mainly reliable value stocks, and be very conservative that is a 30% below their average price for 6 months out, and earn premiums, and then repeat the same exercise on expiration. Isn't this super conservative and stress-free way of making money? Because first companies like Apple, Google, etc. won't just hit down 30-40% of their original price and even if they do, it will be well worth of an investment. Also, in margin account they don't even hold the entire funds. 

Please let me know your thoughts, just trying to see why not lot of people employ this strategy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I was gifted stock credit for Stockpile, the app. How do I learn how to use it best? My goal this year was to learn how to invest. My parents gifted me a gift card to Stockpile, an app and website. They chose Tesla and Amazon stocks for me, but I guess I can actually use the credit for any of their offerings. 

I know nothing, where do I learn the basics for this purpose, and good investment practices in general?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do people mean when they say they don't let an asset be more than X % of their portfolio? One might hear for example not to let a given asset make up more than 10% of a portfolio. I initially understood this as not *putting in* more than 10% of your money into some asset. So if you've got 10k, no more than 1k. But let's say hypothetically that asset starts doing really well and it doubles while the rest of the portfolio stays the same. Well now that asset is 18.18% of your portfolio (2k over 11k). Is the above advice implying you sell that asset and spread the extra profit into the remainder of the portfolio to rebalance things? To me that seems weird... if it's doing well and you have good reason to believe it will continue doing so, why transfer money from it to some asset that may not do as well? I feel like the idea is to reduce the risk you take on so that you are not overexposed to any particular asset, but I feel like that's relevant only to when you make the initial investment. After that, you're not taking on any more or less risk; you're money is already in there._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When two financial institutions merge, when is the SIPC protection for an individual owning a brokerage account in both places reduced?

So EA recently acquired some company that makes racing car games, for $1.2Billion

They are effectively saying that the old companies offices, employees, capital, market, previous games all sum up to roughly 1.2B

So they lose that value in liquid cash but gain that value in physical property that can be resold later or made a profit off of in the future if it does well.



In a way its kind of like buying a stock on the market...

I guess my question would roughly be, why do these companies choose to invest 1.2B to acquire a company instead of trying to make a profit from smartly investing $1.2B around the stock market?

It seems like the market would be "easier" due to less complex overhead and more liquidity.

 Is it because buying a company could theoretically return profit margins much higher than you could realistically make from trading stocks?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Get Ready for the Great U.S. Inflation Mirage of 2021 >The story of U.S. inflation in 2021 could very well amount to this: It’s all a mirage.

>With prices also climbing for some inputs such as copper and lumber, inflation could very well reach or surpass the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in some months.

I am looking to understand which stocks or securities I should hold in a scenario where we get high reported inflation and subsequent increase in interest rates during the coming years. I understand this scenario will be bearish for many stocks but I do not wish to short stocks or similar. It would be interesting if you would like to describe your vision for how a gradual increase up to interest rates of 7 % over 5-10 years would affect the most important assets such as housing, commodities, bonds, dividend stocks, growth stocks, and cryptocurrencies.

I'm a software developer but ML is not really my strength. AWS appears to have so many ML services these days so I thought of giving few of them a try. Is there a way I use these services to create some models that can do rudimentary predictions, for day trading for example (buy low sell high).

I know people do this and some have some success and many don't. If I can at least create a solution that's more right then wrong I think it's still a success. Would love to know more about what you have tried and where is a good starting point. Or is this not worth it for someone like myself? 

My other question is what's a good place to get data. I'm willing to pay for it just to play around with it. I know yahoo used to have a lot of data provided for free but I had some difficulty getting it for free recently.

Thank you in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is the risk of the B.1.1.7 COVID-19 mutation priced in? As many of you know, a new COVID strain was discovered a few months ago in the UK that is cause of concern for many. It is estimated that the new strain is about [56% more transmissible than preexisting variants of COVID-19](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/uk-novel-variant.html)

You can read more about the new mutation here:

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/mutant-coronavirus-united-kingdom-sets-alarms-its-importance-remains-unclear

https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/22/the-new-mutations#comment-335384

Some might say that this is a nothingburger, but there is sufficient proof that this is a worrisome anomaly. The graphs of daily new infections per million people are showing [exponential growth in UK and Netherlands despite restrictions continuing and even tightening on the past few weeks.](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-08-31..latest&country=GBR~USA~NLD~DEU~ITA~FRA~CAN&region=World&casesMetric=true&interval=smoothed&hideControls=true&perCapita=true&smoothing=7&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc)

It is likely that the new mutation is already in many other countries, and we might start seeing exponential growth in daily new infections over the next few weeks. 

It is unclear whether the new strain is more or less deadly, but we should find that out in a few weeks. 

Vaccines are expected to immunize against this new strain. 

If the new strain is really 56% more infectious, the current immunization schedule will not be able to stop this new mutation from spreading through the population. It is unclear if current restrictions will slow down this new mutation enough to keep the R0 under 1. 

So the questions are:

Will governments enact even harsher restrictions, similar to the ones enacted in April 2020?

Will society follow these restrictions, or is society too fatigued with being locked down?

If restrictions are enacted, will more stimulus come?

and finally, how will the markets react when they wake up and realize what this new mutation really is?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Better Savings Account High-yield savings accounts have been pretty popular. Everyone was glad to go from 0.01% interest to 2.00% with the same safety of FDIC. Inspired by u/cbus20122, I will start putting a portion of my Emergency Savings into a low-risk portfolio that I can still withdraw quickly enough. The rest I will keep in the HYSA to keep it immediately available.

I played around with [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com) to get an idea of what can be expected, such as steady but slow growth and limited drawdowns in downturns. I recommend you backtest with the asset class allocation, since these go back further than relatively newly established ETFs like BND and GLD, but you can do those, too, to look at varying ETFs.

I personally will start out with SPYG, BNDW, and VCSH. You can see [an example here](https://ibb.co/KN4M9nY) of what it somewhat looks like going back to 1994. This assumes an initial investment with no additions, only rebalancing yearly.

Ideally, you would want the max drawdown to be as little as possible since that is likely when you'll need to access the emergency savings. I know this isn't for everyone, but I'm willing to try something else than just let it sit, losing to inflation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I sell my microsoft stock and buy PLTR? Hi guys,

I'm an engineer at Microsoft and have over $80k in Microsoft stock. I sold the first lot of long term stock (\~$40k) because I want to diversify and have already doubled my money.
