 How many companies fail an EIA or next stage because of the public consultation?  

I'm just wondering. I hear mainly the public consultation is often just a formality in mining applications. I'm not sure what counterparts in other businesses/etc are. Interested because I wonder if there's a form of arbitrage that can be applied to this, derisking, etc._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Using probability and Kelly Criterion for investment sizing I recently ran into the problem of deciding how to split money into different assets (more specifically stocks and bonds). The idea is that the investment size should be a function of the probabilities of receiving the cash flows, and the cash flows themselves. For a company this could be the future free cash flows, and for a bond it would be the future coupons.

My first attempt was assuming one would either lose all their money, or make a specific profit. I tried multiplying each expected profit with the probability of me getting it (implying that the probability of total loss is 1 - P(profit)), and then doing the same for all other investment opportunities. Consequently, I added all the terms, and each term divided by the total would give me its share of the total portfolio. But there were several problems with this approach:

1. It is too black and white. In reality there are multiple outcomes, not just profit and bankruptcy. If I have the probabilities of partial winnings and partial profits, I should be able to use this extra information for better approximations.

2. It is illogical for special cases. If I have an investment opportunity with a winning probability of 100% and cash flows higher than other opportunities, then my calculation would not tell me to put 100% of my money into it, which is obviously irrational because of the high profit and zero risk.

Later I stumbled upon the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing and tried applying it. Again, I faced the black and white problem, but then also the fact that I couldn't generalize it to more than one bet, because the Kelly Formula is meant for single bets. In the end I found some articles detailing solutions to my problems, but the math was way to complicated for me to comprehend.

If someone has a way of dealing with asset allocation in this manner, as a function of cash flows and probabilities, please comment below.

It seems like a company could really take advantage of public investors by constantly diluting their ownership A few companies I'm invested in (RDFN and NCLH) have recently done stock offerings and the share price understandably drops immediately after.  It means that if I used to own 100 shares out of 1 million for example, I now only own 100 shares out of 1.1 million.  In other words, my stake in the company has been reduced wtihout my approval.

Lot's of other companies have been raising money through offerings lately.  TSLA, DKNG, AMC, CCL, PLUG, just to name a few.

Curious if there is any data about the short, long and cash position of institutional investors. I am well awere of the SEC filings, but I am looking for an aggregate measure of the current market participation.

 \- is smart money more short or long; and how is the current position relative to past positions?

\- are institutional investors still largely in cash or are they already with leverage invested?

&#x200B;

Such data could be extremely helpful in anticipating market turns ...

Any suggestions?

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

It seems the most important benefit of investing in private real estate is the potential to use **leverage** to boost both capital appreciation and yield. Provided there is enough net yield to cover interest and mortgage payments, eventually, as you start paying off the debt, you could achieve a pretty strong return. Assuming a 2% growth rate in the capital value, with a 20% deposit you are leveraging at 5X. If you were to maintain this LTV ratio of 80%, you'd basically be getting 10% IRR excluding interest expenses/yield. Of course, if the yield increases or you can produce a net yield after interest, you are getting some uplift there too. It wouldn't be inconceivable to manage 20% IRR.

Stocks might net 5-7% per annum (without making any significant, optimistic assumptions). Using leverage with stocks is generally ill-advised as even 2X "LTV" could/would get you margin-called in a recessionary crash (e.g. Q1 2020).

So, I'm thinking, what important elements am I missing here? Excluding the geographical risk of the property, which is no doubt important to consider. But with enough properties (long term) you could achieve some degree of diversification (albeit not to the extent afforded by stock index funds)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to structure a Step-down Kickout plan Before Covid, i remember seeing various kick out plans, they worked as follows:

1) You invest your capital of say 100k. If at the end of year 1, the index is greater than 105% of the FTSE 100's start date level, the plan matures and you get your capital back plus 8% return.

2) if the ftse is less than 105% a year later, it doesn't mature, and instead continues for another year. This time if the ftse is greater than 102.5% of its starting level, you get 116% return, otherwise it repeats for another year. Each year the reference level decreases, and you get an extra 8% on maturity. 

3)this goes on eventually until the policy finally kicks out, or else you it reaches the end of say 10 years, in which case you lose some of your capital.

From reading the brochures on them and Googling, i still can't decipher what sort of suite of investments and options would allow a provider to offer this type of structured product. It seems like you would want to be very unlucky for it to go the 10 years and not Kickout.
What do they use to make these structured products? What makes them appealing to the company offering them?
Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm become big enough to disrupt the credit card industry, payment processors, and card networks? I see these Buy Now Pay Later services absolutely everywhere now. Seems like it’s rarer to find an online store that doesn’t have one or more of these as a payment option. 

I’m sure they represent just a small percentage of total ecommerce transactions still, but given their growth it seems completely possible that they grow to a point where they are taking real share away from traditional credit and debit card purchases (since using BNPL totally bypasses these traditional payment rails), which impacts credit card issuers like Chase and Amex and also the card networks like Visa and Mastercard. It also impacts traditional card payment processors like a Stripe or Adyen.
