 30 Days of Breakouts in the New Energy Vehicles Space The past 30 days have seen a lot of action as the renewable energy stocks topped out and investors spilled into new energy vehicles stocks. 

There has been mostly upward volatile drama in the closely-watched Chinese EV (ChEV) space with the trio of stocks NIO, XPEV and LI, and there are now spikes showing in other green shoots, including KNDI (up 75% so far this week) and even NKLA (up 22% so far this week). 

US EV maker FSR also rose sharply starting last Friday (up 15% since then). Commercial truck new energy vehicle stocks WKHS (up 19% for the week) & HYLN (up 12% for the week) are also up modestly. 

Finally, TSLA snapped up 16% so far this week on news of being added to the S&P 500 index.

I see that their top 10 holdings are quite similar, with similar companies within a close range of sectors. Why is it, then, that the Put/Call ratio of ARKK so much higher than ARKW? Especially since ARKK pays dividends, meaning wouldn't shareholders have MORE incentive to hold to let the Dividends compound?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy Mattel! No joke!!

My research steps:
1. Find the stock I like.
2. Look how it’s doing the past year or 5 years.
3. Yahoo finance and see if it’s overvalued and see the analyst sector to see if it’s a buy, hold or sell.
4. Go to the financials and look at the EBITDA, PEG and current ratio. 
5. Look at the earning.
6. Look at the company and see if I actually like and think they’re a good company to grow.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/google-moves-into-venmo-and-banking-turf-with-checking-account-app.html_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ By air or sea? (Airlines or Cruise) I'm going in big on either UAL or NCL for the recovery. Pfizer will be approved within 1-2 weeks, and I want in before then.  

I'm new to investing, but I have a lot of background on airlines. I don't know anything about cruise ships, other than I've been on one and they're the worst. BUT, there's obviously great opportunities here either way. I don't mind holding for 2-3 years. The question is, where do you park the money. 

UAL-Number one airline in the states. Most stable airline in the industry, has been on the incline for years (many others were heading down) and once international travel opens up, they will rocket. Granted, business travel won't be back for years if ever (and they rely on it heavily), but of all airlines they stand the most to gain down 55ishpts on the year (their peak season).  At least the first year after vaccine, it won't matter. Nobody's been out of the house for a year, and tack on a long winter and EVERYONE will be flying as soon as they can. Family, friends, vacations, the year will be crazy and I don't think they'll miss too much from business.  

NCL-After that offering yesterday I feel like they're on discount for 5-7pts. They are now trading down 60pts on the year.. They have also been on the incline in recent years. 

The times coming will not be normal for a while, I realize that. But in 2019:  


UAL in 2019- Highs: trading between **$80-90** (holiday season)  Low for the whole year was **$77**, which then shot back up to **80s**. Currently trading at **$41-42.** 

NCL in 2019-They stayed in the **$40-50** range and peaked right around **$60** before covid hit. Currently trading at $20-21ish. Once cruises start again, up they go. Granted, they still have to prove they're not just covid outbreak boats, which could take a while. Let's say they get to $50 within two years. That's well over 100 percent return, and they still have room to grow, assuming everything's ship shape (sorry..I'm a dad). On the flipside, I can see United being in the 60s by june, 70s by christmas 2021. I have no idea what the cruise industry will do..but I believe they'll get back to 40 in the near-ish future (a year or two(..which is 100 percent.  Again, I don't mind holding

  
I think airlines will make a quicker recovery with the beginning surge and then be flat till the holidays. I think cruises will be a slower, more gradual recovery, but is there's more potential profit here.   


I know the secure move is United. They ain't goin bankrupt no way no how. Even if they're surprised with another hit somehow, the government won't let it happen (and united would be the last airline to go anyway).

2. Which growth stocks outside the big tech (FAANGM)with high chance of growth now that pandemic wil end soon. 


3. Which would have more returns large cap growth or mid-small cap growth?

Credit Suisse Group initiated coverage on CureVac in a report on Tuesday, September 8th. They issued a neutral rating and a $68.00 target price on the stock.

So Curevac is massively overvalued, currently sitting at around $74.

I've been holding this for a few months, and am thinking of taking profits - but it seems more likely than not that Curevac will continue to grow seeing as their vaccine doesn't need sub zero storage.

Back on November 14th, PR Newswire reported that this law group [Pomerantz](https://www.pomerantzlaw.com) filed a class action lawsuit against WFC for share holders who purchased between Oct 13, 2017 and, Oct 13, 2020.

&#x200B;

The suit elegies that the company "made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies." More specially to it's commercial loan procedure by not following correct due diligence guidelines while issuing "billions of dollars' worth of commercial loans, including by inflating the net income and future expected cash flows of it's commercial clients..."

&#x200B;

So WFC made some risky loans by inflating how much money these business were going to make and then lied when asked about it. The [article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pomerantz-law-firm-announces-the-filing-of-a-class-action-against-wells-fargo--company-and-certain-officers----wfc-301173156.html) goes on to say that as these loans started to unravel and effect the bottom line of WFC, it caused the stock price to fall 14% over 3 trading days. Then once the reports started to come in of their 9% loss of revenue, totaling $26.9B, it fell another 6%. (they closed at $25.61 on May 6, 2020)

It further goes on to talk about how WFC's credit profile further deteriorated as they chose to grow their reserve.

&#x200B;

I'm wondering if WFC is a long term hold anymore? I searched for "Wells Fargo Class Action lawsuit" to get more information but was met with an entire page of results from other lawsuits filed against them.

&#x200B;

The firm that is heading this one "is the oldest law firm in the world dedicated to representing the rights of defrauded investors" according to their home page. They claim to manage assets over 5 TRILLION dollars. This tells me they're not some punk attorney trying to make a buck and make something stick. They know what they're doing and one of their last suits was to the tune of 3 Billion against a Brazilian energy company.

&#x200B;

This news broke on a Saturday. The Friday before, WFC closed at $24.08, then opened Monday at $24.99. it has sense risen to $25, ($25.55 as of writing) above it's 40 day moving average.

I happened to dig into their quarterly report, and will most likely look at their SEC filing as well considering this tidbit I found. But before I do that, I'm curious as to whether y'all have any thoughts on this. 

They paid themselves the amount they lost last quarter. For the life of me, I can't pin down any concrete thoughts on this.

With the massive influx of people we saw start trading this year (myself included) supporting my claim of a growing confidence in the public's ability to make money in the market I think this recovery is completely justified due to not only the FED going BRRR but quite literally millions of people are dumping their money into stocks that have never done so before.

About 16 months ago, China´s hog population was decimated from another swine fever.

Additionally, Each person in China eats 74 pounds of pork a year. It is very Hard to change a habit like that.

About 12 months ago, Tyson has started actually making plant-based meat products, and hybrid protein products that are appealing to consumers who want to eat less meat. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-unveils-plant-based-nuggets-in-move-into-meat-alternatives.html

This is right on the back of Beyond Meat reporting an absolutely horrendous earnings report. Beyond Meat BYND, reported a loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents a share, vs. net income of $4.1 million, or 6 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue improved just 3% to $94.4 million, from $92 million a year ago. Beyond Meat has a revenue that is less that 1 percent of Tyson´s revenue.

Tyson Foods is a BEHEMOTH and it is time to start saying how can they improve as a company rather than just telling people to stop eating meat! Tyson even produces all of the chicken and most of the beef products that supplies McDonald´s corporation! Maybe farmers can start giving their cattle a different diet(Wendy´s looked into this and proved that emissions from cows can be cut drastically just on the type of feed the cattle are given). Maybe Tyson can start to build smaller and more spread out slaughtering houses so that several thousand people do not have to come together and work at one location. Maybe we should stop condemning this company that employs 145,000 extremely hard-working Americans.

Because Brazil, with their enormous animal agriculture, is simply going to fill the vacuum if companies like Tyson shrink. Before you start thinking of Tyson as the enemy, just keep in mind that Brazil actively burnt down their rainforest last year in order to clear land to have more ranches and to further expand the amount of heads of cattle they can produce. Remember that hashtag that trended on Twitter #savetherainforest for about 2 weeks and then we all forgot about it and went back to browsing the internet. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/why-brazilian-farmers-are-burning-the-rainforest--and-why-its-difficult-for-bolsonaro-to-stop-them/2019/09/05/3be5fb92-ca72-11e9-9615-8f1a32962e04_story.html

More than 30,000 fires burned in the rainforest in August alone, a nine-year high, according to the space research institute.

The fires have prompted activists to call for boycotts of Brazilian goods. Fifteen fashion labels, including Vans, Kipling and Timberland, have said they will not import Brazilian leather. Finland has called for a ban on Brazilian beef imports to the European Union.

**I hope you are all well :)**

Vaccines need to be produced and transported in specific (and cold) conditions otherwise they can be rendered ineffective; this poses a huge challenge for global drugmakers when it comes to vaccine distribution.

**There are big logistical challenges facing drugmakers!**

Do you think there are any companies that will benefit from this huge logistical challenge?

Since it came out that equivalent to the USA’s SEC in China cancelled off the Ant IPO , on Xi’s orders, just days ahead of when the IPO was to take place as a way to punishment Jack Ma days after Ma had made statements that pissed off China’s leader.

The Chinese leadership does not want to eliminate or scare international investors away from making investments in China.  Xi is not stupid, he understands that if the BABA stock continues to fall,  it will would not just be hurting Ma but hurt China, as investors would see his country as a dangerous and risky place to invest.

BABA is an inexpensive company - many posts have covered the financial angle so I am not going to cover the financials here.

So now after a 20% drop in less than two weeks, I am expecting some news to come from a Chinese agency that would calm the nerves of investors.  When that comes BABA shares would in my opinion rebound hard, and I expect it to go back to $310 or even higher in a very short time.

Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, maybe next week, I have no clue of the when, but in my opinión soon. My guess is Xi will direct his people to issue some kind of statement to ease investor minds. I would not be surprised if the Ant IPO comes back on much sooner that.  I am even willing to put money down that Xi’s inner circle, and probably Xi himself, are probably already loading up on BABA shares and options.

Again it is hard  to say the exact when,  but Xi can’t let this go much further or he risks the reputation of his equity markets.

The agency cleared the single-use test, which provides results within 30 minutes, for use by anyone aged 14 and over if their health-care provider suspects they may have Covid-19.

Produced by a privately held, California-based biotech company, Lucira Health, the kit is also eligible for use in hospitals, though patients under 14 must have their sample collected by a health-care provider.

The FDA did not reveal the price of the test. The company’s website says the test is “intended to cost less than $50.”

[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54981425](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54981425)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why the Price Earnings Ratio is meaningless I know I chose a rather offensive title for a lot of low PE Investors but let me explain a bit more why.

The Price Earnings Ratio is meaningless BY ITSELF.

I’m afraid too many People focus on a low Pe. They run their scanners when they are looking for investment opportunities and then when they find a PE of 5 they think they found the holy grail.Here are a few things that the PE won’t tell you

Worst of all :  
*“Profits are an opinion, Cash is a fact” - Alfred Rappaport*

**Are Profits really Profits?**  
Basically the management team has a lot of room to manipulate Earnings. It’s actually possible to be “profitable” but cash is flowing out of the company year after year. The “Profits” could be very misleading. Always compare the cashflows with the net profits they claim to make!

**The Company could have a lot of debt and it’s possible they can’t manage it!**  
The Price earnings ratio is based on Market cap and does not include the debt. Always look at the Enterprise Value to see the real price of a Company! 

**Sales and Earnings could be declining**  
A really bad scenario would be if a company keeps making less money year after year. Within a few years a low PE would turn into a high PE ( assuming the price is constant). This is not a scenario that you want and it would turn a cheap stock into a quite expensive stock

**There was a one off event**  
A one off Event is an event that occurs once and then it won’t repeat. Profits could’ve been higher last year because the Company sold an asset. It depends how they book it BUT it’s likely that it will distort the Price earnings ratio for that period. Even worse. If they sold parts of their company they will likely earn less money in the future. Once again this is not a scenario that you want!

**The Company could face expensive lawsuits**  
Another thing the PE doesn’t tell you is that the company might face huge fines in the near future. Did they put the money aside already ? If not it can hurt earnings

**The company could have declining Margins**  
Another thing the Price Earnings Ratio won’t tell you are if Margins are declining. This could be because of new competition etc. Once again a bad scenario that will turn a low PE into a high PE stock over some time

Can you think of other reasons why the PE could be misleading? I am looking forward to your comments._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good buying price for Square? Hey guys,

The home improvement retailer said Tuesday it will invest $1 billion in what it calls ‘incremental compensation’ annually for its workers. A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company’s average hourly wage will increase after the investment.

“It varies market by market. Our compensation, at all levels, is based on skills, responsibilities, performance and market rates,” the spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. [According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour. A sales associate earns $12 an hour, per Glassdoor.

The spokesperson said the “majority” of Home Depot’s 400,000 total employees will receive a pay bump from the new investment.

Other big box chains — sitting on big profits as consumers have stocked up on food and cleaning products amidst the pandemic — have also opened their wallets.

In July, [Target raised its starting wage for its store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-raises-minimum-wage-for-store-distribution-and-headquarter-employees-114504219.html), distribution and headquarter employees to $15 an hour. The move impacted 275,000 employees who work at the company’s stores and distribution centers. Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.

Walmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.

The world’s largest retailer’s pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.

“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said recently at the [Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit](https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit/).

I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are on long term PLTR plays given the current IV (100%+) and potential price volatility after the potential unloading of shares (Q1 lockup period). Currently, I have 200 shares purchased at \~$9 and I plan on increasing my positions over the next year.

Using 1/20/23 20c as an example, with IV being constant and a conservative $40 at expiration, you would gain 118% at expiration with the LEAPs vs 124% profit with the shares. 

I'm torn between LEAPs vs shares since premiums are quite expensive right now and the potential short term IV risk. If share price decreases, IV will also usually decrease (generally speaking) and the IV crush risk in Q1 due to unloading seems like a possibility. I also see IV potentially decreasing as time progresses since the IPO component will be less significant.

Obviously, the recent IPO status is a factor in the high overall IV and this IPO component may diminish as time progresses. These two IV risks lead me to think that LEAPs might not be the best long-term strategy right now but I would appreciate some different takes. Regardless if you think PLTR is a good long term investment, it would be beneficial to hear opinions on the potential IV risk factor and if it's worth taking this risk instead of buying shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
