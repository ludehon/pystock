Thanks to a catchy ticker, they shot up to \~$32 this week. This of course is retarded. As we all know, our lord and savior Elon Musk hates lidar, and I'm betting this fucker is primed to crater harder than Nikola.

Now when GMHI announced the deal, they were valuing Luminar at roughly $3.5 billion dollars, a bat shit crazy number for a company expecting to do $15 million in revenue this year, and $26 million the next. The market quite understandably knew this was a shit deal, and the stock sat pretty much at NAV forever. Yet today, that company pulling in a cool $15 million is "worth" over $10 billion.

Next take a look at Velodyne Lidar, a larger, significantly more established competitor who also briefly topped out at $32 a share, and is now hanging out at just over $15. They were only valued at $1.6 billion in their SPAC deal, and are expecting just over $100 million in revenue this year. 

If you need another reason to buy puts, the paint chip eating wizard of Wallstreet Jim Cramer thinks its a bargain at this price.

47,890,000 shares of SPCE have been sold short.

We are sitting at 89% of float sold short as of 15 November. What does this seemingly random number mean an autist like you? 

A price rise to $40 will absolutely penetrate short sellers and they will likely begin to cover the position thus driving prices up. SPCE could see $50 by EOY, just in time for this crazy simulation to be over.

The memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.

News like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:

IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.

They have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...

Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.

I don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.

They all will go up. This isn't one or the other._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next Major Position  

Well well well, its that time of year for me to write a DD post for the 50 odd people that will see it and the 2 people that will actually read this fuckin thing but here goes. Boomer stocks; especially AT&t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.

First: Potential Price Upgrade?

Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.

Second: Technicals:

I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.

This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.

Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).

Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

AMD's newly released Radeon 6000 Series GPUs appear to have filled the performance gap with NVDA's RTX  3000 series cards while also being slightly cheaper. 

Digital Foundry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM)

Ranked #4 for average benchmark on UserBenchmarks: [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/)

AMD seems like they have significantly improved their product line-up compared to the Radeon 5000 Series. AMD's value proposition for as a unified CPU and GPU manufacturer seems to have worked with last gen and current gen game consoles, as both Sony and Microsoft have opted for the same silicon. PC Users may also be attracted by the unified components value proposition and translate to higher PC CPU and GPU sales as AMD has filled the gap with both INTC and NVDA.

Depending on how many GPUs AMD keeps in stock and the actual demand for new GPUs in 2021, I think the 6000 Series could chip away at NVDA's strong lead in market share for GPUs like with Intel CPUs. In doing so, this may attract investors away from NVDA, like with INTC, and boost AMD's stock significantly.

IF (big if) AMD's next CPU/GPU line-up is to overtake NVDA next year, they could easily become the next $500B semi-conductor company in a few years.

Still time to join the tendie train before full-year update in February, but since you degenerates don't care about DD and would rather jerk off to someone else's money, here ya go._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Correlation between Emerging Markets Index (EEM) and US Dollar (DXY) is Setting Up a Good Trade So, I was pretty bullish on **SLV** and **GLD** because of long-term weakness in the dollar, but without stimulus, it looks like there isn’t going to be much more movement this year. Instead, I’ve been looking at the correlation between **EEM** and the **DXY** and see a lot of potential for a big trade to close out the year. 

Just for some background:

**EEM (Emerging Markets Index)**: Consists of a basket of companies that are incorporated outside the US in developing nations – think China, India, Brazil, etc...

It’s top ten holdings are:

[EEM Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/nx6mof8ad5361.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2cc1453f40d835a0beb1cd8ead750071f2fb06b)

**DXY (Dollar Index):** A dollar weighted index that derives its value by weighing six different currency pairs against the dollar (USDX and DXY are the same thing):

USDX = 50.14348112 × EURUSD -0.576 × USDJPY 0.136 × GBPUSD -0.119 × USDCAD 0.091 × USDSEK 0.042 × USDCHF 0.036

It doesn’t perfectly capture the value of the US dollar, but for the purposes of this post, it’s good enough. 

**Thesis:** Based on historical data there is a clear negative correlation between the **EEM** and the **DXY**. 

[EEM Index vs. DXY Price Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/o9fpbjskd5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=34caf74258c9bf0b61f1eb7505620fcfef6f3d52)

[30-Period Rolling Correlation of the Daily &#37; Change in Price of EEM vs. DXY](https://preview.redd.it/ykx2sf8od5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8a4cd2a42141f6afce4ac0b5a5e3588066862ff)

[30-Period Rolling Correlation of the Daily Price of EEM vs. DXY](https://preview.redd.it/lx2vo70wd5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e88b1e394bdcfab712dacf01eba1129af1b485)

Over the last \~15 years of price history, the correlation between the two indexes has been negative. There have been periods where the correlation reversed to the upside; however, those instances were rare and short-lived. Based on the data it's clear that the correlation is most negative succeeding the 2008 financial crisis with the introduction of QE and is sustained until 2012 when the **DXY** began to recover. There was also a short-lived negative correlation spike in 2016 (Donald Trump elected) and in 2018 (Trade War) - both the result of market volatility and a move out of equities and into USD. 

The **EEM** has never broken up above $55.00; however, given the massive headwind pushing the US dollar down, and the massive tailwind propelling nations like China, India, and others (or whatever), I'm willing to bet **EEM** breaks out above the $55.00 level in the next 3-6 months and pushes $60.00+ by the end of 2021.   

**Why:** A weaker dollar allows emerging market countries more freedom to provide fiscal stimulus without fearing negative implications for their own economies. For instance, an emerging market government might feel more comfortable with fiscal easing if its currency is rising, dampening the potential for an inflationary shock (there are other reasons, but I’m too lazy to list them all).

**Plan: EEM** is currently sitting at \~$50.80 as of this post, and the **DXY** is hovering around $0.9055. Based on some eyeballing “technical analysis”, it looks like the next level of support for the DXY is $0.8882. I’m also thinking that while stimulus might not happen this year, it’s basically guaranteed to happen in 2021. More stimulus should also help depress the US dollar. Also, the holidays are historically a good time for stocks and absent any (surprising) bad news, the market should melt up higher until Christmas. Lastly, the prices on EEM options are so cheap I’m fully erect even thinking about it.

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It’s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec’d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I’m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you’re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.

But you’re here to learn about Cinemark. And here’s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That’s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you’re a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where I’m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here’s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what you’re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I’ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it’s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it’s here I’ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So I’d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What’s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing I’d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you’ll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark’s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC’s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.
2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn’t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark’s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that’s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.
3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn’t really affected by this outcome.

Next, let’s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it’s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna’s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don’t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.
2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.
3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it’s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

Since the dip it has recovered to ~2.30. I believe in the next few weeks that this stock will not only make a huge recovery but next year I believe this stock will return to ATH. My reasoning behind this is that rolls royce makes a shitload of airline engines, obviously covid fucked traveling and hence maintenance and purchases of new jet engines. If you look at the 1 year chart you can see that this stock hasn't recovered at all since March and has been consistently dropping. I believe this company has been overlooked for so long because of the low share price and inability to trade options on them. This stock should make a steep recovery to the $5-$10 range in the coming year once travel has been brought back to normal levels. This isn't alot but think of it like this for every $2 you put in out comes $5 to $10, seems like a great trade right?

(I have not seen the actual proof yet)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HYAC - SPAC merger with Arko Holdings LTD - your next play HYAC is having the final merger meeting in 4 days, likely proceeded by ticker change around Thursday next week.

The last 2 SPAC mergers, QS on Nov.27, and LAZR since... Yesterday,  have popped in over ~150% gains in the week of the merger (including substantial dips). 

Arko Holdings LTD. is an Israeli-based company which owns over 3000 retail stores in USA over 20+ states, and looking for further business expansion next year.

My DD is based off their positive financials and revenue growth over COVID which leaves more hope for the future of brick&mortar stores, and they operate in convenience / groceries, which reminds me of $USFD (US Foods, spiking ~80% in the last 2 months), and a little of foreign companies like OZON (Russian e-commerce retailer similar to shop or amazon), gaining 20% in the last two weeks since IPO, due to foreigner companies doing US business/stock exchange.

Most importantly, last 2 SPAC mergers in QS and LAZR, are looking fire hot right now in their valuation increases, while both are in the EV bubble, Arko is already well established, and for a company about to merge at NAV, they are grossly undervalued. Arko Holdings trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at ~76 USD, while remaining at ~10 USD NAV on NASDAQ.

HYAC + Arko SPAC will likely pop in the coming days, get it in while you can.

TLDR: New SPAC merger between HYAC and ARKO HOLDINGS sitting at NAV($10), very high upsides due to people on the EV train/bubble and not looking at other companies with established financials and growth - recent mergers in QS and LAZR indicate potential pops with low downsides. Get in while you can 🚀🚀🚀

On one hand, there are the retards, and on the other hand there are the autists. Mind you, both retards and autists can gain money, and both retards and autists can lose money. The difference lies in how they do it. 

The retards are the public face of WSB and its most vocal cohort. Mind you, I'm not looking down on retards. I've made plenty of trades that can properly be described as "retarted" rather than autistic, like YOLOING my whole account on SPY puts and UXVY shares before the election. 

I've also learned quite a bit from the retards of this sub. The most important lesson has been not to be too uptight about money. After I blew up 70% of my account, my brain was telling me to get the hell out of the casino, but you all gave me the inspiration to pick up the pieces and YOLO them again. I've since recovered more than half of my Robinhood "tuition." 

But WSB's retards have also taught me what not to do. After NIO and PLTR rose precipitously most of November, many of you bought weeklies, and many of your portfolios (and the portfolios of your suggestible family members, coworkers, and friends) were decimated. It seems that buying calls at the peak of a long green run without any coherent thesis as to why the stock is still undervalued is not the way. "Retard strength" can move microcaps, but it can't move stocks with a float of more than a billion shares. Therein lies the difference between the retards and autists of WSB. 

The autists of WSB form their thesis before the run and before the retards have piled into their echo chamber. They might be early, but they are never late. There are a lot of super smart people on this sub, offering top-notch DD, but their voices are not always heard. Sometimes the memes come to life, and there's no longer any need to approach them rationally, but TSLA is the exception, not the norm. We've all been spoiled by the brilliance of its meme power, but that light can no longer lead us to Valhalla. We need to be smart, and put our faith in the true autists. 

There will always be the FDs that go up 5000% and the AAs that go up 600% when we meant to buy calls on AAL, but the law of averages dictates that the retards will lose. I may be a retard, and I have certainly lost, but I'm trying to turn it around.

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.

The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.

Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. 

The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.

While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.

Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million

Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.

Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.

This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA

[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.

While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.

A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. 

While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. 

Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.

And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave & Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

CAT scan = Computerised Axial Tomography. Older scanners needed to do one ‘slice’ every 2 or 3 millimetres. Very slow. Large radiation dose. Largely phased out. Newer machines are ‘helical‘ scanners. Take pictures in a spiral, not slices. Much faster, much less radiation.

Current CAT scanners have software to enable 3D reconstruction of solid objects: like bones. The reconstructed image can then be rotated so you can ‘see’ what it looks like in 3D. As you can imagine, this ability is crucial in several medical / surgical specialties.

It is not clear if NNOX scans can do this. The presentation yesterday was not clear on this point. The scans are described as ‘tomograms’ which means slices, but not clear if 3D reconstruction possible AND THIS MATTERS.

The total radiation dose for a NNOX scan also matters, although unlikely an issue.

Have written to them. Bombard them with the question: does NNOX scan allow 3D reconstruction?

Edit: broke the golden rule: 127.78 shares at 57.8. There is another potential problem: NNOX business case is ‘pay per play’ I.e. pay per X-ray or scan, rather than outright sale of equipment. This is open to accusations of profiteering IF the costs are seen to be exploitative. They also make a HUGE claim that X-rays or scans will be interpreted by AI assisted by remote radiologists. Established radiologists are not going to like this one bit.

* ZUO is a SaaS company like PLTR and enables subscription commerce for companies who want to transition their businesses from traditional one time transactions to Netflix-like recurring subscriptions.
* Recurring subscription are valued much higher by boomer shareholders (# PLTR), making ZUO an attractive play for every major company on the planet
* ZUO already transact $12B+ of annual subscriptions with massive growth rates
* Unlike PLTR, ZUO has been trading sideways since IPO two years ago and is currently near all time lows. Absolute bargain and can only go up from here! Very cheaply valued compared to nearly all other SaaS companies.

* **Just released an earnings and forecast beat, sending shares up 5.7% premarket. Closed biggest deal in history this quarter. Will keep beating earnings from here according to industry trend.**
* ZUO benefits from the global digitisation trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic and is expected to further take-off in 2021.

Some.background: I am a software engineer. I don't work at Palantir. This is all based on my own prior knowledge and things I have read in one of their user guides.

Here it goes.

Pretend I'm the NSA. I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.

Palantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.

1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the "universe" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.

2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.

The end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cel-Sci's Multikine I made a DD post about this ticker the other day and it got taken down because of market cap.

1. Binary Lotto play, buying a call aint gonna make u money unless its good news.
2. 213 Days since Trial ended, waiting on FULL results to come out (final event announcement was May 4th, 2020)
3. CEO Bullish comments on twitter. Hinting at all data having been collected during the lock-up period.
4. Range $10-15, Expecting $30\~ on positive news, $2.50 if negative.
5. My position $17.50c 12.18.20, will roll the dice a couple more times if news isn't out by then, always gonna have calls on this til my RH account is $0, or until the news comes out.
6. Immunotherapy is Huge and growing, if positive news comes out, i expect offers after FDA approval
7. Cancer is a dick, short it

If it dies on no news I'll roll the dice a couple more times til February, Geerts tweets got me into the position. Been watching this since May, sitting on the sidelines waiting for some kind of signal, I believe this is it.

# Intel Advances Progress in Integrated Photonics for Data Centers

 **About the New Technology Building Blocks:** At the Intel Labs virtual event today, Intel demonstrated key progress in critical technology building blocks that are fundamental to the company’s integrated photonics research. These technology building blocks — including light generation, amplification, detection, modulation, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) interface circuits and package integration — are essential to achieve integrated photonics. A prototype shown at the event featured tight coupling of photonics and CMOS technologies, serving as a proof-of-concept of future full integration of optical photonics with core compute silicon. Intel also showcased micro-ring modulators that are 1000x smaller than traditional components. The large size and cost of conventional silicon modulators have been a barrier to bringing optical technology onto server packages, which require the integration of hundreds of these devices. These combined results pave the way for the extended use of silicon photonics beyond the upper layers of the network to inside the server and onto future server packages. 

Intel technology building blocks showcased:

* **Micro-ring modulators:** Conventional silicon modulators take up too much area and are costly to place on IC packages. By developing micro-ring modulators, Intel has miniaturized the modulator by a factor of more than 1,000, thereby eliminating a key barrier to integrating silicon photonics onto a compute package.
* **All-silicon photodetector:** For decades, the industry has believed silicon has virtually no light detection capability in the 1.3-1.6um wavelength range. Intel showcased research that proves otherwise. Lower cost is one of the main benefits of this breakthrough.
* **Integrated semiconductor optical amplifier:** As the focus turns to reducing total power consumption, integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers are an indispensable technology, made possible with the same material used for the integrated laser.
* **Integrated multi-wavelength lasers:** Using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing, separate wavelengths can be used from the same laser to convey more data in the same beam of light. This enables additional data to be transmitted over a single fiber, increasing bandwidth density.
* **Integration:** By tightly integrating silicon photonics and CMOS silicon through advanced packaging techniques, we can gain three benefits: lower power, higher bandwidth and reduced pin count. Intel is the only company that has demonstrated integrated multi-wavelength lasers and semiconductor optical amplifiers, all-silicon photodetectors, and micro-ring modulators on a single technology platform tightly integrated with CMOS silicon. This research breakthrough paves the path for scaling integrated photonics.

Position IBKR:  50 stonks (yes, we buy stonks here like big bois)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airbnb - the Dean thinks proposed IPO valuation is fair **What we know:**

Airbnb intends to IPO at a price of $44-50 per share. At the $50 mark, that's a equity valuation of $35 billion. 

**Who TF is the Dean and why should we listen to what he says?**

His name is Aswath Damodaran who is finance professor at NYU and teaches corporate valuation among other things. Sometimes interviewed on CNBC to balance out the crazies. He always says he doesn't aim to time the market, but he did buy TSLA pretty much at the very bottom at $180 some time ago (I always regret not following his trade), although he did sell a bit later around the $600 mark (pre-split).

**Ok, tell me what he valued Airbnb at:**

About $36 billion or $54.41 per share (he takes into account options, warrants, RSUs etc)

**TL:DR**

Buying Airbnb at $54 is a fair price from a valuation perspective. The further below, the better the buy.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Indices VS Bears in the 2020 Stock Market _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: OK degenerates. Here's a quick heads up about tomorrow. The merger between $HCCH and Fusion Fuel is happening. Fusion Fuel is a green hydrogen company, who makes hydrogen tendies and is getting ready to launch the rocket to tendie town. Read on if you slept on last 2 SPACs mergers that mooned. TL;DR below.

$HCCH (HL Acquisitions Corp) slipped under my radar, but I am thinking it's about to bust open like the Kensington and Quantum Space merger $QS.

If  you didn't see that colossal 80% rise in 1.5 days a few days ago. Then  go peak how hard and fast that green rocket shot up. This time we got a  green hydrogen rocket being gased up by Fusion Fuel and it's taken us to green tendy town. Green  hydrogen batteries and green hydrogen products are riding the ev market,  the green energy market, tech market and this company has got it's fingers in globally and a big sister company who is facilitating growth. This SPAC is already

(For the noobs: This is a SPAC merger, SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are companies that investors and retail investors buy so that they can merge with a company and give them a large injection of cash and bring that company public. After merger all the stocks and warrants in the SPAC get transferred to the new company and that companies ticker replaces the SPACs. Most SPACs also have a legal guarntee that every share you buy is backed up to 10$ in the event that the merger doesn't go through. )

&#x200B;

Here is some DD from someone who actually likes reading the investor presentations.

&#x200B;

"Anyone holding HCCH has probably seen [their investor presentation](https://hlacquisitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HL_FF-Investor-Presentation_6.23.20.pdf) by now.

What struck me throughout the presentation was the mention of MagP Inovação being an *exclusive partner* and their CPV solar trackers being exclusive to Fusion Fuel. What I haven't seen discussed on reddit yet is that [MagP Inovação and Fusion Fuel are owned by the same private company](https://keyfh.com/), KFH Investments.

The investor presentation states that "MagP has **constructed**   and installed 20+ solar plants around the world, performing daily   tracker performance monitoring with 98% up-time over the past 10-years".   A different section states that "Fusion Fuel’s electrolyzer can attach   to CPV modules **already being produced**   by MagP Inovação". Suddenly, it makes sense why Fusion Fuel's   electrolyzers are being built to specifically work with MagP's CPV   trackers. Clearly, there is some manufacturing expertise in place that   Fusion Fuel will benefit from when it comes time to build the   electrolyzers.

I also haven't seen  solar  irradiation levels discussed in the previous DDs, which are  paramount  to HCCH's play. Portugal and Spain have [the highest levels in Western Europe](https://i.imgur.com/7OsdREP.png). [Here is a detailed look at Portugal specifically](https://i.imgur.com/ZH8drpE.png). This is probably a huge stretch, but KFH also [own a 39 hectate winery](https://medeiroswines.com/en) in the [Moura region](https://i.imgur.com/wCon6rU.png),   which has near peak levels of normal irradiation in Portugal. Again,   probably a huge stretch and I have no idea what the price of land is in   Portugal, I just found this interesting from a synergy standpoint.

The Portugese government [plans to invest USD 7.3B in green hydrogen projects by 2030](https://renewablesnow.com/news/portuguese-govt-approves-national-hydrogen-policy-699832/).   That is great and all IMO, but "New market development (e.g., North   America, MENA, Australia)" being the first thing listed in the investor   presentation timeline (with a timeline of 0-1 years) is what attracted   me. Nikola [paid Nel ASA $30M](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-orders-enough-electrolysis-equipment-from-nel-to-produce-40000-kgs-of-hydrogen-per-day-79)   this month for enough electrolyzers to power 5 of their planned  fueling  stations @ 8k kg/day. The last 3 slides of Fusion Fuel's  presentation  make some extremely bold claims about the CapEx costs of  their tech vs.  centralized electrylyzers. They claim \~$196 USD/kW vs.  \~$1,064 USD/Kw  for centralized electrolyzers. This is why I'm so  bullish right now."

While US Steel will get its gains, I think an even better opportunity lies with Cleveland Cliffs (CLF).  Cleveland Cliffs is a company that previously specialized in making iron ore pellets.  In the past decade, they have had a market cap in excess of $14B, vs a market cap now of just under $5B.  However, they have recently been on a buying spree.  Cleveland Cliffs acquired AK Steel Holding Corporation in Mar-2020, a company operating 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants.  AK Steel is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products.  They are also in the process of acquiring ArcelorMittal USA later in Q4 2020.  What does that give us?  A vertically integrated supply chain, baby!
 
As you can see in their 10Q, they’ve nearly tripled their revenue on a quarterly basis over the last year.  The one down side is their net income was fairly low due to high COGS.  This is where the vertically integrated supply chain comes in.  They will be able to take it from the mines to pellets to flat rolled steel and keep all those sweet profits to themselves.  The net margin has trended fairly well over time, with the exception of an odd year or two here and there (2014-2016... ouch!, and 2020).  It has always bounced back though to the 15-20% range.  Add to that the backdrop of steel prices rising ~17% in the last two months, and you have some very profitable quarters incoming.  Additionally, their current ratio is very good, so despite making acquisitions, they have maintained a rock-solid balance sheet, pun intended.  I think this could run up to low 30’s.  Look at what the steel industry does: overreacts to supply and demand.  I can smell the tendies already.

&#x200B;

Welcome to today's History & Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, " Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?"

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

Since **mid-November**—and right after RC sent his soon to be legendary letter to the Board—GameStop posted some mighty interesting job announcements for its Grapevine HQs. Especially for a Dying-Brick-and-Mortar-90s-Mall-Bro-Boomer company. 

It definitely seems like this Blockbuster redux is TOTALLY uninterested in pivoting to e-commerce, digital monetization, and a technologically-driven marketing infrastructure and product distribution landscape. 

Just find ‘em in the mall.

Or else you bears are just fucking stupid and cant read or understand words good.

But you don’t have to take my word for it. Do the clickity clickity and the read-y read-y. 

I think you’ll find it just as odd as I do that a soon-to-be-bankrupt boomer company just published a bunch of silicon-valley-jargon-filled-digital-monetization-bla bla jobs right before everyone is wondering if they’re going to pivot away from being Another Cautionary Tale and toward a Fuck Yeah E-commerce-centric Money Minting Technology-driven Gaming Company You’re Gonna Tell Your Goddamn Grandkids About When You’re Old and Rich (and hopefully fulfilled spiritually and emotionally after many kind and generous years of philanthropy and a lot of self-care and reflection)

Pelosi and McConnell sit facing each other at the long, wide and black conference table, not speaking yet discussing with their eyes. A bunch of important-looking people in white shirts and charcoal suits line like bowling pins along the shiny surface of the table, rambling feverishly about pointless details of the upcoming deadline.

Pelosi - a little bored and bothered with the whole process - slips off her shiny, black heels underneath the grand table. She stretches - her back an arch, slender legs elegantly crossed, firmly pressed along the tight pantyhose of her thighs. None of the bowling pins turned to notice.

Suddenly, the corners of her blush-red lips curl into a sly smile. Her supple leg, like the flexible neck of a black swan, slowly extends into the darkness under the desk, unseen beneath the babbling nonsense of the talking heads around her.

Nudge. Her toes curl on McConnell's inner thigh. The lace of her pantyhose wrinkle against the smooth silk of McConnell's pants.

It was as if lightning jolted through McConnell's entire body, almost snapping his neck to look down at what intruded his sacred space.

First, a wave of confusion.

Then, realization hit.

He looks up, all of a sudden noticing the beautiful woman across the black ocean and pointless chatter. She was two armspans away, but to him he felt he could touch her. She was eighty years old, but to him she glowed like an immortal goddess. She was a Democrat, but to him that didn't matter anymore.

She then winked and did the blowie motion with her tongue in cheek.

Ten seconds of unspeakable thoughts flashed through his head and his tie felt too tight. Then, he shook his head, hard.

"No." McConnell shuffled his chair backwards, no longer in reach of the swan under the desk.

“We just don’t have time to waste time.”

And what I found was that this bull run has A LOT of gas left in the tank.

If you are not aware yet CAPE stands for cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio.

https://imgur.com/gallery/c4xo5iv

Now, taking a closer look at the chart you can see this ratio rally up during the roaring 20’s and then again even higher around the new millennium.  As we approach 2021 the ratio is approaching the height of the latter.

Why is this important?  If you draw a trend line across the two peaks you can see that the CAPE ratio and current rally still has a ton of upside left in it.

If someone can explain this better it seems that because of their redemption period they have to maintain a share price above $18 or forfeit being able to redeem their warrants at a price of $.01.

If it opens under $360 tomorrow (Friday) I’ll eat my bird on livestream _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Jumia: This Nigerian prince has grown up, but has not changed We have shorted Jumia several times with a perfect track record. This week we opened a new short position, which we believe will be more profitable that all our previous trades. The best way we can describe Jumia is an investment vehicle to swindle investors out of their money. Jumia at its core remains the same company that IPOed in 2019. Then there was a lot of concern about honesty of the management team--that concern remains. Investors who understand the proverb, “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me”, would avoid investing in this highflying Nigerian company.

Jumia’s stock is running high due to an increase in demand that has already fizzled out. The company has no path to profitability. The demand for Jumia’s goods in the second and third quarter was not organic; it was mostly driven by store closures, supply problems, and an imitation of Western countries. Our research shows that Coronavirus fears in Africa were prevalent from mid-February to mid-August. After that period, people mostly stopped caring about Covid-19 and returned to their normal shopping habits. Jumia experienced an increase in demand from mid-April to mid-August. Hence, it was able to capitalize on Covid-19 fear by reducing advertisement expenses by 55%. The lag in start of expected increase in demand was mostly due to poor experience of ordering goods from Jumia. High rates of cancellations, failed deliveries and returns were a testament to that fact. High advertising budget is an essential and necessary part of Jumia’s business model. The profits Jumia can derive from each customer was and will never be more than the cost of customer acquisition. 

Revenue in the third quarter dropped despite onboarding more customers. During the golden time of e-commerce, total revenue dropped from $40.9 to $33.7 million. First party revenue (i.e. revenue from merchandise bought and sold by Jumia) dropped by 53% year on year in the third quarter. This pattern is in line with continuous reduction in in FPR reported in the previous quarters.

Jumia management executed a perfect share offering worth $243.2 million at an average price of $30.51. We see that as the management’s agreement with our thesis that shares prices are significantly inflated. We were able to initiate our short position at a slightly higher price.  

Two catalysts will burst this bubble: The next earnings report showing significant underperformance during the holiday season. We believe Jumia’s 2020 black-Friday and cyber-Monday sales were significantly lower than those of 2019. The second catalyst will be American investors rotating out of Covid-related stocks when a vaccine is approved in the United States.

To address a recent endorsement presentation by Citron Research about Jumia: we were able to read between the lines and decipher motivation of presenter. Hence, we are thankful to Citron Research making opening price of our short more attractive.

**VIRGIN GROUP'S ACQUISITION CORP**

This is my boy *Richard Branson's* SPAC and he is actively trying to get in on the EV hype. If this ticker turns out anything like his other love child, SPCE, we can pretty much count on a one-way trip to the moon. He's been on the EV hype train for quite a while and the current EV goldrush seems to have created the perfect storm. His SPAC had an initial public offering of $480,000,000.

"Virgin boss Richard Branson is about to go head-to-head with Tesla’s Elon Musk by adding an electric vehicle to the brand’s already extensive portfolio.

During an interview with Bloomberg TV, Branson said that he has a team working on developing an electric vehicle for the mass market, which would rival Tesla. This statement was released during the Formula E event in Miami. The billionaire said that Virgin might compete with Tesla in the electric car business in the future.

Virgin has already developed an electric car, which is currently competing in the electric version of the world's premiere racing competition Formula 1. Formula E uses a more defined and well-engineered electric motor similar to its counterparts in Formula 1."

Now we all know the key to SPACs is to get in on the ground floor. Why? Because minimal risk, that's why. This SPAC is currently trading at the bargain price of 10.40 thanks to that lovely little market crash we had over the last couple of days.

Speculation on speculation. The most prominent rumor floating around the SPACiverse is that they will be working with the company Envision.

I'm a little retarded so I have no idea if this SPAC has already been talked about on WSB, but it's only just getting picked up by the Youtube stock influencers. My game plan is to get in "early" before *all* the influencers pick it up.

If anything, this is a great ticker to park some cash while we wait for news. The headline "Branson is about to go head-to-head with Tesla's Elon Musk" should be enough to make this move. It's just a matter of when.

Boy has it been an ugly 7 day bloodbath for BestBuy. The kind of red river flow that makes you second guess taking the dirt road home. But man have I been waiting for this moment.

*Currently $106.50 a share*

The answer is simple: buy, and buy fast.. and here is why:

1. Their Q3 sales were knock out. 22% increase from Q3’19 and 173.7% increase in online orders.

2. Their dividend was just increased to .55cents per share. (must own stock before 12/14. Dividend payout is early January.

3. JPMorgan just upped their price target from $115 to $124.

4. Their 3 month RSI is extremely low. Hovering around 31..the company is ridiculously oversold right now. 

5. Their market cap is $28B and they do $40B in revenue each year. TDAmeritrade has them marked extremely low with a P/E ratio of 15

6. The Holliday season is here and electronics are the new sliced bread. Within the next two weeks I can realistically see it running $8-10 higher.

7. I’m not sure about you, but the BestBuy where I live (Connecticut) is consistently packed. Good products, inventory and an established brand.

But I’ll leave it at that for now. Keeping the list at a lucky 7 in hopes for a Jackpot. Check out the chart and further your DD if this post sparked any curiosity. 

(Keep in mind I am extremely bias, for as I have my balls on the line with this. And 55 calls that expire in January.. So a decently high risk.. On a scale of “doesn’t make a difference if they expire - to - I’ll be hanging in the rafters” I’m probably like a “will be slightly depressed for a day or two, and gaze out the window with a melancholic stare while listening to All You Wanted by Michelle Branch.”

4. Short interest currently at 137%, meaning people shorted many more stocks than there are actual stocks to buy back. This number, 137%, is very significant and unheard of. Meaning when the stocks keep rising, all those who shorted the stock have to fight that much harder to buy shares back to cover their shorts, leading to a short squeeze. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

&#x200B;

5. No, the short squeeze isn't "over". If you look at the volume of shares shorted, it's literally increasing. If the shorts are covering their position, you'd see a lower volume of shares shorted. Why are they shorting more instead of just buying back? They short to drive prices down to cause people to panic and sell, which drives prices more down, so they can cover their short position and buy back cheap shares from all the paper hand retail investors. They have confidence we will fold and sell, and judging from all the paper hands selling PLTR from just a single Citron report, maybe they're right.

And you can bet there are whale longs out there trying to start this squeeze as well. We're just shrimp for the ride, as another autist had said in a comment somewhere else.

TL;DR = just another GME mooning post, but hopefully explained in a more noob way, cuz im noob  
TLDRTLDR =   🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀



Bonus edit: maybe some of you are wondering how to play the short squeeze. I spent a whole five minutes researching, and found out there's this thing called "days to cover", which is some number that's calculated by smart people, and it tells you the average number of days in order for all the shorts to be able to cover their position. Last time I checked the days to cover for gme is like 5.7 ish, which means the shorts will need to spend at least 5.7 days of buying stocks in order to buy back enough to cover their shorts, based on current average stock movement volume. 

What does this mean? It means the prices will be going up for days before the peak. Meaning if you sell within the first day of the squeeze, you'll regret it, but also your sale will contribute to stunting the growth of the mooning stock peen, so shame on you for selling within the first day. Hold for a couple of days and see triple digits hopefully.

And no, I was lying that I had 4 shares. I actually have 20, bought at $19, the most autistic entry point possible because I'm an expert. The 4 is symbolic of how fucking poor I am._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The real way GME could go interstellar overnight: Dividends Many people are excited for a potential squeeze caused by the $100M authorized in share buybacks. I think this is the wrong strategy. For those of you who may not know, when there is a dividend on a stock sold short, the short seller must pay it to the person they're borrowing from.

If management declares a dividend policy targeting 50% of future FCF, I believe GME stock would quickly appreciate to its Fair Market Value (FMV) on a DCF valuation model. If management also lays out a plan for the long term evolution of the company, that valuation model would rise significantly. But the dividend is what would convince the market of the fair value of GME shares.

They know there price will tank as these sell off, they have to sell them as quickly as possible. This will push share prices down to the $2 level within the next two weeks. No investor wants this to happen to a company.

\[b\]Now wait, doesn't this just mean that the company will be bigger and more profitable?\[/b\]

No - A normal stock issue isn't that detrimental to a company, they issue stock, get more money, and use that money to improve the company. But in this case they are spending this money at a burn rate of [200M+ a Month](https://deadline.com/2020/10/amc-entertainment-3q-sales-at-119m-had-419m-in-cash-as-of-sept-30-plans-to-sell-more-stock-to-raise-cash-1234600263/)

They will raise 100M - 500M off of this stock sale, and burn through it in less then 3 months, being no better off then they were three months previous, no better product, same old theaters, nothing will change, but they will have spent all the money they raised paying debtors, rent, employees, utils.

\[b\]But isn't the bottom already here? They lost 16% today\[/b\]

I don't believe they have been able to sell many shares yet. It will take them a couple weeks to sell that many shares. Plus they have had other bad news today.

Warner Bros. says [Movie Theaters be Fucked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/business/media/warner-brothers-movies-release-streaming.html)

\[b\]They have 6B in Debt\[/b\], they obviously can't get any more loans, otherwise they never would have issues a 200M shares. At their expected burn rate the last three months they must be almost out of cash.

Their expenses, loan payments, and rent payments are way to high to continue for 6 months of almost non existent movie attendance.

**Isn't moviegoing attendance turning around? - No.**

[Weekend movie sales are hovering around 11M](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_secondarytab) This is down from an average of 220M.

AMC holds about 72% of the market share, they get to keep about [50% of ticket sales](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/b23298d4-61c9-4028-9103-b652338c303f.html#AMC-20191231X10K_HTM_ITEM6SELECTEDFINANCIALDATA_712989), and concession sales top out at 50% of ticket sales, this gives them monthly income of $35M and they have 80% of their theaters open to get that much income, they have to pay utilities and employees at about 800 theaters in order to get that 45 Million.

Last year they had 40k employees (mostly part time) Even if they only need 1/3 of that number, at $14 an hour, at 30 hours a week average, that comes to 25M a month. Rent is 80M / Month, interest is at least $25M / Month

Even with the best possible cost cutting, even if their loans become interest free for a year, they will lose 150M a month until attendance is at 2019 levels.

\[b\]But won't the debtors renegotiate? Give them more loans?\[/b\]

Here is the rub. They have assets to cover a good portion of their debt. They have 2.7B in property. They also have 4.7B in lease right of use. This will cover a good portion of their debt. Debtors may be thinking that it is better to rip off the Band-Aid now, and resell the theaters and property, then to have them depreciate another year and have assets sold off to pay the rent at a 200M+ burn rate.

\[b\]They are poised for a bankruptcy, and this stock sale proves it.\[/b\]

We have seen another company slowly die through stock dilution sales in the movie sector- **MOVIEPASS.**

You might be asking: How does this help me - Buy Puts, sell calls, short shares, exit upward positions. All investors will be looking to escape this loser.

AMC said it may sell the shares from time to time, in one or more series or issuances, and on terms that will be determined at the time of the offering. The company said it had 85.6 million Class A shares and 51.8 million Class B shares outstanding as of Oct. 30. The stock has dropped 34.6% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.06% has gained 6.2%.

Edit:

**Someone will just buy em, right?**

They were perfect for a buyout before issuing 200M shares (besides the 5.5B Debt), but no company will buy something so diluted until the price plummets to 1/3 of what it was.

It would cost a company 2 -3x what they would have spent last week to buy the same % of the company at current share prices.
