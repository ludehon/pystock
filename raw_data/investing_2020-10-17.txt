Mobile home parks VS. Multifamily syndications? I'm evaluating a lot of private offerings either deal by deal or fund models and I've recently been seeing some attractive looking returns in the mobile home park space. The concept of tenant owned homes having low turnover, less capex/payroll/insurance burden, makes this space especially attractive. It seems like multifamily deals are getting tighter and tighter, while the MHP space still seems to offer some quality returns.. thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mentorship Hi, does anyone know how I can contact a successfull investor to teach a beginner useful stuff for free possibly?

I am 17 years old and startet reading books.
I have big dreams and decided to give investing a go. I don’t really understand how all of it works and connections, who own who and how I can open a bank account to invest.
I think a person could explain this better and teach me how to begin is all I am asking._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Saw this article on what a "Low Cost" index fund is. How low does the cost have to be for you to define it as low cost?? Just wondering what you would define as low cost? Obviously anything with a high cost such as 1% has to be able to produce a return which is sufficient for that cost. But with the S&P beating pretty much all the funds recently with a low cost, is there really much point paying a high percentage to fund managers??

Okay the thing is is that these weed companies that I've been seeing are just disgusting okay they don't have the money they don't have the financial power they don't have any resources barely any okay to make themselves really grab the ball that even goes to they're drinking side of things in edibles.

I live in Canada so the entrepreneurship is completely dead because it's like a communist country any type of society that fixates on socialism and taxing is pretty much communistic and destroys entrepreneurship because the more you work the less you get paid that's how it goes it sucks I actually I'm planning to move to America someday I'm a right-wing add person I can't stand this left-sided world but that's a different topic altogether so I won't bother indulging any further

By the way I'm using speech to text so there won't be any periods or commas a little too lazy to do such.

If the USA legalized federally weed and all the states were all greenlet to go I could see baking companies in baking Goods like manufacturers that sell brownie patters and other things of sorts would dabble into edible weed products while the liquor company would dabble into the weed booze Market no alcohol just pure THC and whatever the other chemical is called. And for the tobacco company I get to see them dominating the smoking part aspects of stuff. You have your joints 10 pack of joints for $10 okay that's the average going price for cigarettes Plus the companies have the financial power and capability of doing these things.

Furthermore let's face it no one likes a hangover no one likes to barf while at a party and with weed edibles and beverages like Bacardi rum but we'd infused and no alcohol yes, it would be awesome. Because let's face it you're at a party do you really want to be sick and make a look like a fool out yourself not really show drinking a Bacardi rum that has weed and it would be awesome no headache or feel nauseous.

I don't know what do you guys think you think that some food company and liquor company as well as say Tobacco Company would dominate the weed Market. I don't see why not. Question that remains is will it ever become legalized for entrepreneurship or will it be controlled by the government. At the end of the day. And if so what company would actually take up the mantle Mass producing such stuff.

On just asking is do you think it would be even possible for there such a thing to happen if it does I could definitely see the thoughts for such companies going through the roof.

Oh also when Facebook release the ocular Rift attacks the account thing there's already been Bans and now people have $400 devices that are paperweight trash. The pandering companies like Sony Disney Netflix they're not worth March value in the stock at all they should only be worth like $0.06 a share to be honest. Also the Canadian government wants to tax Netflix big time and any type of streaming services yeah just because they're making so much money during this epidemic it's just a bunch of nonsense.

Honestly the commonwealth countries just suck I'm planning to move to the states just because there's better prospects Shield.

Oh yeah I know I went completely off topic with the other half of this but my question Still Remains do you think that tobacco companies with really dabble into weed if they could including the booze at what companies would actually take it into consideration_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking to bounce some ideas off folks Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing and quite young, and after a fair amount of research, I would love to hear your thoughts on a few stocks I've been eyeing for my portfolio. I am looking to create a portfolio that I won't touch for at least 5 years (besides the last stock I list here, which looks intriguing). I plan to invest a relatively small amount (only three to five thousand) as I am only 20, and that is already the lion share of my funds. So without further ado:

T ----- bought a good chunk of shares (\~34) when it was at its lowest during the pandemic. The dividend plus potential from 5G looked especially interesting to me. I'm pretty comfortable holding on to it, especially at the price I got it, but I am curious as to what you think of AT & T's potential for the next 5 years. 

NKE ----- Seems like Nike is really taking control over their products and brand name, closing a bunch of high profile accounts with 3rd party vendors. This new strategy seems interesting and I think it is particularly telling that many experts (i.e. Barrons) almost unanimously list it as a buy even though the stock went up $10 dollars a share this week alone. 

ABBV ---- Seems like a solid stock with a fair amount of potential products coming out in 2021. Plus, they have a hefty dividend (they're a dividend aristocrat) and have the best selling drug in the world, Humira.

NVDA ----- Incredibly solid company with ridiculous annual growth over the past few years.  Regardless of whether the ARMS acquisition happens, it seems like a real champion in a very lucrative field (semiconductors).

MSGE ---- this one is purely speculative. It seems like New York City is shutting down again, which I imagine will be detrimental to MSGE (which owns Madison Square Garden and other entertainment complexes). If played right seems like it could be bought for a bargain with potentially very high rewards by even the summertime or next year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Another post about Arkk Hi!

I would like to ask this community on how to properly analyse the following stock: CBIO. According to this [article](https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/raymond-james-says-these-3-stocks-could-surge-over-100-from-current-levels/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Raymond+James+Says+These+3+Stocks+Could+Surge+Over+100++From+Current+Levels&utm_campaign=story_thu), the analyst claims the stock will have a gain of 303% within 12 months and reach a price of almost $20/share. If this text is too long for, go ahead and just read the conclusion + question.

Catalyst Bioscience Inc. is pharmaceutical company that as of date has no profit. They have however, a few 'promising products'. Some basic background information first:

1. Hemophilia is a blood disorder. It is characterised by a deficiiency of factor VIII (type A) or factor IX (type B). These factors play an important role in the coagulation cascade. In simpeler words, if patiënts are born with this deficiëncy, they will have problem with forming clot and therefore a higher chance of bleeding episodes, for example bleeding in muscles, joint, nosebleeds etc. The patiënts with a severe form of this disease, have to go to the hospital every week and get an intravenous injection of these factors. This is called profylactic treatment. Intravenous injection is expensive, invasive and inconvienient. They also have to go to the hospital if they have a severe bleeding episode, to stop the bleeding they also receive these factors, called on demand treatment of bleeding episodes.
2. It is possible to divide the immunesystem in two type: the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system. There are certain proteines, called complement, which play an important role in both systems. They make sure that certain cells, such as T-cels, migrate to the correct location, for example a site of infection. They also make it possible for macrophages to recognices bacteria and viruses, so that phagocytosis can take place (killing of bactera/virus). One example of such a complement is called C3 (this one plays a pivitol role). There are several diseases in which the complement is overactive and causes problems for the patients. By inhibiting this C3 complement, you could treat those diseases. Examples are: dry AMD (macular degeneration), aHUS, PNH, complement-3 glomerulopathy, neurologic diseases such as myasthenia graves, but really any auto-immuun disease could be affectd through this inhibition.

This company has developed four main products:

1. MarzAA, which is factor VIIa, injected subcutaneously (under the skin) instead of intraveneous (directly in the veins). It has entered a phase 3 clinical trial in late 2020. It compares MarzAA with 60 patients with hemophilia A or B with bleeding episodes with standard patiënt care. If this trial is succesful, it will most likely result in the approval of the FDA of this product, generating revenu in the short term. There are also phase 1/2 trials for factor VII deficiency, glanzmann thrombasthenia and patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors treated with helimbra for treatment of bleeding episodes starting in the late 2020. **In others words, in the future, it will probably be used for more than just bleeding episodes of hemophilia A/B.**
2. Dalca, which is factor IX. A phase 2 trial has been completed for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia B. A phase 3 trial is underway in late 2020. So they will soon also produce revenu on the basis of this product. But soon could also mean a couple of years. 
3. An anti-complement factor 3. On oktober the 14th they announced that they have a patent for this product which will last untill 2038. They are currently busy with pre-clinical trials on mouse, to see if it has an effect on dry AMD. The stock price went up from $4.80 to $6.40 on the day of announcement.
4. Fix-gene therapie of factor IX. There are trials on mice; seems in-vitro to be 3-4x better than the Padua variant (Pfizer/Stark).

Everything seems nice and well for this company, however there are a few problems, mainly competition. According to their 10k-report:

1. MarzAA's competitive advatange is the subcutaneous (SQ) injection. Novo nordisk and Pfizer are developing their own SQ variants of tissue pathway inhibitors. They are currently also conducting phase 3 clinical trials! Expected to finish in 2023. There is also another trial by Genenzyme, phase 3 clinical trial, for RNA-interference therapeutic targeting of antitrombin therapie. OPKO Health factor VIIA SQ has entered phase-1 trial. Novo Nordisk FVIII SQ entered phase 2 study. **If you ask me their competitive advantage may very well be nullified as soon as their product is approved or very shortly afterward.** 
2. There are already four product on the market which compete with DALCA -> BeneFix by Pfizer, Factor IX-Fc by Sanofi Aventis and Idelvian by CSL Behring, Rebinyn by Novo Nordisk.
3. There are already three product competing with the factor IX gene therapie: Spark has phase 3 trial with fidanacogene expected to complete in 2021, uniQure expects to complete in 2023 and freeline  a phase 2/3 trial in 2024.
4. There are no approved treatments for dry AMD, however Appelis has entered a phase 3 trial with a product scheduled to complete in 2021.

But the most important competition, which they do not mention in their own 10k-report, is in my opinion genetic therapy of factor VIII and/or factor IX for patient with hemophilia A/B. It is possible to inject the gene responsible for factor VIII and factor IX through a virus (a vector). After delivery of the virus, the patient will start producing their own factor VIII or factor IX. There are currently several phase 1/2 trials for both of these diseases. If genetic therapy is approved, their product MarzAA will become useless in my opinion for hemophilia...their second product DALCA will also become useless. The reason it will become useless, is because those vectors will have to be administrated only once, according to some data even after 52 weeks patients still have relatively high levels of factor VIII/IX. In other words, this might be a 'cure'. Their third product and fourth product are in pre-clinical phase. From pre-clinical phase to approval by FDA on average it takes 10 years. Good look waiting on these to generate revenu. 

**Conclusion**

The current competition is already fierce. I expect their competitive advantage to be nullified in the short term. In the longer term, say 5-10 years, their main products MarzAA and DALCA will become useless. However, MarzAA may be used for more than just hemophilia. But wether they will be succesful in this remains the question, since the trials for the other indications are only phase 1/2. Their anti-C3-complement and gene therapie for factor IX are in pre-clinical phase, therefore I expect them to generate revenu after 8-10 years at the earliest. 

**Question**

However, the three analyst project that the share price will rise to $20 in 12 months. Based on what? For me it is unclear. How do they come across to this conclusion? How do they calculate the value of $20? Is there something else I have missed in my analysis, please share with me your thoughts. To me it seems extremely risky to buy a start-up company like this which generates no income and enters a market which is so fierce in competition._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Purple Innovation (PRPL) - Over 50% gain since September; Analysts Continue Supporting Story. New plays: IPOB, OAC? As I have posted a handful of times here, Purple continues to be an underappreciated consumer brand growth story utilizing an omni-channel approach. I first posted my recommendation when the shares were back at $18 - see last post here including a link to my original research laying out justification for the price target of $26-$30 in the near term ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j6czzg/purple\_innovation\_prpl\_price\_target\_raised\_to\_37/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j6czzg/purple_innovation_prpl_price_target_raised_to_37/)).

Since then, Oppenheimer raised its target to $37 and UBS initiated coverage calling PRPL the best play in the bedding industry with a price target of $35. Now that the shares have rallied to over $31, I personally have trimmed back the position (though still hold a meaningful amount of long dated 17.5 call positions). With the chart showing the shares hitting an RSI of 70+, we may be churning for a bit or see some retracement ahead of earnings. 

For the stock to meaningfully appreciate from here, we need to see a quarter posting revenues north of $200MM (earnings release in November) and solid guidance. 

Congratulations to all who got in on the dip. It has been a nice run.

Now turning my attention to IPOB (OpenDoor, trading at 3.4x 2021 revenue) while Zillow trades at 5-6x+ forward revenue despite slower growth and a less transformational model. Another play now is also OAC (ForHims) - telehealth platform trading at an implied steep discount to other comps, including TDOC, LVGO, etc. Warrants on OAC still have the favorable structure (no diminution of upside after $18/share) and running their value on the basis of a Black-Sholes/options pricing model implies fair value of $3-$4/warrant vs. the $1.7 price they are now.

I am currently invested in my home country, the philippines and am planning to move some funds to the US market for diversification and also for better choices.

It took awhile before I was able to set an account. Right now, base on my research, it feels like most of the stocks right now is expensive (but who can argue with this since this environment has very low interest rates right now)

Am not keen into tech since valuation seems too high at the moment (unless there are companies that you guys feel I should look into that is currently cheap with a good track record)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A couple of highlights from Dan Loeb's letter: "The world continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid rate. The behavioral and business
changes that surged during the COVID-19 lockdown have, by now, been well-mapped: work
(and exercise) from home, online retail, multiplayer gaming, video on demand, online
payments, and an explosion in biotech research and drug development. COVID-19 has
permanently accelerated fundamental shifts in how we interact with each other and how
digital information is turned into value. These shifts were only possible due to an
exponential increase in broadband capacity, cloud computing infrastructure, artificial
intelligence, VOIP communications, rapid semiconductor innovation, cybersecurity
hardening, and the collaborative technology and business tools to bring it all together. The
evolution of this ecosystem now underpins almost every business we evaluate. As
investors, we must ask ourselves if we wish to engage at the leading edge of this
change or end up as roadkill on what was once quaintly called “the information
superhighway.”	

"Markets reached an all-time high on September 2, before elevated uncertainty about the
election and vaccine timing caused a modest sell-off. Sector rotation was evident
throughout, as tech cooled after a summer of euphoria, and some excess in the market was
wrung out. Many observers have reasonably asked how markets have remained resilient in
a time of historic uncertainty and continued economic suffering for many individuals, a
puzzling disconnect. Markets usually look ahead and it is critical to understand that this is
not a typical recession – one caused by excesses such as over-investment – but a shock
recession which, although rare, historically results in faster retracing because there is no
“imbalance” to unwind before a recovery can begin. For this reason, comparisons to 2008
are inappropriate. The policy response so far, whether through monetary, fiscal, or public
health measures, has been aggressive by historical standards. Assuming a reasonable
expectation of a vaccine early next year, we could see the level of US GDP return to its preCOVID level in the middle of 2021 with a possible fiscal stimulus bill in the first half providing
further impetus. A constructive central case notwithstanding, we are attendant to a number
of risks: a) political wrangling under a potential gridlock post-election scenario, which could
make it harder to enact fiscal support in the event of a faltering recovery; b) a third wave in 
COVID cases; c) a delay in vaccine distribution timing; d) larger-than-anticipated scarring
effects among consumer and businesses, which would be exacerbated by a more protracted
recovery; and e) the path of interest rates."

"Given the economic recovery and generally conducive monetary policies, conditions seem
favorable for asset prices currently. Housing remains robust, inventories are rebuilding, and
financial conditions remain loose. While employment will take time to fully recover,
declining unemployment off a high level is typically good for stocks because earnings growth
is supported by rebounding GDP growth and muted wage pressure. In addition, high slack
in the labor market means there is room to run for the post-COVID expansion. A Fed that is
eager to nurse the economic recovery means that the typical rise in interest rates following
recessions may be more muted, which is supportive for P/E multiples, although a rise in
long-end rates is still likely, especially in the event of a Blue Sweep. Regardless of which
party wins the Presidential election or whether Democrats obtain a majority of Senate seats,
we expect that future stimulus spending will likely outweigh increases in taxation and
regulation that are assured under a Democratic majority and thus have maintained our
positions and exposures as we approach the election."

I held shares and LEAPS on Slack. They had a disastrous Q2 earnings, with minimal growth compared to Zoom. Their stock absolutely plummeted and I lost confidence in their long term potential. I waited a few days to think, believing it was oversold at around $24. At $26 per share, I ended up selling a covered call at a strike of $31 for ~45 DTE, trying to collect premiums until getting exercised. I held onto my LEAP dated for 2022. Unfortunately for me, Slack had a miraculous recovery and is already above my strike today. Despite the poor result in hindsight, I don't mind losing out on a few dollars per share. 

I bought into a couple of EV SPACs on the premise that I could sell covered calls to reduce my risk due to their sky high IVs. However, I realized later that SPACs have a critical flaw in how they had founder's shares and PIPE investors, which can result in the stock cratering due to dilution and the unlocking of PIPE shares. I plan to sell off most of my positions pre merger on green days whenever possible. Unfortunately, I ended up buying HYLN warrants a day before merger, which ended up going down over 50%.

Obviously value stocks haven’t performed this year, that’s why they’re value stocks, no? I think people look at 2020’s best growth stocks and see the excellent performance in a short period of time and automatically assume that value investing is dead. What they seem to forget is that a lot of the popular stocks now would have been fairly considered “value stocks” not even a couple years ago. For example AAPL had a PE of 12 in December 2018. In the early and mid 2010’s people were already dismissing Apple and looking elsewhere for opportunities. But the funny thing is is that AAPL was a “value stock” not even a couple years ago, so how can people reasonably say that value investing died? Isn’t AAPL a classic example of how value investing can win in the end? 

I know PE isn’t everything but it’s a solid tool to use. Here’s some more, MSFT was 100% a value stock until Nadella came in a few years ago and the stock skyrocketed. It had PEs around 10 in 2013 and 2016. People looked at MSFT the same way people look at CSCO or INTC today. 

I think my point is that people say value investing is dead, but the biggest winners of the last few years were “value stocks” that ended up breaking out of their undervalued state and dominating the market. I know AAPL and MSFT are obvious example now but 5,10 years ago they weren’t. 

Thoughts? I could be dead wrong for all I know, and I know that Apple and Microsoft weren’t unpopular stocks at all in that time period, but they weren’t the hottest. XOM and GE and IBM were all the hottest stocks at one time too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ S&P without tech 15 year performance Hi, and thanks in advance.

Thanks again!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Question on Matching Investing Strategies to World Knowledge I am quite new to investing and have a question about which investing strategies to use as matches to having (or believing one has) knowledge about the world.

In other words, if someone believes they have a model of how the world works regarding pandemics, tech, hospitality, etc., and they want to align the MANY investment strategies available to take advantage of that knowledge.

For example:

- If I want to buy into a crash caused by uncertainty around the US election and/or COVID, around the first two weeks of November, what strategy should I use?
- If I want to buy into Recovery Stocks, which are staples like air travel and hospitality that were devastated by the pandemic, what strategy do I use?;
- And finally, if I think that certain stocks like Amazon and Nvidia are so well positioned over time that I believe they will almost definitely improve over the next 2-5 years at least, what strategy do I use for that?

As a novice who has done only initial research, it seems that each type of trading strategy, such as naked options, spreads, or straight stock purchases, might be uniquely suited to certain types of trend or pattern in the markets.

And as a complete noob, I have no idea how to best match those strategies with my (supposed) knowledge. The only advantage I have is knowing how much I don’t know.

My unskilled plan would be something like the following:

- If I’m anticipating a big dip around election time, wait for the general market to crash and buy regular stocks in things that I expect to rebound very quickly, such as Amazon, Zoom, etc.
- If I’m anticipating a vaccine, buy Recovery Stocks now before the vaccine comes out, to be sold within a few months after they recover.
- If I think companies like Zoom and Amazon are going to be fast risers in the next 5-10 years, buy cash-backed PUTs to benefit from the stock or—worst case—be “stuck” with a great stock in the longterm.

This is what I would do right now, given like 3 hours of YouTube study, but I would love to hear how bad this strategy is, and/or what I should study to better approach the situation.

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does the SEC audit ADRs How are they held liable for their balance sheets? I can't seem to find an exact answer to what the process is.   


From SEC;  
"You should understand that non-U.S. companies are subject to financial and other disclosure requirements that differ from those required of U.S. public companies."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding Marketins/Economy I would like to have a deeper and intuitive understanding of the markets/economy/business but I'm not really sure where to start.

It seems that are endless pieces to it all and it's very overwhelming.

I'm not sure if understanding everything is necessary or not.

I'd like to be able to listen to/read financial & economic news and understand it but more importantly understand what it could mean, how one piece of news may affect another area of the economy or market.

I'd like to be able to have fluent conversations about finance and the economy.

Would really appreciate some guidance on some topics to start with and overall the topics I should have a deep understanding of to truly comprehend the markets/economy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When is the stock market too high? When looking at stocks to invest in almost all seem to be at their 52 week high and it seems to make little sense to invest at a 52 week high. However, I have seen people in here say they haven’t invested since June and have missed out on so many gains. Is a collection of stocks being at a 52 week high an indication of a general over price in the market?
How do I know when the stock market is overpriced? (not speculating when I think it will) Is there some key numbers or figure to look at? Or is the market completely untimeable when it comes to something like this? 
I know some big investors say to sell during a long bull market but what constitutes a “long bull market.”
If none of this made sense or I missed some obvious key thing sorry I am a newer investor. 

thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla Weekly Analysis Ep. 2 - Week ending 10/17/2020 Technical analysis on Tesla stock for the week, interesting price targets for upcoming earnings week, both bull/bear case scenarios.  I think it's got bearish momentum after today and definitely see $429 in the cards as mentioned in the video.  Analysis is pretty solid imo.

What are your thoughts of these positions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ how will second covid wave affect the way you invest? Every pandemic has a second wave which is no different to the case of covid-19. History has shown the second wave is always worse than the one that preceded it. Closest example of a pandemic such as covid would be spanish flu/influenza in the early 1900’s and that second wave was nearly 3 times worse as the first wave and even had a third wave.

How will this change the way you will invest if/when a second shutdown occurs? Already european countries are being hit hard and are fearing the second wave is upon them.

Nearly half the united states are seeing numbers as bad if not worse than the summer surge of the virus where many states were on the verge of a second stay at home order/economic pullbacks.

What stocks are “safe” to invest in moving forward? What options are you planning to hold/sell?

The country is already in the throughs of uncertainty with who will be elected president on top of all of this.

One thing I’ve learned in the short time I’ve been investing, is that the market and its investors do not like uncertainty. In my opinion, things are looking pretty spooky and are about to get a lot more uncertain._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good corona stocks that are still cheap? Does anyone have a list of good stocks that have a low change of going BK. Stocks such as stable airlines, banks etc. Investments that have a good chance of going up bigly after a vaccine is announced. I know the time to ask this question was around April but im wondering if a few more of these plays are still around and im missing them. Right now I have delta, Alaskan airlines, Citigroup and bank of America as my long term corona plays. Thanks alot in advanced._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blue Apron will get one last ride during the corona wave All meal kit businesses are killing it. Good Food made 40 percent less revenue than APRN yet Good Food is valued 5x more than APRN. Yes good food is growing faster and has better margins but in no way is this difference in market cap justified. 

I don’t know APRN’s fate long term, but short term they are poised for a 30 percent pop post earnings. They were given an $18 PT in July and are currently trading below $7.

I have 4,650 shares at an average share price of $6.88 and 12 November 20 $6 calls. I like the risk/reward.

Edit #2: 

This is NOT a high conviction trade for me and the google trends are not impressive. But I do believe APRN is in the right place at the right time and that their stock is undervalued. I am not a financial advisor and recommend those that trade this, trade with caution. It could drop 50 percent just as easily as it could rise 50 percent. GLTA.
