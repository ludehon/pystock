 Why was robinhoods excuse bullshit? I am definitely not the most knowledgeable about the stock market and how it works, I just know the basics, so I was wondering why robinhoods excuse for restricting GME shares is bullshit. Everyone here seems to blame them for it and to me their explanation of the clearinghouse deposit requirements seemed to make sense.

Now I am not defending them at all, Im just acknowledging that Im pretty much a casual idiot in these sorts of things and was wondering if someone could explain why their excuse doesnt hold up, as Im guessing if everyone is blaming them this much then there must be a hole in their logic Im not seeing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BANG loss but still holding _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A little bit of gain porn for the weekends, bought in Nov, sold PM Monday.

I'll admit, I am not entirely familiar with Bloomberg Terminal but I use ORTEX and know that a shit ton of the data is usually outdated.

In the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/), OP states that "up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings states institutions currently hold 177% of the float."

[Bloomberg states here](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/Security-Ownership-fact-sheet.pdf) that they use a company's 13F filings to determine security ownership data.

[You can see here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-13f.asp) that 13Fs are only required to be reported quarterly and some institutions purposefully choose to hold off data until the very last day (45 days after end of quarter) to file theirs.

Meaning the main data that OP of the other post is using **is outdated** by at most 4 months.  It doesn't matter if Bloomberg says that it's updated as of today because **companies don't report their fucking trades every single day**.

It is entirely possible that when the Short Interest was at 120% 2-4 months ago that institutions held 177% of the float as that means there were 60M actual shares and 72M synthetic shares created by the shorts, and institutions only had to hold 106.2M of the 132M total.

And it is more than likely that after a shit ton of those shorts closed and a bunch of retail got trapped at a $300+ cost average that the % held by institutions will go down considerably.

Short Interest is also a lagging dataset but S3 and ORTEX both try to estimate it.  ORTEX does so using data from lenders, brokers and broker-dealers who submit inventory and [they believe SI is below 29M](https://imgur.com/hdMd2UL) (too lazy to get an updated screenshot but it's at 26M as of Fri).

I won't even go into the fact that [borrowing fees](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) are back down to 3.7% and Interactive Brokers has shares back that are now lendable.

According to reddit, the top mods of the community were removed for violating rule 5 of the moderator guidelines, which is: "healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins." The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.

Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.

Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since /u/zjz ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.

Do not harass any former moderators. We need to move on from this and put it behind us all. This is the best community on reddit, let's keep it that way.

There’s also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you’re interested you should search it. 

**TL;DNR why BB?**

1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles. 

2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below). 

3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won’t be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn’t understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality. 

**Don’t they make boomer phones?**

No. They don’t make *any* phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround. 

**Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)**

Software. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high. 

They are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's "Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm’s upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO. 

19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX. **With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they’re going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.**

Amazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that’s unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?

And yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it’s making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $6.5B despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much. 

**But it’s still just a meme stock right?**

I’m not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing. 

BB got caught up with those companies because it’s viewed as wsb ‘tards making nostalgic picks. *Which proves my point that people don’t yet get what’s happening with BB.*

BB is not a fling. It’s not based on a squeeze. It’s just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public).

&nbsp;

I spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding GME and its future. I am by no means a financial expert and I guess I am obligated to say this isn’t financial advice. I am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and I hate to see people get taken advantage of. I don’t know that I am 100% right, but hopefully my post helps at least one person. 
&nbsp;

**1. Was there already a squeeze?**

By definition, yes, there was a squeeze. According to the S3 Partners estimates (graph linked below), the short interest on GME fell from approximately 69 million shares on 1/13/21 to 26.39 million shares on 2/3/21. This means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions. 
&nbsp;

**2. What if the short interest data is wrong/intentionally falsified?**

More short interest data will come out on 2/9/21, but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of January. If you think S3 Partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isn’t anything that I am going to say that will change your mind.
&nbsp;

**3. Could there be another squeeze?**

There is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero.
&nbsp;

**4. What would it take to cause another squeeze?**

Since the short interest is significantly lower, it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions. Based on the short interest chart below, it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2/1/21. In order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy, GME bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares. (This was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 1/25/21 through 1/29/21 by an average daily price and adding them together. I chose 1/25/21 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now). Since the current short interest is significantly lower, it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions. 
&nbsp;

**Common Misconceptions:**
&nbsp;

**1. I lost 70+% on my GME shares. I might as well hold since it’s basically worthless.**

This is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources. There are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have. There is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments.
&nbsp;

**2. I should hold for the long play since I am down.**

Unless you purchased GME for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals, this is probably not a great idea. GME is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started (~$5 per share) and even with the new executive leadership, it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term.
&nbsp;

**3. Everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and I don’t want to disappoint them.**

People who are still holding GME and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions, there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money. People telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling. It is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up. It is important to think for yourself and not just hold/buy/sell because someone tells you to. Do your own research and make your own decision. This is not a family or a team, this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves.
&nbsp;

**4. I only lose if I sell.**

You lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell. The idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true.
&nbsp;

**5. I should average down by buying more shares at a lower price.**

Buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares, but it increases your exposure. If the stock continues to fall, you will lose more money.
&nbsp;

**6. We did it before; we can do it again.**

The short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying. We saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze. I agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early, however, that does not mean that it can be done again. There is no longer much media attention on GME and the attention that it is getting is not always positive.
&nbsp;

**7. What about stimulus checks, won’t that cause another squeeze?**

I would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into GME stock. The media attention isn’t there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over.
&nbsp;

**8. All the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up.**

Everyone has a price that they will paper hands at. Some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still. Some people just bought in for the first time. The paper hands traders are definitely not gone.
&nbsp;

**9. By holding, I am sticking it to the man.**

While it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you, it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares. You are not causing them extreme pain by holding. There are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to.
&nbsp;

**10. We are at (insert place) in the VW short squeeze graph.**

This information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come. The VW squeeze was very different to the GME squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading.
&nbsp;

**11. Anyone posting negatively about GME is a bot from the government or the suits.**

I’m not saying there are no bots, but this is not a real argument. A lot of people who haven’t posted on WSB before were just lurkers. The amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out.

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/)

The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. I don't know what the fuck 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.

GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less.

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5](https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5)

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make.

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4](https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4)

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the "squeeze."

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis\_on\_why\_hedge\_funds\_didnt\_reposition\_last/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/)

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. "The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron."

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy to stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently "low" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B.

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a moron like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to "cover," but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

# DD

I was up sniffing glue at 3am on a sunday, when my last TWO brain cells rubbed together and had an epiphany 💡:

>DFV and **BURRY** are two absolute SAVAGES sticking their noses to the ground and 👃sniffing out **VALUE** 😤.  The only color they know is GREEN 🤑 THEY'RE DOING ALL THE LEG WORK FOR US BOYS.

That's when I found [https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-09-30-0](https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-09-30-0).

# Sure, the data is 3 months late by now.  But so are you on your rent payments so listen up.

Looking at **BURRY's** new holdings as of last quarter, he started a 🚨new position🚨 with **800,000 shares** of 💡**$LUMN**💡

What is 💡**$LUMN**💡 you ask?  It's a merger of two boomer ass telecoms CenturyLink and Level3.  It's got the most boring, bag-inducing, 5 year chart you've ever seen.  *Translation:  many bag-holding boomers will sell you covered calls for CHEAP* 🤑🤑🤑

I'm too stupid to read an earnings report, but here's a link to their latest one anyways: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000018926/360b3b44-7408-427c-98bb-c3978b239158.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000018926/360b3b44-7408-427c-98bb-c3978b239158.pdf)

I don't know what the numbers mean.  BUT even my last two smoothened brain cells can understand:

1. TOP LINE (revenue): **DOWN** 📉📉📉  bad bad bad
2. BOTTOM LINE (profits): **UP** 📈📈📈 good good good 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Their **CORE** business is **INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE** delivered over their **FIBER** network (think: **FAST**).  I personally have fiber internet at home, even though it costs me double shifts at Wendy's. It's damn worth it.

ALTOGETHER, what this means is that 💡**$LUMN💡** is **cranking up operating efficiency** in an industry with RAZOR 🪒 thin margins 😬

**BURRY** must have seen this, so he's in. **AND IF HE'S IN, THEN I'M IN.**

&#x200B;

# YOLO

I'm personally **LONG** *3,552* shares and *20* jan2022 $15 calls.  Planning to add more CALLS, IV permitting.

They have an upcoming earnings on Feb 10.  We're about to catch a glimpse of the moon. 🚀🚀🚀🌝

💡**$LUMN**💡is a cash cow paying a $1.00 dividend per year.  *What's a fu\*king dividend??? I don't know but I heard you can pay rent with it.  Keep in mind that if you buy calls, you don't get the dividend. And no dividend = no rent money.*

Literally cannot go tits up.  Market is valuing 💡**$LUMN**💡 with a PE of 10 while its competitors have PEs in the 20s. Means that 💡**$LUMN**💡 is an easy **DOUBLE-UP** once the market sees the light 💡.   *What's a fu\*king PE ratio??? Again, I don't know, google it you dummie.*

*^(Disclaimer:)*  ^(I. LIKE. THE. STOCK.   I am not an investment professional, nor is this investment advice. Please do your own analysis and due diligence before making any investment decisions.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A guide to the Moon for new investors around here. This came from a conversation with a friend who's getting into the game a bit. I started trading right before Rona (Feb 23rd I picked my stocks, before J-Pow even unveiled the money machine!). I use strategies ranging from dedicated ETF portfolios to charting, and have found success in both (trading account around 130% this year). Here's some help based on what I've seen on here over the last year and the pretty significant reading I've done on investing theory-  


1. Start finding formulas that work. That’s a good way to learn a lot about different elements of a stock For example, a “buffet” style approach might have you look for a PB under 1 and a PE under 15, throw that in the screener (I like [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4)) Find filters that stand out to you and google them. Play around and you'll learn what's useful to you.  

2. Cross it with some trading strats. See which the best trades are based on those Then do some real DD (personally I check the financials a bit, Google news, Reddit search, and then whatever else makes sense at the time). "Time in beats timing" for sure, but there's no reason not to understand what RSI is. Having more tools to make decisions with is usually a good thing, just dont use them all every time.  

3. Expect to lose some trades, but it’s the price of the lesson. Losing money isn't that bad if you stick to the rule of only investing what you can afford to lose.  

4. Things that make sense sometimes don’t actually make sense because of some absolute shenanigans. It happens. Move on and laugh it off. There's forces at play that you don't even know exist.  

5. Don’t get cocky, it makes you sloppy. Develop a system and stick to it. Do you only invest in companies with positive PE ratios? Sure, if you have a reason for it why not. Change when the evidence suggests it should, but remember to keep learning new ways to evaluate and cross check moves.  

6. Largely disregard other people’s opinions, as they’re based on their situations. Someone who just bought a house will have a very different approach than someone in college, and someone with $2k has a different approach than someone with $20k, and $200k.  

7. YouTube is really helpful, so is Reddit, but keep in mind they all have personal motives and likely already own the stock they’re talking about so they are pumping it. Not that that’s a disqualifier, but it is a factor.  

8. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. It can be a lot of fun to experiment, and 'losing money' on a lesson learned can be more valuable than a monetary gain if it helps you make better choices in the future.  

9. Once you start having significant profits, it gets a lot easier to take losses. When you can lose $1k and still be positive by a healthy percent, it’s nbd. You'll get there, be patient and consistent. $1k seemed hard, and then $10k seemed hard. They say $100k is the hardest, but it’s really just discipline. It’s not like we’re throwing money at garbage, and we have thought out systems guiding our decisions (develop those)  

10. The coolest thing is how it compounds. It’s actually my favorite thing in the world. The snow falls on last weeks snow and gets bigger and bigger. Eventually, there's so much snow that it causes an ice age.  

11. Other people’s limits are not yours. Just cus they can’t do it doesn’t mean you can’t. This is all pretend, and literally anything is possible. Don’t get discouraged by bears, they just don’t see green. 'The crash' has been coming since April, but "time in beats timing"  

12. Take breaks. You don’t need to make every dollar on the market, and it can deff get addicting/drive you to a breakdown since there’s so much to learn  

13. There’s a lot of noise. Tune it out and focus on your niche. You’ll find what you’re good at by experimenting, and the trend changes about every two weeks, so it’s pretty fun!  

14. Knowledge is a great investment. I haven’t bought a single piece of investment literature/course that I regretted (check out One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch or Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel)  

15. For every buyer there’s a seller. Someone has the exact opposite opinion of you on every move.  

16. When listening to old wisdom, consider that the infrastructure that makes today’s trading possible wasn’t even an idea yet (discount brokers, social media trading, internet, the lack of fees). The new rules enable a new approach.  

17. Whats best for you is different than whats best for me. You need to go through the learning process to grow as a trader and investor. And there is a big difference between trading and investing. Both are viable, as they both make money, and I find using them in tandem is most effective.  

18. Lock in your profits. If you can protect your initial investment, do it.  

19. "Get money, buy income." Take your trading wins and roll them into safer dividend moves to lock in your victories, or open new positions! (This is for trading, buy and hold your investments. Again, there is an important difference)  

20. Please learn what a share of a company actually is, why they go up and down, and what market price actually means. This will allow you to make much more informed decisions.  


Hope this helps someone! Keep those fists clenched and tendies coming. Ik this isn't quite as memey as the regular posts here, but there are a LOT of new members who likely don't get the culture and may have trouble distinguishing

I've been following Aston Martin for the last 3 months and here some DD So been tracking James Bonds favorite car company for the last few months and all I can say is I'm glad I put money into it as its currently up 25%. 

Early last year the ass fell out of the company and  they almost went bankrupt. This is where the big man billionaire Lawrence Stroll entered and bought a massive stake in the company and used his contacts at Daimler Mercedes to help turn them around. 

Mercedes currently own a 5% stake in AM which will rise to 20% in the next few years. 

AM have a technical partnership with Mercedes to supply technology for engines, mechanical and electronic parts. 

They will have their own F1 team this year which is free advertising and promotion to a global audience. They are also supplying the safety cars this year instead of Mercedes. 

The head of AMG is now tasked with turning the company around. He is more than capable and with Mercedes getting a 20% stake they are not going to let it fail after all their investment. 

Stock is currently priced very low. Look at the graphs from 12 months ago before the new guys stepped in. If we get back to those levels then it would be more than a 400% increase from where we're at now. 

Their new car the DBX has been recieved very well and it caters to a new market of family friendly Aston rather than supercars. When they switch to EV they will have all Mercedes tech to play with. 

Get on board early and get into a position to get blasted on Martinis and buy some sick James Bond cars (headlight rocket launchers and ejector seats not included).

Link to Financial Times article with Tim Moers 
https://amp.ft.com/content/33613086-dbcb-4720-9805-49544200944d

Pasted from article
The brand will release 10 derivatives of existing cars within two years including two offshoots of its new DBX sport utility vehicle, as part of a planned model offensive, he told the Financial Times.

Mr Moers wants to refocus the company on engineering and bring more of its development in-house from suppliers, while working more closely with Mercedes-Benz to produce bespoke engines for the company.
Daimler, Mercedes’ parent company, owns a fifth of Aston’s shares and already supplies the British carmaker with some technology.
He also plans to boost Aston’s German engineering outfit, which is based at the country’s famous Nürburgring race circuit.
“Our technology partnership is there [in Germany], all the engineering suppliers are there, we should do something there to get the most efficiency out of the whole corporation,” he said.
Mr Moers was parachuted into the role from head of Mercedes’ AMG, the high performance subsidiary, over the summer by Aston’s chairman Lawrence Stroll, who led a rescue of the business earlier in the year.
Mr Stroll aims to restore the marque’s luxury credentials, and has installed a team he believes will help the business begin generating positive cash by 2023.
His arrival at the company this year also coincided with a large-scale clear-out of its executive team.
As well as a new chief executive and chairman, within the last year the company has replaced almost every top flight position, including the most senior executives in finance, sales, product planning, operations, engineering and the US, its largest international market.
The company has pushed back its first battery electric model, which will now be an Aston Martin instead of a Lagonda, the luxury sub-brand that is part of the group. The company has yet to reveal its new plans for the Lagonda nameplate.
“The electric car has to be an Aston Martin,” said Mr Moers, “because if you bring a new brand to life for electric vehicle cars, that’s wrong in my perspective.”


Edit - currently in for 28.6 shares at £16.31 with more when I get paid. 

Also I'm still in for GME with a couple of shares. Managed to get out at gains of 270%.

Edit 2 - I have just been added to a controversial subreddit because this doesn't fit with your gamestonk narrative which is hilarious. Before most of you joined this subreddit it was for people to post their DD around potentially risky plays on the stock market and then post loss and gain porn not fluff peoples egos because you're balls deep in a meme stocks and latching on to optimism. The stock market is so much bigger than AMC and GME and whilst most of you are waiting for the short squeeze to happen (if it ever does) most of us who got out early enough or have spare capital like to spunk our money elsewhere._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Elon Tweeting this out could be the last chance to save all the meme stock bagholders (Full video + audio in description) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just a thought... First, the formalities:
Not exactly new to investing, but still going through my paces. New to WSB, fresh retard here, bough into FOMO, holding because I have nothing much left to lose. 13 shares of GameStonks @130 avg. 11 of AMC at "idc, like $13 or something"

Now. I see so many posts about "you only see the message the mods want you to see" and also do many "sell and cut your losses" posts.
But I've also seen some well thought out DD on GME, and I have massive confirmation bias for this, seeing as I'm banking on it to go up to "win my money back" (money I *could* lose, but really don't want to.)
I'm not selling, I don't have too much left to lose at this point, I'd rather stay in it on the chance of a second squeeze.

But back to the main idea here: I've seen a lot of "sell, cut your losses, reinvest" posts. I've seen a few notably good DD's on a probable second GME squeeze.
I'll two and two together, and that adds up quite nicely with that old advice about "buy when others are selling".
Point is, I got into this on mob mentality and hype. I learned my fuvking lesson about that, and now I'm sitting on >50% loss. But it doesn't seem quite right to get out of this on mob mentality, right after learning that lesson.

Two reason's I'm staying and holding then:
1. I have little left to lose on this, I believe that GME fundemental are changing enough so that selling now would be at a low, which is a terrible. "How much worse can it get?". I'm willing to gamble what I have left for the next week or three on the DD and possible second squeeze.
2. If everyone is here for thier own gain, and everyone really IS manipulating my noobiness for thier own profit, and those same people are the ones telling me to sell, then I'm not fucking selling. I'm not selling and getting left in the dust like this. If have to die on this hill, then good luck killing me, because I already have.

I have a gut feeling that this is the dark part of the tunnel, and I'm not quitting just because I can't see the light at the other end. This is the part of the movie where all seems lost, right before the final spectacular triumph. I'm gonna be there for the end.

To all the other holders out there:

If you can pull out with gains, or at least minimal losses, then evaluate your position and decide what is best for your situation, your mental health, and your long-term stability. Don't gamble your life on a meme, even if it's more than just a meme. Keep a stock as a souvenir or a ticket to the launch, if you do decide to leave. I think you would regret selling at a loss now, but there's the chance that it could be the right decision. Either way, pull through and commit to and live with that decision. Most importantly, take away your lessons. Write them down, or tell someone else exactly how you feel right now, and what you think you should remember from this.

If you're in this like me, balls deep and waiting for the squeeze, then I think our best move is to HOLD together. I don't think that selling for substanial losses is worth it at this point. Look at it. You sell now for -50% or more, decide to take a break, put it in an index or something and it grows a measly 8%? Meanwhile, you'll be glued to GME. Imagine if it moonshots. Your realized losses might feel bad, but it will be all that much worse if just a week or even a day later it moons, and you took your losses in vain. I think the game is worth it.

Either way, I would wait for us to get numbers on the 9th, that's when we will be the best informed to make our decisions. I foresee a lot of quality DD on that data we get, so watch out for that.
Hedges seem scared, that gives me a bit of heart too. What have they to be scared of if it's all truly over?


TL;DR: 
Ignore the haters, check your fundamentals, make a realistic assessment of your situation and your risk. Wait for the data on the 9th.
If minimal losses or gains, I suggest hold, as this is probably rock bottom, and we only go up from here. But make your own decision, based on your financial stability.
If balls deep and all in, I say HOLD, and hold strong through this week.
We're in the worst part of it right now, but no one ever said it would be easy. The best things never are.

For those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.

Earnings. Tuesday February 9th

First, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)

**Q3 2020 Highlights**

\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year

\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year

\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year

\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)

\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year

\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year

\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year

\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year

\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share

\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**

**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year

**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**

\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”

\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”

&#x200B;

**Catalysts for Growth**

According to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),

\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.

**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.

**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020

\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.

\- According to Corsair

\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019

\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming

\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019

\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms

\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.

&#x200B;

**Market Share**

\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.

  

**Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**

**-** Keyboards: 2nd

\- Mice: 3rd

\- Headsets: 4th

\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd

\- Performance Controllers: 2nd 

\- Memory: 1st 

\- Cases: 1st 

\- Power Supply Units: 1st 

\- Cooling Solutions: 1st 

&#x200B;

**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well.

\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).

These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale

\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals.

\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.

&#x200B;

**Competitor Comparison**

**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech.

\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.

\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million share float (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)

Somehow got $250,000 in margin for ARKK because I kept buying and never received an error message so now I'm holding $350,000 in ARKK. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If You Don’t Know Whether The GME Squeeze Has Squoze, You’re Right (Disclaimer - this was a reply I posted in a previous thread - you may have already Reddit. Also not a financial advisor do your own DD)
_____________________

To those who think the squeeze has squoze and those who have not. You’re both right 

To state the obvious, last week Hedge funds were caught completely off guard and there was a massive massive gamma squeeze / short seller meltdown which crescendoed Thursday morning. 

Many are looking to the next short report to determine how squozen we truly are. Do not place too much faith in the 2/9 short report. It won’t tell you much imo. 

Why? We sat at 100% short interest for 6 months+ with no squeeze. Squeezes require catalysts and multiple catalysts are in play at the moment. 

So how do you determine if HF and others are still massively short? 

One Answer: check your own broker. Can you short the stock? Are there shares available? If cost to borrow is over 15% and/or there are no shares available - it’s a crowded short no matter what the report says. You can likely check on the weekends too. 

The current rate on IBKR is 3.7% and there are 800k shares available to borrow. This rate is lower than the previous average of ~20%. Shares available to borrow  have been anywhere from 0 to 1 million.  So IBKR to me indicates some potential covering and slightly less squeeze potential. 

But also keep in mind, if the short report says 44% of the float is short - this is still insanely high and about 2x what I would consider a crowded idea (20% is crowded imo). So don’t be fooled into thinking the covering is over even if short interest dips to lower levels. 

To me it feels like Old Wall wants the price down. Why? I’m not sure exactly. But even the dreamers on Twitter who have spent the past year pumping Tesla think GME is a bubble. Lol. People thought the Tesla bubble popped last year in Feb when it peaked at $968.99 (pre split, so actually $190 versus $850 today.  Again. People thought the Tesla bubble popped at $190.)

As for GME, Hedgeye had a $100pt. Citron covered and is scared to short. Lots of other hedgies will probabaly never pile in short to this name lest they have to explain to investors why they were burned twice. 

I don’t think RC bought at $16, risked locking up his money for a long time, simply to EaRN 5 pECEnT PeR YEar. 

Insiders haven’t sold except for one. Company hasn’t sold and is instead pumping the news flow up with Amazon hires. DFV was in at $4. He could have sold at $60 and have still been a legend.

Dr. Burry is currently - as recently as last night - been tweeting about Gamma squeezes. 

So let’s not pretend like any of us know exactly what’s going on. But uncertainty creates opportunity. 

If everyone knew we were going to squeeze again, the price would be much much higher and you wouldn’t be able to buy at these levels. 

This is still a highly volatile situation. In my opinion, the risks are extremely high both ways but I would be terrified to be short right now. 

Mainstream media’s mis-reporting of GMEs prospects, literal trading suppression by brokerages, threats of investigations, etc - if you just think about it - can only be doing one thing which is holding the price down. 

So to the extent GME is being manipulated at all, it’s very much to the downside imho. 

While it’s frustrating to be misunderstood by big media, big Twitter - whatever. In the end, it literally will not matter. 

The ball spiking that CNBC did to Elon and TSLA while they were down - may have felt good at the time to them. But boy did it cost them in the long run. 

And it’s not like CNBC made a mistake and then changed course overnight. They tried to FUD Tesla into oblivion through the entirety of 2020 while the price ripped in their face relentlessly. And then ripped some more. And some more. Sound familiar?

This suppression can be reversed explosively with:

More Insider Buying
New Insider Buying
Strategic Partnerships
Earnings Beat
More short covering 
Possible Gamma Squeeze Round 2 (I think unlikely)
RC memes


Speaking of Gamma squeezes - and I would love some fact checking on this - but I think one of the reasons we cannot repeat is because deep OOTM ($800) calls now exist. MM can hedge with those rather than only through purchasing shares which they had to do when every call written was a Delta 1, thus very in the money. 

But finally - an investment thesis that relies on a squeeze is not much of a thesis. It’s really a combination of A) the market realizing fundamental value is much higher all at once .... which causes B) forced short covering with limited exit paths. 

VW squeezed for purely non fundamental reasons and it came back down to earth.  I firmly believe GME “squeezed” for fundamental reasons which could make this rally far more sustainable. Again, see Tesla. 

Just take a look at RC, e commerce valuations, and the types of $$ GME is doing. There’s value here. 

Other than all that. I have no opinion on the matter. Excuse incoherent rambling and any typos._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB's Many Clients and Partners Blackberry Clients and Partners

I've been watching what's going on with great interest. There have been many things I can't explain. So I sat down and did a Think. But I know we're all just simple apes here, so why don't I tell you a bedtime story instead?

**Story Time**

Imagine there's a GME market participant, looking for a quick buck, with not the best grip on morality. I know that's a big stretch, but just go with me. We'll call him 'Snidely'.

Snidely is big into shorts, where you borrow a stock from someone, sell it immediately, and have to buy it from someone else later. But normal shorting isn't quite exciting enough for him. He wants to go naked. A naked short is when you skip that whole 'borrow' step at the beginning.

So Snidely notices that, due to [17 CFR 242.203 b 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3), he can issue a short without actually having to go through the annoyance of borrowing it, and has 13 "settlement" ("business") days to actually find someone willing to lend him that stock. This is great news for Snidely! It means that he can sell a stock he made up on the spot, then look for ideal times in the next 2-3 weeks to find someone he can borrow from to un-make it. So long as the stock price even temporarily falls below his sale price sometime in the timeframe, he can make money by borrowing at that point. He just found a freakin' cheat code for cash!

And so Snidely issues the naked short sell, and sells off his newly minted "stock". He finds ample buyers, and has no problems with that bit. Shucks, he can actually sell a little under market level if he needs to - After all, he can always just print more stock. Hahaha, Snidely goes brrrrr.

But then the unthinkable happens. Some idiots actually buy the stock, and the price stays higher than he bought for the entire 13 settlement day period. FUCK. Now he HAS to borrow, or he loses access to his wonderful money printer, as per [17 CFR 242.203 b 3 iv](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3_iv).

So he does. And loses some money. It sucks. Oh, and the stock price went up, because he had to buy so much. And then some moronic internet forum notices him doing this, and starts to buy too. Fuck. FUCK. If this idiots actually manage to peg the stock at this level, he'll be out of a job. He might actually have to buy the cheap caviar, or whatever it is the poors eat.

So Snidely looks in his bag of tricks... and only sees one trick. And so he begins naked short selling stocks that he knows he doesn't have yet. He does it a little below market rate, because that helps cool the stock off, which helps him. He has 13 whole days for the stock price to drop, after all. He uses the money from the new shares to start borrowing shares to cover his old ones. Weirdly, the liquidity isn't as low as the numbers would suggest, and he's able to borrow enough to cover his position fairly easily.

Plot twist - Snidely isn't the only Snidely. Snidely is legion. And as each Snidely pursues this plan, the stock price drops, since they all feel comfortable selling a little below market. And while they're covering, they *buy up each other's made up stocks*.

They haven't fixed the problem. They've just moved it 13 settlement days down the road. And made it bigger.

And once one of them starts buying to cover their new position, the rest will panic and join in, and the stock will soar again.

**Evidence**

Sooo... if this story is somewhat true, what events should we have already seen?

* We should expect to see a slightly less than 13 settlement day period between stock increases, because if Snidely's wait too long they lose access to the ability to naked short. Given that GME first jumped in price on [Jan 12th](http://www.google.com/search?q=gme), then again on the 26th, that gives an 11 day period - Exactly in line with what we expect.
* We should expect to see anger and push back from wall street in that same slightly-less-than-13-settlement-day period, fading rapidly as they choose to 'cover' their positions by selling more fake shares. This is more or less exactly what we saw on this subreddit.
* Shorts should be extremely eager to tell us the closed out their positions, because they also opened new positions and NEED the stock to go back down before their time limit runs out. Yup, we sure as fuck saw that.
* We should have seen Failure-to-deliver figures high, and growing. [Yup, that's exactly what we see in GME.](https://wherearetheshares.com/)
* We should expect to see a sky-high official short rate that *isn't* reflected in third party data. We already see that in the existing data.
* We should see the SEC being uninterested in the shorts/Snidely, because no actual laws were broken by this behavior. And wow would "uninterested in the shorts" be a motherfucking understatement for what the SEC is up to.

**Anti-Evidence**

Some stuff doesn't fit neatly into this theory, and needs other explanations or caveats.

* Robinhood and other brokers shutting off buying is not directly explained by this. Buuuut I feel like the current explanations of increased capital requirements due to Snidely-induced volatility mostly does a fine job of explaining this.
* We shouldn't see firms resorting to illegal tactics like ladder attacks, since they can accomplish their goals legally. But every instances of a 'ladder' attack we've seen is better explained by a Snidely bulk selling naked shorts.
* The push for the fake 'Silver squeeze' is not explained by this. I think that was just an opportunistic play, rather than an actual distraction attempt.

**Predictions**

* An actual short squeeze will never happen. The Snidely's can just print more naked shorts whenever they need them.
* We should see Failure-to-deliver figures jump when the next data dump occurs. [Watch here.](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)
* We should see a growing official short interest that isn't reflected in third party figures.
* *We should expect to see a massive rise in the stock price about 11-13 settlement days after the last large stock rise. Which puts the date for expected movement around Feb 10-12*

**Conclusions**

Sorry friends, this isn't a VW-style short squeeze, infinite squeeze, or rocket to the moon. It's a fucking interstellar yoyo that's going to keep shooting up higher and higher in nearly-13 day intervals until *something* breaks.

Stock owners aren't the bag holders. The Snidely's are.

**Dirkson, what should I doo^o^o^o ?**

Oh, hell if I know. I'm not a lawyer, your lawyer, a stock dude, CPA, CFA, CFP, or whatever. I'm just some idiot who thought it was a good idea to buy two shares at $300. I wasn't even one of you before the Vast Migration, and I still don't talk right.

None of this is legal or financial advice, I'm just discussing what I think is happening. Think for your own damn self!

**TL;DR**

No🚀🌕. Yes ⭐🪀⭐.

If you were faced 70 BILLION in the hole, losing to self proclaimed retards, autists, and degenerate gamblers you’d be doing EVERYTHING in your power to not lose.

I read a post that said this is financial warfare, we’re in WWIII right fucking now. It’s the 99% vs the 1%. It wasn’t a joke. We broke the market last Thursday and they want to keep us down. 


It will not be a big swoop, currently it’s psychological warfare - want confirmation look at any social media or main stream media. They’re either silent or telling you you’re an idiot. The hedge funds want you to sell, they want you to feel like an actual retard. Look at the Melvin citadel tropic thunder meme, look at the “ladder attack” meme. Fuck look at all the shit head memes that are not making any of us feel good. 

#hold the fucking line because this IS bigger than all of us. Realise your place in history and take part in showing Wall Street that retail investors can say what the price is at. 

These fucks are mad that you are not doing what they say and what they want to you to do. The free market was established to let the people (common people) invest in what they want & make bank collectively. 

With every decision you make comes a form of belief, which is a truth in this world. You believe in love, laughter, family yet it can’t defined by any one word sentence or photograph. The shorts -are- still higher than the float, and what the fuck are people missing here?? 
WE LIKE THE STOCK BUY THE STOCK STOCK GOES UP HOLD THE STOCK UNTIL WE FUCKING WIN. You’ll know when we’ve won. 

I’m fucking disgusted by what this sub has become. Infiltrated by bots, shills, provocateurs. The old crowd might never come back unless we grow a pair of balls stop wallowing in self pity and fight together like the wallstreetbets we are. 

Please think for yourself. Do not yolo your life savings in hopes it will rocket to the moon, do not put yourself at risk of losing the little stability you’re holding onto right now in hopes this will be your light in the glory hole tunnel. 

But if you can... Do you want to stick it to the people who said “hell is coming” and then made BILLIONS of dollars off the little people??? Do you want to fight for the people who worked 20 years day and night to grow their restaurant, ma and pa retail stores who are locally owned??? Fucking fight for all of those people. The situation seems absolutely ludicrous and ridiculous that THIS RIGHT HERE is our fight, but do not get confused or allow the media to gaslight you. We DID break the market, we did make every single hedge fund shit their pants but this fight isn’t fucking over. 

You need to dig deep as this is emotional, hope is emotional, making a change and defeating a bully is hard as fuck. LOOK AT EPSTEIN. Guilty as mother fucking sin. We don’t even have a mother fucking answer about that one. 


You think the people in charge are just going to give up? That they won’t pull every single dirty, manipulative, callous, petty, illegal trick in the book to make sure a bunch of autists and retards lose it all??? Fucking wake up and ask yourself where you want to be next week, a year from now. Do you want to look back 20 years and feel like you got fucked in the ass?? Fuck no. It’s that simple. Hold the fucking line and make sure everyone else does the same (within reason!!) or we deserve the royal ass fucking these elites give you every single day, stroking it to the loses you took in 08. 

This is not financial advise. I’m not a financial advisor and fuck you to everyone trying to destroy mother fucking retail AGAIN.

Okay so, hear me out...

O.G. Shareholder Hold All 100 shares and refuses to sell (there is zero market liquidity, zero supply to even one buyer = infinite demand to supply ratio; share price skyrockets)

Short Seller borrows 50 shares to sell to the market (liquidity emerges, supply and demand becomes a rational ratio, prices stabilize)

O.G. Shareholder buys 'new' shares directly from the market (all 50, s/he is willing to pay the price to get every share out of the market's hands).

Original shares = 100

Borrowed shares = 50

O.G. Shareholder = 150 Shares

Then O.G. shareholder calls the 50 borrowed shares back... and refuses to sell.

Is this something that can happen? And if so, what is the absolute cheapest stock on the market (market-cap-wise, I mean) that allows options trading?

Asking for a friend.
_______________________

*edit: Seems like if a company is 100% owned by a single investor it is no longer a publicly owned company, and would get delisted. This still raises two questions:

1) What happens if there are already short sold shares out there floating and someone just buys up enough shares to own 100% of the company. Do the shares then get called back in order to delist the company? Does the company simply get delisted with one individual owning more shares than originally existed?

B) How many people would have to own 100%, collectively, in order for this to occur "organically" within the market (at which point the company does NOT get delisted)? Obviously y'all are gonna be like 'cOlLuSiOn iS iLlEgAl" but yeah like we haven't seen plenty of collusion and no one got sent to jail for it. One of y'all said it best on another thread: SEC fines are just budgeted in.

Forgive the degenerate writing, I just like this stock and want others to know about it. 

**What is Southwest Airlines?** 

**Southwest Airlines Co.** is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier.  The airline was established on March 15, 1967, by Herb Kelleher as **Air Southwest** Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

Southwest operates a leisure-focused low-cost carrier, **which is well-positioned for a leisure-led post-pandemic recovery in aviation**.  Southwest has generally been able to achieve low-cost carrier unit expenses and passenger yields close to legacy carrier levels.  **Southwest’s focus on providing low fares could allow it to make inroads with business travel in the current recessionary environment.**

**Why get in now?**

1.  **CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion on Shares of Southwest Airlines Co.**

* "We lift our target to $53 (from $48), 20x our 2022 EPS estimate (raised to $2.79 from $2.66; 2021 unchanged)." 
* Q4 adjusted EPS of -$1.29 vs. $0.98 beat consensus by $0.39. 
* Revenue fell 65% Y/Y in Q4 as the pandemic continued to depress air travel demand. **Yet, despite the quarter’s major resurgence of Covid-19, which led to new travel restrictions and business closures, LUV’s revenue grew 12% vs. Q3.** Such strong sequential revenue growth in this harsh environment suggests that there is significant pent up air travel demand. We think this demand will start to be unleashed this Spring as vaccines become widely distributed, allowing LUV to soundly beat revenue and EPS estimates for 2021. 
* Additionally, despite the unprecedented demand weakness, **LUV has maintained a strong balance sheet with negative net debt throughout the pandemic.** 
* Manageable debt, strong customer loyalty, and efficient operations will lead LUV to be the first major airline to recover profitability, in our view, which we expect midway thru Q2. 

[ For the first quarter 2021, analysts estimate LUV will earn -$1.90 non-GAAP per share, a decrease of 1,168.00&#37; over the prior year first quarter non-GAAP results. ](https://preview.redd.it/nfs70jt76xf61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de9a23e3ff7d48c85c818d94c6272ec13ff2ab)

2.  Southwest has used the pandemic as an expansion opportunity, adding 14 new destinations since March 2020.   Overall, the 14 new destinations added or announced by Southwest since March 2020: 

* Chicago O’Hare (ORD)
* Houston Bush Intercontinental (IAH)
* Jackson, Mississippi (JAN)
* Savannah, Georgia (SAV)
* Miami and Sarasota in Florida
* Fresno (FAT), Palm Springs (PSP) and Santa Barbara (SBA) in California
* Colorado Springs (COS), Montrose/Telluride (MTJ), and Steamboat Springs (HDN) in Colorado
* Cozumel (CZM) in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

[$LUV recovery is going well as the pandemic persists.   Massive demands for travel coming in March... Summer of 2021 will be a record for air travel... Thanksgiving and Christmas will be off the charts... ](https://preview.redd.it/4k8twynv4xf61.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=574a353ca0e66a0ff9a841319fa0b29641e3e481)

3.  Passenger traffic is likely to be severely depressed until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed.

* Southwest no longer operates only Boeing 737 aircraft.  Unit expenses are likely to decrease, as the 737 MAX is recertified (as of November 18th, 2020).
   * LUV is the king of US domestic air travel and has the strongest balance. 115 million Americans will be fully vaccinated by Summer, another 100 million by end of Summer. These 215 million will be living life like 2019. The other 115 million by New Years. LUV will be back to 2019 peaks in 2022. **Buy now for the bargain pricing. It will be a bumpy flight for a while, but calm and smooth in 2022.** 
* Ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, show that the leisure market can serve consumers that are particularly cost-conscious.

&#x200B;

Below is a chart that compares the 5 day performance of the GVIP ETF vs the S&P 500.

https://preview.redd.it/1h510wt7zwf61.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=492289c4e6f30184c160a133188a3e9331e17f7d

Over the last week (Friday last week to Thursday this week) GVIP has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2.3%. That's a TON. Furthermore if you do the same comparison for Monday this week to Thursday the outperformance of GVIP rises to approximately 4.4%, for Monday-Friday the outperformance was 2.3%

To put this into perspective look at the historical performance of these two side by side since Jan 1st 2017 (essentially inception of GVIP) and you can see that GVIP in the past has modestly outperformed the s&p 500 with GVIP returning on average (roughly) 1.69% per month and the S&P 500 returning on average (roughly) 1.12% per month (A total of 127% gain for GVIP and a 73% gain for S&P 500 over \~49 months). 2%+ out performance over a short period of time (a week or less) is massive variance to the long term monthly averages.

My hypothesis here: Hedge funds have been increasing short bets (on gamestop and other stocks) and plowing the cash they are receiving from the short sales into their favorite stocks. This pumps GVIP higher explains some of the difference in short term performance

**#2: Short Volume has increased as a percent of total volume**

First up its important that I note the different between short VOLUME and short INTEREST. Short volume refers to the number of shares sold/bought in short trades each day. Short interest is the total outstanding number of shorted shares.

A large increase in short volume as a percent of total volume indicates that something is going on. As you can see from the chart below this new activity started on 12/27 (the day that gamestop had the highest price) and continued. While its hard to tell what is actually going on here it looks like there has been a paradigm change

My thesis/opinion: Short sellers have been doubling down with the recent price increases. A combination of a high amount of short selling (as a percent of total volume) and lower liquidity is fueling the current price drop

**#3: Price changes in gamestop stock seem to be strategically timed with short interest reports**

Every 15 days the SEC requires shorts sellers to report their positions. This information is then made public 7 days later. It just so happens that 1/29 was the reporting date for short interest (to be published 2/9). I've placed 4pm on 1/29 on a chart of gamestop below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7wf4nfhg0xf61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dbefb85fe92c694ca2765112c8c64fdac48eac0

My opinion: Short sellers want to give the impression that they closed their positions - so that we get paper hands. To do this they exited (or pretended to exit by substituting their positions for naked sold call options) leading up to the reporting deadline. Now they may have started to re-enter those positions

**#4: Anecdotal evidence**

4a: People have been posting screencaps to this subreddit that shows overwhelming good sentiment for gamestop stock. One of the things I've seen pop up on this sub lately is the total volume of buy/sell orders from retail brokerages. These have been skewing very positive still. If its not the retail investors selling, then it must be institutions either exiting long positions or starting new short positions

4b: The diamond hands on WSB are real, and sentiment has been fairly positive (despite sub drama, and a massive price drop)

4c: It appears there is a continued effort to spread disinformation and to keep the stock price down. Anyone seen those advertisements for silver lately? Why would someone go to all this effort if short positions have been exited?

4d: S3 partners estimate of short interest (as of about 7pm on 2/4) is around 26MM shares (see below). This is down from the official short interest number on 1/15 of 61MM shares. If we truly underwent a short squeeze, would half of them still be here?

https://preview.redd.it/f9j635jt0xf61.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9581436ed635e04f42f0e261350d0a7963a18ba

**#5: Interactive Brokers Short Interest Data on 2/5**

On Friday (2/05) morning we experienced a big jump in gamestop's stock price (to around $82 by 10am). Around the same time the short share availability dropped over 1MM shares at interactive brokers for gamestop.

[The first column is the borrowing cost, second column is number of shares available](https://preview.redd.it/vc38orqv1xf61.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b86977a889343bd18c9b01d56d22ec6d33d01a)

My Thesis: While short share availability can drop for a number of reasons (and there is no requirement to immediately sell borrowed shares) its my opinion that that someone borrowed a bunch of shares from interactive brokers and shorted the morning's spike which halted momentum in the stock price

\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR:

My opinion: What we experienced the other day was a half baked short squeeze, the game isn't over and shorts are still playing. However, these shorts may have taken positions at higher prices and lower borrowing rates (see above screenshot) and therefore may be harder for gamestop to shake.

I haven't invested as Covid-19 really nuked my income. But I've been following the story and wow it's amazing what's been done. Feels like the first good thing to happen in this country after a very long period of bullshit jenga.

Anyways, I don't think I'm the only one that thinks the story is getting a bit complicated. There are those that say hold and those that say sell. 

Forgive me if I'm waaay off but I've never even dabbled in stocks, but I don't think I'm completely hopeless. Correct me if I'm wrong here:

* The shorts that hedgfunds were holding have already been sold right? Because robinhood forced the price to go down so that the hedge funds could minimize their loses before they were forced to sell. I assume the shorts were sold as MSM are reporting the losses at 50billionish. I guess I'm asking if the squeeze is still going on or if it happened and now there is another squeeze going to happen or what?

* If that's right why are people on WSB still holding?? Also with people cashing out which I don't see as bad, because the whole point was the screw over the %1 and take that money from them put it in our pockets, I would assume right now is the best time to short. Right??

* In what situation would GME go back up right now??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Second post about why selling 30% together will cause the spike and why Gamma squeeze didnt happen. I posted earlier about cutting loss on 30% on your GME together will do the magic. 

So many of you called me retarded and think that holding 100% diamond hand will do the job. It would have done the job if wall street didn't have the solution for it.

From 3k to 55k actually, graph is weird in revolut. Still riding some shares. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What the F is share lending? 🚀🚀🚀 I read several comments and posts across reddit talking about not lending your GME shares for shorting. But there seems to be a lot of misinformation or lack of understanding around this topic. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but only what it is. 

Most proper brokerages have share lending programs, which you have to sign up for and only then they can lend your shares for shorting. In return you get a part of borrowing fee, which differs based on short interest. These programs may have different but similar names in different brokerages such as fully paid security lending (ally) but are available in most brokers.

One of the biggest condition for the program is that security should be fully paid i.e. not on margin. Now we know most of retail shares of a particular popular stock are not on margin anymore. 

Brokers need to place a security cash deposit for you when borrowing your stocks since during lending you dont get SIPC protection on your stocks. 
~~A little conspiracy theory here, during a short squeeze brokers that have lent out shates would be killed for that security cash requirement. So that explains why they want to avoid squeeze.~~

Anyway, Is it possible that you have signed up for such a program without knowing? Yes, and that you can check by simply calling broker and asking about the program and telling to opt out of it.  You can also google "your brokerage" "share lending program" to find out what fancy name your brokerage has given, so you dont sound retard when calling them to opt out of it. 

One catch though- wsb favorite Robinhood doesnt have any such program, meaning they can and they will lend out your security without your permission and without sharing any borrowing fee/interest with you.

And btw those rocketships 🚀🚀🚀 in subject are to bring you to read this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 10k down but these 🙌 are 💎 reee _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB is literally being debated about at one of the largest dedate tournaments in the country. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question 1: Why is Biocryst (BCRX)'s Berotralstat not priced in at all!? This post comes directly from u/bio9999 .. If you are interested in some amazing DD - give him a follow. Also, we actually have our very own subreddit so please feel free to take a look there as well for all the DD you could ever want and need! r/bcrx 💎🚀

&#x200B;

First we are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks. The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track**status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that **98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment**.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/)

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market**based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. The **UK** is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave **early access to the drug on November 9th**. [https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:\~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow **R8** or **nickpd** on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. **Optime care** even lets patients get **direct-to-patient** prescriptions now ([https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks)). So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**! And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that \*\*its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,\*\*and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes "***ONLY***" **168%**... The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

he didn't sold at 420 and im sure glad he didn't because i believe they could have gone after him.

The Virginia legislature just legalized Marijuana for recreational use. If you aren't familiar with Virginia politics let me tell you: this is a big deal. Virginia legalizing could be the gateway for more conservative states.I think we could be looking at Federal legalization within the next four years, and probably sooner.

 Altria bought a 45% stake in Cronos, a marijuana technology company. There are few companies I can think of that are better positioned to profit from national legalization than Altria. 

ATM Calls expiring January 2022 are only 3.40. Calls expiring a year later are only a dollar more. I think if we saw an end to Federal prohibition during the next year, we could see Altria stock move up significantly. It's down 50% in the last couple years and could be poised for a big move.

# How does the EV Sector Exponential Growth help BB?

Well, the 2020 to 2022 is a period for gaining significant momentum in the Smart EV sector and which shall rapidly accelerate from 2023 to 2025. As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.

Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.

As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.

Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.

# How is BB coping up during the COVID?

The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company’s endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.

# What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

The Company is developing a concept system to integrate BlackBerry Spark capabilities, including AI and machine learning technologies, with BlackBerry QNX automotive solutions. Have to watch out for more information during the earnings calls.

# How was the Customers growth among BB products?

**QNX:**

QNX was acquired by BB in 2010, right from that moment, BB started its journey in Automotive industry. Initially, it has launched Infotainments and Telematic under QNX product category and it was deployed on leading car manufacturers. It started branching out and was able to offer more products under QNX. Now it is has aligned itself very well for the next gen EV cars.

Adoption of QNX products from 2016 to 2020:

* 2016 - 50 Million
* 2017 - 60 Million
* 2018 - 120 Million
* 2019 - 150 Million
* 2020 - 175 Million

As we see, the growth has been substantial, and we can expect it grow more as we see more cars from new manufacturers and from existing ones and also automotive driving platforms especially in EV sector. There are currently 1.4 billion cars approximately.  In 2018, approximately 4.2 million heavy commercial vehicles and just over 20 million light commercial vehicles were produced throughout the world.

It’s estimated to have at least 470 million cars by 2025.

Chen stated that there won't be much of the revenue growth from IVY until 2023.

>Under the terms of our agreement, BlackBerry will own all the commercial relationships with customers and will share revenues with AWS.  
>  
>The target is to be in the 2023 year’s auto model, with possibly potentially some professional services prior to it. While it is too early for us to provide a revenue outlook, we are confident that BlackBerry IVY addresses a very large market opportunity that will greatly increase our ASP.

**Cylance:**

It is part of the Blackberry Spark product under UES category

Typically, Cylance subscription period is 1 to 3 yrs. based on the deal’s BB made.

Leader in EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform) and they are able to catch with competitors in EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)

UEM Suite

UEM Suite was added to the Department of Defense Information Network Approved Products List (DoDIN APL). **BlackBerry is the only UEM vendor that has achieved this level of approval to date**. This achievement is based on the completion of cybersecurity and interoperability certifications. This approval will provide us better access and a more streamlined approval process. This should naturally lead to greater revenue opportunities going forward. The latest release of UEM has also recently achieved NIAP accreditation

**AtHoc:**

Zoom was one of the customers who is using AtHoc product, after we know what happened to the stock when street found out that it wasn't secure. In this way, Zoom can highly secure way to hold virtual meetings in this new work-from-anywhere environment.

# BB Revenue:

Check the Spreadsheet for the Revenue Sources.

[2021 Fiscal year](https://imgur.com/pFnGMId)

Note: Software and Services include these products IoT, QNX, BlackBerry Spark, AtHoc, Radar.

The revenue got impacted due to 2020 chaos especially on the QNX product side. According to the earning calls. There are still on track to maintain the gross margin over 70% and dollar net retention rate is above 90%.

As you see, the [gross margin](https://imgur.com/Qf6fp2n) has been consistent past few years and revenue is steadily increasing every year.

[Growth in Revenue from Products from 2019-2013](https://imgur.com/ODRyRZY)

Notes:

In 2019, due to restructuring, BB was unable to close deals, we should see +ve in 2020.

IoT: Comprised of QNX products, UEM, & Radar

Other: Handheld Devices and Service Access Fee (SAF)

Since BB was moving away from manufacturing of devices gradually, in 2020 most of it done by third party companies. That’s why we have negative growth under **Other.**

# Pricing for BB products

**QNX Pricing:**

As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.

Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.

Link: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/)

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.

This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.

We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the above spreadsheet you saw list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using

IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.

**Radar Pricing:**

Estimation in 2017:

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.

The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry’s channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.

Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.

**Cylance Pricing:**

Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.

Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance’s AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.

At present, the market share is below 1%.

**Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:**

**QNX:**

According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $42.7 billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)

Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$ 4.5 billion by 2026

And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)

**Endpoint Protection (Cylance):**

The global endpoint security market is expected to grow from 13.58 billion $ in 2020 to 19.24 billion $ in 2025 at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period.

[https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market).

Assuming the market share in endpoint increases to \~3%. It can be around 577 million

**Asset Management (Radar):**

Global asset tracking market will reach $36.3B by 2025, growing at 15% CAGR

We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It’s quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.

**Challenges:**

QNX:

Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.

There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.

IVY:

Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software’s.

Cylance:

Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.

The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.

Radar:

It’s barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).

In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.

Thanks to OP's and go give a read at these DD's too:

Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.

Positions: 400 shares @ 12 and 2 Jan 20 2023 SP 15. I plan to add more as I see the potential and growth in the newly introduced products.

Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, I'm merely a random person who loves BB and would like to see this company fly to new heigths. Cheers to everyone!!

Edit1: thanks u/melbogia, added the date which I missed earlier for the calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ this is what i get for having paper hands... 195 shares sold @ $54 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ATT chart, everyone who uses this technique knows how great opportunity it is, my target is 37.60. 9$ profit however it will take on average 3 months. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This is how I feel about the whole gme things... I feel like the diamond hand stuff is getting  crazy, if I were able to buy stock (I am under 18 and my parents can't be fucked to make me a Robinhood account) I would have bought gme at the beginning and sold as soon as I saw the price going down call me paper hands all you want, but isn't that the smart thing to do? I was watching the stock guy on twitch the other day and something in chat resonated with me, "paper hands have paper", am I just dumb and this is actually going back up? Or is it done because just looking at the charts it looks kinda dead to me tbh._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some Smoothbrain Real Talk for Everyone at WSB Okay dumb-dumbs since I'm seeing the gain porn and lecturing from long time members here's a story for you all idiots that I think might help.

I've never really invested in a portfolio. My whole life I was taught two things: **keep your money in safe, steady growth locations, have have multiple locations.** So, that's what I've done. I have a savings account, a Roth IRA, a retirement fund, and as of May 2020, a portfolio. I started real small, with $1000. That money quickly grew to about $1300 and I realized that I could make smart buying decisions based on the news and my friend's (who is a CFA) advice). He convinced me to invest in some tech stonks early on as well as some other endeavors that have paid out handsomely. Not much in terms of gross $$, but from a % growth standpoint the money was huge.

Over time I started putting money that would normally go into my savings into my portfolio because, well, it was growing so much faster. I had a lot of growth off of tech stock investments, and now I have my hands in some fairly lucrative pies. **I then learned about WSB in mid-January and saw everything that was going on with GME, et. al.** I was skeptical, so I watched the market for a while. I thought 'oh hey, this could be a fun gamble, let's play ball.' I bought 10 shares of BB at $10. As it blew up I prowled the posts and saw that while GME was at $50, AMC was only at $5, and the plan to squeeze was targeted at both of them. So I bought 60 shares of AMC @ $5. A few days later, specifically, on January 29th, my money had exploded so I said okay one more small buy. I tossed in for 1 share of GME at $320, three shares of KO$$ at 69. **One hour later RH restricted buying.**

I guess I should've just dumped everything right there but I loved the camaraderie that I saw here. Obviously, I knew that a reddit sub wasn't about to take down any major hedge funds, but I did see an opportunity to expose these assholes like in 2008. So I held. Then when GME started to fall, I bought another 4 shares at $85, and I tossed my remaining balance on AMC. Everything together we're looking at about $1,500 put toward this effort.

Obviously, the outlook isn't a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. And yet, I'm holding. Why? Why would I hold after admitting I made an objectively stupid series of buys? Answer: Because I can afford to, and because I like to gamble. It's fun to me. I'm not rich by any measure, but I'm smart enough to understand that this is a group of RETARDS who know very little about finances. So I wanted to have fun with it, and I decided to invest about 10% of my portfolio into this mess. That said, my portfolio only makes up about 10% of my total net worth, if even that much. **So, at best, I've invested 1% of my net worth into this "movement."**

The moral of my story should be clear:

# You're all idiots. I'm an idiot. This is DUMB.

But it's also fun. And you know what? If you put 80% of your life savings into buying GME at $350, you're a fucking dumbass. That is not, and has never been how money works. **These guys posting loss and gain porn on this site? There's what, two dozen of them? Out of 8,500,000?!** Come on, stop. You think you're going to outsmart a series of billionaires just because some guy who bought 50,000 shares of a dead stock in July said it might work one of these days? Stop it, get some help.

And to the "OG members" who think that they are just so smart for manipulating the market at a FRACTION of the efficiency, stealth, and organization that hedge fund operators do it EVERY DAY, I say you can lick my nutsack from the back. Cool, a couple hundred people got lucky and ya caught Melvin off guard for a week. But honestly, shame on you assholes for screaming "HOLD HOLD HOLD" when GME was tanking from 400 all the way down to 120. **People were watching their lives disintegrate because of a damn joke that they weren't in on from the gate.** Guess what, you're Melvin now. You fucked the little guy and got rich doing it. How's it feel?

**TLDR:** I'm holding forever because I like the stock, but if this is ruining your life, get out now. It's only going to get worse. Also, WSB is Melvin down, sit in that shit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just being humble and asking for some help Hey there WSB, I’m not going to pretend I know anything of anything on here. I’m pretty young just about 20. I’ve been getting some good income in the past couple weeks ( $500 a week which is a lot for me ). I live with my family and don’t really have any bills to pay. I know you guys have no obligation to give me any advice at all, but I really want to put a lot of money and time into the stock market and hopefully start to gain a good income and get out of my current family situation. I’m not asking on how to make millions overnight I know it takes time, if at all. Overall I’m just seeking some advice and help maybe even some stocks you think would be a good move? Sorry if this goes against guidelines I’m not very sure but I’m just trying to put in some more extra effort to have a nicer life. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are the Risk Departments doing right now? The recent run-up of GME from $4 -> $500 caught a bunch of people with their pants down, such as hedge funds, brokers, and market makers. The entire world was watching and NOBODY wants to be exposed to this type of event again.

I'm losing hope that this type of thing will happen again in the next 10 years.

**TL;DR - Why this won't happen again**

1. Every financial institution is now aware of this type of risk
2. They have every analyst working to mitigate this in the future
3. They are learning how to break the rules better

# What are the Risk departments doing right now?

**Background:** I was a Data Scientist in the Risk/Underwriting department of a finance company for 3 years (not on wallstreet, just a B2C company for small consumer loans).

&#x200B;

**1. They are getting their ass handed to them.**

Risk teams hate attention because it's always bad. This is their worst nightmare.

The CEO is asking why the fuck they didn't see this coming and warn them. And why a bunch of literally retarded autists on reddit knew about this before they did.

**2. They are dedicating 100% of their resources to making sure they see this type of thing coming.**

Every Analyst up to the PhD jerkoffs that thought they were going to be playing with deep neural networks are instead currently spending all of their time running queries and making plots in excel for every "what-if" scenario that the executives can think of.

They may have gotten fucked last month, but now they have TONS of data to train models and run scenarios with. They are going to be ready next time.

**3. They are learning what rules they can break.**

Things like Failure-to-Deliver and limiting buys on certain securities are now additional levers that they are learning how to pull and are currently building models for. They don't give a fuck if something is "illegal" or "unethical". Instead they have a simpler function to guide their decisions:

`E(Revenue) = E(Gains from doing illegal shit) - E(Legal fees and costs)`

If they make more money doing illegal shit than it costs, then they do it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Note:** I'm probably completely wrong and Hedge funds still might be exposed. Idk because I'm retarded and bought GME at $300 and never sold._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish! People were shocked to hear "over 100% of GME shares have been shorted" or "institutions own over 100% of GME shares."

**"How is that possible?"**

It's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.

Here's the simple case:

Andy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says "I like this stock and that's a fair price" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!

These numbers are, for the purposes of the market, "real" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That *may* cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.

**"But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?"**

They can't - it's important to understand that *you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.* Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has *not* loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp)

So in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.

**"This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?"**

NOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can *only* lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They *cannot* lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.

At first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.

Now, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \[current stock price\]x\[current interest price\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close... i.e. a squeeze.

(I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)

**"Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?"**

Yes, specifically his words were *"Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes."*

**"Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?"**

Yes.

1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.
2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.
3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).
4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.

edit: u/rozhasi says "Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers."

edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though *new* Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) *If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.*

edit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending **on by default**, but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on [scrive.com](https://scrive.com)) so I'm hesitant to share it, but more info can be found here:  [https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/](https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/) .

I know with the GME / AMC situation, both cocks and spirits are down right now. But hey, it's not about marrying a stock right ? It's about making money. So as we optimistically wait for that situation to resolve, I have a proposition. Call it a "meta" DD. I'll keep it short.

For the past 2 months, more knowledgeable people than me in this sub have been pleading, literally begging y'all to get in on the CRSR earnings play, coming up shortly. Here is a compiled list of some posts made by people with big cocks -

1. Everyone.
2. Their garderners.
3. Their grandmothers.
4. Their wife's boyfriend.

Now a lot of those posts are pussies who're buying stock (which is a weird phenomena I've noticed recently, all of a sudden all DD and YOLOs are people being stock, whatever happened to OTM weeklies lol - that was the shit I'm here for), but if you're not putting at least a 1000 or two into  **40c 2/19,**  or if you're truly retarded like me, which I'm guessing you are, **60c 2/19, hell yeah,** then what are you even doing ? 

Do you just hate money or what ? 

**tl ; dr**

CRSR's is gonna murder earnings. 

Safe play for the pussies - **40c 2/19 CRSR**

Retarded play for people like me - **60c 2/19 CRSR**

Make your own mind up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Overview of Current GME Situation: It's Just Getting Started *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions. I don't know jack shit about fuck. This is not financial advice. This analysis is not meant to influence, inspire, or inform you regarding your trades. This analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect. I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock’s activity. I own shares of GME.*

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/


The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. I don't know what the fuck 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.


GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less. 

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make. 

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the "squeeze."

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. "The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron."

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy the stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently "low" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B. 

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a retard like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to "cover," but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.

Hello Paper Hands,

I see your posts about how you can't hold out any longer. I'm not here to tell you what to do, only to share a personal story.

I invested heavily into low and mid range Jameis Winston rookie cards shortly after he was cut from the Buccs. Retarded right? Most people thought so and card shop owners audibly laughed at my requests for them. I had them trading me Prizm Winston cards for Low End Daniel Jones and Drew Lock rookies before the 2020 season began. Then he signed with the Saints and his card value had a small jump... I could have had paper hands and took my profit then and there, but I believed the value was higher than that, I LIKED THE STOCK then as much as I do now, so I held.

Cut forward to midseason 2020, Brees goes down and Winston is not named the starter. Do I panic? No, because I trust what I see, Winston is a better QB than Taysom Hill.

Cut forward again to the NFC Playoffs, cameras catch Brees telling Winston "This is your team now." His price starts to climb, but hesitently as nothing is yet official. I know the Saints are not going to draft a starting QB this year, and they are in no financial situation to make a play for one on the market. So I hold, because I know the value will be higher when he is offically named the starter and the 2021 season starts.

That's 2 years of holding. Not even a scratch on these DIAMOND HANDS. 

I can honestly say the most difficult hold of all was the first one, when he signed to the Saints. The chance to get out with a small profit was tempting. Although I knew it would be a long hold, once I made the decision there was no turning back, I knew the regret of knowing I was right and went against my gut was a longer hold. I'm still holding those rookie cards btw, gonna be for atleast a little while longer. 💎👐 Right up until I believe he's hit peak value... Then I'll cash in, and take your wife out somewhere nice for a change._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Margin Rates are Negotiable Based on how much ya'll like to YOLO, I assume many of you are trading on margin. Please know that margin rates aren't set in stone and are negotiable. I use TD as my brokerage. Last week I messaged them saying that I have offers from other brokerages at lower rates and asked what they could do. They lowered my rate by 2%. I wrote them back asking for even lower (we'll see what they say).

This will save all you diamond handed Apes some money while you hold.

Holding till it turns to dust or hits the moon 🚀💎🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There is a social media manipulation campaign going on surrounding certain commodities I've been following the Gamestop trend on here for the past couple of weeks and, much like other people, have started to notice a lot of strange posts about silver.

Digging into some of the account histories of those promoting silver, we find some interesting things:

[This link](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ieae/i_went_full_retard_and_bought_15_kilograms_of/) - a 3 year old account with 1 month of posting history, oldest visible post on a trading subreddit.

[This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gkzfeb3/) - an account which just started posting regularly 4 days ago and posted a hilariously easy to photoshop image as "proof" of holdings (with 17 awards).

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72m7j/when_should_we_go_all_in_on_silver/) - 10 month old account which mainly posted about MMA until 3 days ago, since then only posts have been about silver.

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70j2t/punish_the_banks_punish_the_hedges_buy_the_one/) - year old account with sporadic posting history....until 3 days ago when they started posting about silver.

[This - one of the most obviously astroturfed posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/) - a 9 month old account with two posts 8 months ago and every post since then (in the last 4 days) about silver.

Realistically, it would probably cost around $1500 to give that many awards to that post. $1500 is pocket change to firms like Citron which hold a big stake in silver.

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l723fs/guys_now_is_the_time_for_silver_it_is_currently/) - posted 3 days ago (noticing a pattern?) - 3 year old account, just became active again after about a year.

The list goes on from that obviously.

A good chunk of those accounts appear to be purchased accounts. The tell-tale sign is a huge gap in post history and way off topic posting. Anyone with a couple thousand dollars lying around could do it. For huge firms which already held millions of dollars in silver/silver securities, it's like pissing into the ocean. 

I just want everyone to be aware of what's happening._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Emotionally Intelligent Investor All I'm trying to tell you people  is you get laid if you said

 "Babes it was a crazy day, but i was emotional intelligent and held. "

Emotional Intelligence challenges several long-held assumptions and beliefs, by asserting that a good investment approach starts with introspection. Too many investment gurus tell you to emulate their techniques despite the fact that you may have very different personality traits, motivations and biases. Would Zion Williams tell a short basketball player to play like him? Investors need to create a unique template for self-reflection and a framework for developing an investment approach that works best with who you are. Whereas the consensus opinion is that investing success comes from blocking out emotions and making purely rational decisions, the best money managers actually use their feelings. They actively sense what others in the market are thinking, and they employ gut instincts when making decisions. Nevertheless, virtually all investing text books neglect to mention how to best cultivate and utilize empathetic and intuitive realizations. By creating your own investment template, you will develop an investing advantage by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. You will also discover how a stock chart is a great tool for understanding what the current holders of a security may be feeling, and you will appreciate why technical analysis works. Superior returns primarily depend on self-awareness, empathy and intuition._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey Hedge Funds... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short me! A tribute to WallStreetBets.

Had to repost because I forgot to edit out my account number (proof I am also a retard) bought the dips and sold the blips over the past 2 years. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gains were made, but the bag was dropped. I fell into the GME 👐🏼💎 cult and let her slip right out of my hands. Lucky I got in early enough to secure like 40k _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can we please see a repeat of 2 weeks ago?!?! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ all of us right now: _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Would like to write about my experience with the GameStop run up, and what I learned about life out of it Hey guys. 

I made a post roughly 60 days ago about a 30k “YOLO” on GME. I purchased the 25c 4/16 with roughly 77 contracts. My cost basis was about 5 dollars a contract since I bought before earnings. I diamond handed them through the rough days where we saw GME drop heavy after earnings.

Two nights before GME took off, I sold my position. I keep going back, and I keep asking myself. Why? Why did I sell? I was so confident this would play out. I Fucking went all in and sat on my position through all of the ups and downs. Truth is, I don’t know why I sold. I believe I was bored, and just wanted to trade something. I couldn’t stand not trading. 

When the run up began, I felt sick. I threw up, and my body wouldn’t stop shaking. Life changing money for me. I kept checking the value of the contracts that I had, every 15 minutes and counting all the money I would’ve had if I didn’t throw my contracts away.

I began shaking and crying. Hating myself for being such a paper handed bitch. So I went all in again on a GME weekly. I watched that weekly call double my original position, and then eventually ride to 0. That’s right. 

I blew up my account. I’ve only been trading options for less than a year but at the top of GMEs run my position would’ve been roughly 4mil.  

I’ve gone from 20k -> 60k -> 3k -> 20k -> 36k -> 0

Everyone including friends and family keep asking if I’ve heard about GME. Yeah bitch, I heard about it. It hurts to talk about. I tell my story, and they all tell me how sorry they feel for me when I tell them I could’ve been a multi millionaire.

Do you want to know why I don’t have millions right now? Because of these mother fucking paper hands. 

As I watch you retards gamble your life savings at the top of GME, diamond handing it to the bottom, I can’t help but to think that you guys are fucking retarded. 

You’re all retarded but you’re like me. You belong here, and I certainly belong here. 

As we speak, I’m pulling funds out of the retirement account and going back at it. 

Why? Is it because I’m a Retard? Maybe. But I’m a Retard with a dream, and that can be scary thing and I realize that.

Godspeed to you all.

Great Scott. Of course. The solution is right there in front of you, sandwiched between a sweating Jack In The Box cup and a broken iPad used to roll joints on. You’ll invest in weed stocks. Everyone likes weed and Joe Biden is going to legalize it soon! Look at that, you can buy weed stocks for CHEAP! $SNDL is barely more than a dollar share. With $80 you’re practically a majority shareholder!

You couldn’t be more wrong.

I could throw a bunch of complicated DD at you right now with charts and acronyms so we could both pretend we’re smart. But it really isn’t complicated. If weed stocks are going to surge due to legalization then someone explain why when weed is legalized in certain states the price of an ounce can plummet to $60? You’re talking about a commodity literally ANYONE can grow in their home. It’s as if climate scientists expect that rain will turn to beer within the month and you say “I’ll invest in Budweiser!”

I can feel you getting defensive and I understand. Won’t some company end up being the biggest out of them all and worth a lot of money? What about peripheral industries like Akerna? Wait, Screech died? When?

Over-saturation is going to be the biggest thing with legalized weed (See: $60 ounce). Supply side will be local or at largest, regional. If I’m in Seattle why am I ordering weed and paying shipping costs from North Carolina? Or even worse getting it from Canada with all the international trade headaches? There is literally nothing they can offer me that can’t be grown or produced locally. Nor is this like the wine industry where climate conditions can influence the product. I can grow this anywhere. Which also means there is still a massive black market for weed.

When I say black market I don’t mean guys with face scars meeting in empty airplane hangars to make deals. I mean your friend decided to throw some seeds in the ground, forgot about them and now has 4 pounds of weed he needs to get rid of. Being from a legal state I cannot tell you how much free weed I get from friends. It’s like when you think you’re cooking a reasonable amount of spaghetti and next thing you know you’re the gluttony scene in “Se7en”.

So what about peripheral businesses surrounding pot? I’ve seen a lot of talk about Akerna ($KERN) on here. Mostly people saying they’re the “only business of their kind in an emerging market”, etc. So have a look at their description on the website:

>Akerna consolidates cannabis technology companies to connect data points in the global cannabis supply chain. In doing so, Akerna creates one of the world’s most transparent and accountable consumer packaged goods supply chains on a global scale. We believe connected data and information will modernize and propel the cannabis industry by increasing the power of businesses, governments, patients, and consumers to make smart decisions.

This reads like an essay with a minimum word count.

Just because something is the only business of its kind isn’t a good reason it will succeed. Go find the cardboard box the guy who invented toe socks lives in and he’ll tell you. If my supply side is mostly local what the fuck am I going to do with the information Akerna provides? They are a cannabis software company. A cannabis software company. Keep saying it. A cannabis software company.

Silverlake dumped those 44 million shares between $13 to $16/share...smart move for them bad for AMC shares holders.  In that 8k AMC also said they would issue 50 million new shares, to be sold ...whenever. I'm seeing reports that they sold at least some of them in the $10+ range.  So the question i have is two fold:

1. I see all these people posting short interest %...how do they actually know if AMC can randomly sell new shares?

2. Why are people bullish on AMC with all of the dilution? They have sold new shares multiple times since October.  The price should be less than $2 if you just look at dilution.

Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Hi everyone, hope you're having a peaceful Saturday. The Super Bowl is coming up, so I hope you guys in America enjoy it.

This post is for AMC, as this is what I've been playing close attention to. After doing some of my own research, I've concluded that AMC isn't worth $1 as many analysts have mentioned in their analysis, and I think it should be much higher. It all comes down to the fundamentals of the film industry.

How film studios and distributors make money is primarily based on theatre attendances. Usually, a portion of profits made from theatre tickets goes to theatre owners. The majority of the rest goes to the studio and distributor. The amount is organised through a contract between the exhibitor and the studio before the film is aired; usually, it's a 60/40 split, with 60% of the ticket revenue going to the studio. You can read more about how movies make money here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp)

As long as this fundamental is in place, the film studios and distributors will keep airing their films in theatres and cinemas. Although streaming services are the future of entertainment, they won't be able to replicate the same big-screen experience that many do enjoy. Furthermore, they won't provide the same profit margins for film studios as a regular theatre would do. It all boils down to the streaming service business model.

A prime example of this is when Disney aired the live-action film Mulan on Disney+. You had to pay the $30 early-access fee on top of the regular $6.99 per month subscription to get into Disney+. Logically, there was a big backlash behind this move, with many calling it a "daylight robbery". This defeats the purpose of a streaming subscription business model; the whole point is that you pay a small fee per month to gain access to a large amount of content. Having a rental that costs more than a regular rental and even more than a regular ticket, is counterintuitive to the business model.

Now take the fundamentals of the film industry into account, and it doesn't add up. If the streaming platform sets a $20-30 fee on a film, no one pays to watch it. If they set no fees at all, then the film studio won't make their money back.

So, as long as this fundamental is in place, AMC will continue making money in the future. AMC has set up private theatre rentals, screening old classics and airing new films from 2021 into 2022. And as long as big film studios advertise people to watch their movies in theatres, AMC will go on.

Now that bankruptcy is off the table, and vaccinations are ramping up, we'll slowly return to normal. I can see the stock being back to $10-20 again.

**TL;DR:** As long as film studios advertise to go to the theatres, AMC won't go anywhere.

*Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Thanks for reading.

However, January/February is historically the slowest travel period of the year. Stock prices for airlines and hotel services are already low due to:

(COVID-19 travel restrictions) + (Low Travel Time of Year) = Low Share Price

***HOWEVER*** Please know that some airlines and hotel services took on A TON of debt that will take a long time to recover from. Others relied on large cash reserves to make it through the pandemic and took on minimal debt.

The ones that borrowed the least amount of money from the government over the pandemic will be the ones with the largest and quickest bounce back when this summer's travel season hits with lifted COVID travel restrictions and the urge for people to want to get out of the house.

Minimal debt will make it easier for these well-off travel companies to be able to meet the sudden increase in demand this summer and get themselves back to pre-covid financial stability relatively quick.

The ones that accrued a ton of loan-debt will be the ones that you won't see much gain from for *YEARS* as cash reserves are *slowly* built back up.

***The Main Point***: If you are interested in investing in travel companies during the current off-season of travel, ***DO YOUR RESEARCH*** to find the ones that have the strongest financial strong-hold when the travel season hits.

There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don’t see any companies that are focused on this.

There is an ETF $LIT. I’m not thrilled with it though.

So my thoughts lead me to EV battery material mining. With shortages this could be a good play but I’m not sure about long term potential.

And they're only allowed to earn the specific profit margins set for them by tax laws and min max price regulations.

This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

Listen up, I’m about to hand you undeserving miscreants a 5-bagger, maybe 10, just by buying and holding.

[Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/) ($RIDE), makers of the [Endurance](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance), the only EV truck with four independent, hub-mounted motors.

**The Company** 

Lordstown Motors is named after Lordstown, Ohio, site of a giant [mothballed GM factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/gms-lordstown-factory-goes-dark-as-automaker-closes-underused-plants.html). The factory spit out 16 million cars and trucks before being shut down two years ago. Car manufacturing was what Lordstown was built around, but people stopped buying sedans, and this factory only made the Chevy Cruze. You know anyone who drives a Cruze? Exactly. No one. That’s why they shut down.

But you know what people want? TRUCKS. You know what else people are buying? Electric vehicles. Too bad there are only those ridiculously ugly Cybertrucks that will someday, maybe, eventually, get built and sold at ridiculous prices. Too bad there’s only that hydrogen one that runs on MS Paint and vaporware. Too bad the other EVs are Chinese, so when you retards lick the windows, you get cancer.

Meanwhile, there are entire fleets of commercial vehicles looking for something to fill their needs. And you know who knows how to build all of that? A bunch of fucking unemployed people in Lordstown, Ohio! Enter RIDE. They made a deal with GM to buy the plant and get prototypes for fleet vehicles rolling off the line within a year. 

**The Truck**

My God, look at this beautiful beast. Look at those sexy headlamps. Look at those MFing solenoid coils in the wheel wells. Those taillights look like Cyclops and Geordi La Forge had an LED love child. Wanna touch it. Makes me hard.

75 MPGe. 7,000 lb towing capacity. 1.5 ton payload. 250 mile range. 109 kWh battery pack. Unnnggghh. Read it to me again, but slower. Aaahhh yeah.

Most important differentiator? The hub motors. They’re directly on the wheel, so there’s no transmission devices of any sort, so no wasted motion, no wasted energy. They’re designed specifically for the type of stop-start driving that fleet vehicles do. Think package delivery. And because they’re independent motors, they can individually deliver power, allowing true 4WD on muddy job sites, not the actually-its-just-2-axle design.

OK class, can anyone name a group of [aging delivery vehicles that might need to be replaced real soon](https://www.wired.com/story/biden-wants-government-run-evs-not-easy/)? Preferably from [an American manufacturer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/)? Can you say “[regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)”? I know you can!

Who’s making the parts, you ask? GM. RIDE has full access to the GM catalogue of parts, so the company can just copy and paste the behind-the-dashboard stuff with confidence that it’ll work, that suppliers will come through, that costs will be reasonable due to bulk production in other GM vehicles, and most importantly, that the company doesn’t need to pay for the R&D. It’s already been done. RIDE is reinventing the wheel, but the rest of the truck is taken care of. Like your wife, it’s got that label on the outside, but it’s really someone else’s junk in her.

Who’s making the batteries, though? Samsung. Nuff said. And the motors? [These guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbCuwC_UwE).

**The Money**

Cool truck. Fine. Whatever. Can’t eat a truck, only tendies. So look at the numbers. The truck will sell for between MSRP of $52500 and an actual price of $45,000. Let’s take the lesser. It costs, the company estimates, $42k today and $37k by 2024. The plant will ramp up from just a few thousand this year to 100,000 by 2024. From there, the plant can produce 600,000 trucks per year. Dayum! That’s a lot of product! Isn’t that way more than anyone could sell? 

No, retard. Look it up. The Ford F150 sells 900,000 trucks every year. The Silverado, about 600k. Nobody’s buying those boomer dinosaurs. 100k is nothing. It’s easy, especially when you’re the most badass EV truck available, and unlike the competitors, you actually exist in real life.

So let’s pencil in 100k trucks per year, sold at 45k and costing 37k. Let’s say it’s $130 million to run the G&A. That’s…$726k in profit by 2024, more every year after. Look, I understand most of you just want to SEC (middle word = Elon’s) all day long, so you don’t really understand the concept of profit yet, but trust me, it’s a good thing!

Right now the company has a market cap of $4 billion. It can make ¾ billion in a year. That’s a P/E of 5. What’s Ford’s PE right now? 10. If RIDE gets to the same PE (and it will go much higher because it’s not a boomer truck) it’ll double. If RIDE sells as well as the Silverado sells now, the PT is $222 at a minimum. That’s 10 times today’s price. In 5-6 years.

You’re welcome.

Rocket emoji._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Tale of Two Stocks It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.

Thanks to industrialization, large portions of the population were uprooted and were herded together in large centers. This new form of existence, with its mass psychology and social dependence on the fluctuation of markets and wages, produced an individual who was unstable, insecure, and suggestible. He was aware that his life depended on boards of directors and captains of industry, and he supposed, rightly or wrongly, that they were chiefly motivated by financial interests. He knew that, no matter how conscientiously he worked, he could still fall a victim at any moment to economic changes which were utterly beyond his control. And there was nothing else for him to rely on.

The captains of industry, most of them in the United States, chiefly motivated by financial interests, did indeed infect the entire planet with their greedy materialism. One concomitant of such materialism is the spiritual confusion of our modern world. Another has been the hollowing out of money, which in the near future will make all savings illusory. A third is the emptiness of Western materialistic values, which has led to the degeneration of the individual personality. 

Success doesn’t mean the gaining of wealth, position, or other advantage, implying things like advancement, upward mobility, getting or being rich, having power or status, achieving a prominent social position, or gaining acclaim or a respected reputation in one’s career. 

The new success is people taking up their individual responsibility, accepting the challenge of personal change, achieving transformation, turning problems into opportunities, moving into their own power, working with those less fortunate, developing visions to inspire and energize others, and challenging the status quo.

When the time is fulfilled a new orientation will irresistibly break through, a thing unheard-of before: the right man sitting in his house and thinking the right thought will be heard 100 miles away. Neither propaganda nor exhibitionist confessions are needed.

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the commission-free stock trading & investing apps are a pretty neat idea.

We know now that we know nothing and that is the highest degree of ape wisdom. I view my fellow human not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Everyone 💎 🤚 for $1000 and why we should be hoping for 3:1 x$100 instead Think about this. Bulls and bears squabbling back and forth. HF’s dealing with massive potential losses willing to potentially taking legally questionable actions. Retail investors losing big gains and getting tin foil hat sick. GME’s market cap roller coaster making company moves difficult to plan. 

If GME split shares 3:1, it could solve a lot of the problems for all sides. 

1. Retail investors. Let’s say you bought in at $300 and now we’re down to $60. If a split occurred, your share would turn to three valued at $20. Demand surges from HF’s to help cover their shorts as well as 📄 🤚/new retail investors sending the stock back to $100. Your one share losing $240 is now 3 shares worth your initial investment. Also allows people to average down. For those average share under $300 currently, gains. 

2. HF’s. If HF’s are short, they can grab a good chunk of shares to cover ~1/3 of their short position at a discount. The HF’s shorting at $400 currently would only need new shares to stay under $133 to cover. Stabilizes the beasts by their direct surge in buying the lower value shares to bring value up, positively impacting retail investors. Nothing will change some folk’s sentiment about HF’s, but it would be at least a more legal way for them to play their games while not borking the retail investor like they have been. 

3. GME. The roller coaster stock prices/market cap make planning for investments/pivots by the new leadership difficult to calculate. By splitting and seeing a surge to find a common ground, in this scenario, GME’s market cap would be $21B. A lot for a “failing” game store (HF thesis for shorting) and to pivot for massive company evolution (bull retail investors/“I like the stock” crowd). 

Ie. I have 100 shares. If it meme’d out and got to $1000 each, who’s to say the brokerages could universally (looking at you RH) pay out for people who dip out at $1000?  My 100 shares I bought close to the top ($300 for $30k) would then become 300 shares at $100, bringing me back even on investment but now in possession of a valuable asset I could choose to sell. GME has a stockpile of cash from these adjustments to make major moves in the market. If I hold my now recovered $30k, GME could go up based on new initiatives (especially after all this free publicity). If I don’t really love the stock, I can get out and get my money back. For those who averaged below $300 a share or hold shares from the before times, you end up with some pretty significant - and stable - gains with 3x as many shares in a company poised for a massive pivot. 

Not a pessimist, 💎 🤚 all the way. But, if I could triple my stake in a company I believe in and see my initial investment get back to close to even, watching GME have the capital to make some gigantic leaps at the expense of the HF’s fixing their mess by jacking up the new diluted share price, I wouldn’t exactly be mad. Plus new investors/people finally able to average down would see gains. That looks to me like 3 parties (current holders, GME and new retail investors) winning at the expense of HF’s fixing their garbage hands while jacking the price for shareholders._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Consider a pre-earnings LULU bet [LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/) is the place where all (basic) girls go to get their amazing $150 yoga pants (and other high-quality yet overpriced apparel) after getting their frappuccino at Starbucks!

Someone recently did [a great DD on LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klxhx6/lulu_to_the_moon_and_here_is_why/). I want to add a few things:

\- The stock price has been struggling in the past 3 months (down 5%) but has started an upward trend last week.

\- Q4 earnings coming out on 3/25, and given how busy the stores were during the holidays can bet it's going to be awesome.

\- Currently, the most popular (highest open interest) option for this stock (across all expiration dates and strikes) is 380C 3/19/2021, so it seems smart money is betting on a big move prior to the earnings (although it's possible these positions were opened mid last year when the stock price was higher.)

Do not sell if you see any of these things happen:

1. GME drops by 30% or more after hours
2. SEC filings show that shorts have all exited their positions
3. GME drops below $1 a share
4. The GameStop locations near you start closing
5. GME files for bankruptcy
6. GME is delisted from the stock exchange

*These are classic hedgefund tricks.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC update, holding through -$267k loss, bought options on the dip.💎🙌🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Catharsis For the majority of us, the money we won or lost wasnt going to be life changing (edit: unless you bet a mortgage, then that is the way 🚀🚀🚀). Otherwise, the average person on here probably wouldve just paid off rent for a year or two? Or two nice vacations from the potential earnings had they sold @ 450$. I quite frankly dont give a fuck about the 5 digit missed profits or unrealized losses, I can make it back in half a year tops if Im lazy. Technically, I didnt lose anything yet as I plan to hold my shares @ average of 40 to the grave or give them to my great great children but you get my point.

It wasnt my first degenerate gamble and the logic and maths were there. It was a once-in-a-lifetime play. What grinds my gears though was when momentum was totally cut off last week and shit started crashing when no one could buy. We were on track to soar but we didn't count on brokers taking a piss. It blows.

I'm OK losing money I was willing to gamble. I have no problem sinking with the ship at this point, but not in an unfair game. Imagine sitting at a blackjack table and the dealer busts just for him to take a card off and say 'Oh yeah, I changed the rules. I unbusted! Hooha!!' What I'm upset about is that they had to bend the rules to beat us. We were on track to hit 1000$ per share had RH and other fuck faces not halted all ability to buy GME. What ever happened to a free market and land of the free?

My second disappointment isnt with the system, its in myself. Many moons ago, I used to work 9$ an hour scanning pineapples and bananas as a kid. Soon after college I worked a construction job for 15$ an hour till I found a more stable job with my college degree. I bought my shares @ 40$, I couldve sold each for 200,300, or even 400 easy. What happened? I got greedy.  Lets be honest with ourselves, most of us did the same shit. Everytime I hit the refresh button I was printing 2K and imagined ruling the world from a yacht in the Hvar with my GME shares. I was too fucking high off benjamin franklins to sell each share for 5-10X what I bought them for that I phoned my broker and set each share at 10,000$. The kid that used to buy freezies from the 7/11 for 0,50$ and dove a 500$ rust bucket to and fro college was setting each share for 10,000$ a share cause his head was too far up his arse, somewhere on the outskirts of Andromeda.

TLDR: The squeeze hasnt squoze, holding till alpha centauri 🚀🚀🚀🚀 but let's take some time to do some gay reflection_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The "Gamma Squeeze" Explained: Gamma Theory for Monke Since GME's gamma squeeze 2 weeks ago, every monkey seems to think that GME is primed for another "gamma squeeze" every single day. Veteran WSBers almost certainly understand what a gamma squeeze is because a) It's not complicated b) Gamma was all the rage last March as SPY plunged into oblivion...but the 6M monkeys that have flooded into these sacred gates within the last 2 weeks seem to be pretty oblivious. So, I want to help spread some knowledge so our community isn't filled with fucking idiots. **I'm going to try to explain some basic gamma theory, diluted-down so even you peanut-brain baboons can understand.** *You do have to be literate to understand this, so maybe there is no hope for many of you.*

You need to have a basic understanding of *options greeks*, namely delta and gamma. I will briefly discuss them so we're all on the same page, but I'm not going in-depth because there are hundreds of posts in this sub explaining them in-depth, not to mention all the boring bullshit that gets posted in places like r/options.

EDIT: Putting this at the top since apparently many people are confused. **A "gamma squeeze" has absolutely nothing to do with a short squeeze**. Gamma squeezes are driven by large numbers of OTM option buying, whereas short squeezes have to do with short hedge funds buying back shares to cover their ass. *A short squeeze can happen without a gamma squeeze, and a gamma squeeze can happen without a short squeeze.*

DISCLAIMER: *I have no idea what I'm talking about. This has nothing to do with my career and I've learned all of this gamma shit from reading tons of shit online. This is not a lot things, and it's definitely not financial advice.  There are probably tens-of-thousands of people in this sub that know way more about this than me, so if I say something incorrect, I will happily edit this to reflect that.*

*If you understand basics options greeks, skip ahead.*

For the following, assume you paid $100 ($1.00 per share) to buy-to-open 1 call contract with strike price $10 (I'll refer to this as $10C). You are now "long" this $10C. If you sell an option, you are "short" it. Each option contract is worth 100 shares, so you multiply delta/gamma by 100 to get net delta/gamma.

* **Delta**: *For every $1 move in the underlying, your option's price/value will change by delta.*
   * For example: If your delta is 0.25 (or 25, same thing), then the value of your option will increase by $0.25 for each $1 the underlying increase. I.e. Stock goes from $5 to $6, then your $1.00/share call increases to $1.25/share, netting you a profit of $25. Stock goes from $5 to $4, then your call decreases to $0.75/share, netting you a loss of $25.
   * Long calls are positive (+) delta, short calls are negative (-) delta; long puts are (-) delta, short puts are (+) delta. Delta gets larger in magnitude as you go in-the-money (ITM) and smaller as you go out-of-the-money (OTM).
      * At-the-money options (ATM) have a delta of approximately 0.50. The delta of deep ITM options approaches 1.0 as you go further into the money. The delta of deep OTM options approaches 0.0 as you go further out of the money.
* **Gamma:** *For every $1 move in the underlying, your* ***delta*** *will change by* ***gamma.***
   * If you have taken any basic physics course, this will sound like **acceleration** to you...because it basically is. It's the 2nd order derivative of your option's value function.
   * If you have no idea what any of the above means, think about **gamma as the gas pedal in your wife's boyfriend's car**: when he floors the gas pedal, the car goes faster and faster, increasing in speed *exponentially*. Once the car starts moving, it starts picking up speed rapidly because of the acceleration, and you go flying into the back of the trunk as your wife gives her boyfriend a quick handie in the front seat.
   * Long options all have positive (+) gamma, regardless if they're a put or a call; **short options all have negative (-) gamma**. **Gamma is largest at-the-money** (ATM) and decreases as you move both ITM and OTM.
   * For example: Delta is 0.25, gamma is 0.05, underlying price is $7. As price goes from $7 to $8 (approaching your $10 strike), delta increases by gamma to 0.30 and gamma increases to 0.10. As price then goes from $8 to $9, delta increases to 0.40 and gamma increases to 0.15. As price increases from $9 to $10, delta increases to 0.55.

>***As gamma increases, delta grows exponentially***...and gamma increases because you are approaching the strike price. If that makes sense, then you basically understand how a gamma squeeze works.

Now before I explain what a gamma squeeze is, I need you to stop slobbering all over your keyboard- you're an ape, not a dog. Just because your wife's boyfriend disciplines you like a delinquent poodle doesn't make you one. You're a fucking ape, have some pride.

Okay anyway, I want to explain what **market makers** (**MMs**) are because most of you orangutans clearly don't understand them either.

**Market Makers**

>*When you buy an option, another degenerate isn't selling it to you- a market maker is*.

MMs are large banks/institutions that have special agreements with your broker (sometimes they are your broker) to go behind the scenes and fill trades, providing essential liquidity to the market so you can get fills on your faggy delights (FDs). MMs make money by A) getting paid by the broker to create liquidity B) Scraping margins on bid-ask spreads. That doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you're filling millions of spreads those pennies add up fast.

Since MMs will basically take any trade and *make money regardless of how the trade goes*, they want to **hedge the trade so their risk is essentially 0**. To do this, they try to be "**delta neutral**," meaning they want their net delta to be 0. If net delta is 0, when price goes up or down the value of the overall position/strategy doesn't change.

"*Hedging! I've heard a lot of people use that word when talking about gamma!*" is what you're probably thinking. Congrats, you chimpanzee, you're sort of starting to connect the dots.

**MM hedging is what creates gamma squeezes.**

>*How do MM's hedge options?*

Let's go back to that $10C you bought for $1.00/share (delta 0.25, gamma 0.05). A MM was on the other end of that transaction: they sold-to-open (or "wrote") the $10C for $100. Now the **MM is short a $10C**, so they have ***negative delta*** **and** ***negative gamma;*** their net delta is -25 and their net gamma is -5. They want to be delta neutral, so they buy 25 shares of the underlying (every long share has a delta of 1.0) and ~~wallah~~ (edit: I'm stupid) voila! -25 + 25 = 0.

*But, what happens when price increases?* You add gamma to delta. Your delta increases to +30, and the MM's options delta decreases (becomes more negative) to -30 (-25 + -5 = -30).

>*Because MM's have negative gamma, their delta gets larger in size*. ***Negative gamma creates gamma squeezes.***

*Uh oh,* now the MM's net delta is -5 (-30 from the short call, +25 from the long stock)...so they re-hedge by buying 5 more shares bringing their net delta back to 0. That share buying can push price up, leading to a vicious cycle of buying/re-hedging.

**The Gamma Squeeze**!

>Everytime MM's adjust their hedge by buying more shares, that can potentially **further increase the price.** This means delta will increase, and force MM's to **buy even more shares to re-re-hedge**.

*"Gamma" is in the name, so where does gamma come into play?* As the underlying approaches your strike  price, gamma increases in size. This means that delta increases exponentially. As a result, MM's increase the number of shares they buy each time: first 5 at a time, then 10, then 15 at a time. As price goes up, **MMs buy gamma** **to hedge their short call.** **As gamma gets larger, MMs hedge with more shares.** *Without gamma, the squeeze would fizzle out quickly.*

**The setup:**

>Gamma squeezes don't happen all the time. *You need the proper setup for a stock to get "gamma squeezed."* That setup involves **leverage** and **HUUUGE** (like the size of your wife's-boyfriend's-dong big) **AMOUNTS of deep OTM options**, two things every fucker here loves.

Let's say a stock is trading at $15. A few million idiots load up on cheap, deep OTM options at $30 and $50. These are stupid fucking options with deltas of basically 0, so MM's don't need to hedge them *initially*. In most cases, these will expire worthless. For whatever reason, the underlying's price starts picking up speed and starts approaching those strikes.

Now, all of a sudden **those worthless calls have a non-zero delta, and that delta is rapidly increasing by a further-increasing gamma.** All of a sudden, MM's start buying a bunch of shares to hedge and the *rate at which they buy is increasing with gamma*. This is all exacerbated by the fact that these FD's were so dirt cheap that **tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of contracts were purchased** by fucking brainlets.

So let's revisit 2 Friday's ago, January 22nd. GME opened around $40. The most OTM call strike was $60C with an open interest of 35k to start the day. By the end of the day, the volume at that strike was **180,000**. We can't always assume those are all buying-to-open, but looking back I think it's safe to say most of them were probably buying-to-open. Those options were **dirt cheap** at the start of the day because their delta was basically 0. By the end of the day, GME closed around $65 and all those $60C expired ITM, meaning a delta of 1.0.

>**MM's actively hedge during the day as price moves**, so that means they had to keep buying shares as price moved closer and closer to $60. Because of this, **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.

Again, you can't assume that all 180,000 $60C contracts were bought-to-open, but let's be reasonable and say 100,000 were bought-to-open. *That's the equivalent of 10 million shares that were purchased by MM's during the day to hedge their short calls* (total volume for that day was 200M) *- and that's just for the $60C alone*. Thus, this was a textbook gamma squeeze that inevitably helped drive GME's 50% increase in price that day.

**Will the GME Gamma Squeeze repeat:**

>Now that you hopefully understand the basics of a gamma squeeze, I want to re-emphasize one point: *YOU NEED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEEP OTM CALLS FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE.*

Why did we get a gamma squeeze on January 22nd? Because the $60C were **dirt-fucking-cheap** so degenerates could **leverage themselves to the tits with calls.** Thousands of calls could be bought for pennies - these calls are worthless until they're suddenly not, forcing MMs to rapidly hedge and yielding *the glorious gamma squeeze.*

What's different now? Implied volatility (IV) has been record-settingly high on GME options for the past week. Like 700-900%...values that were pretty much unthinkable until this event. That insane IV leads to options prices that get JACKED UP multiple times what they were before, especially at deep OTM strikes.

>***So those deep OTM options that fueled the first gamma squeeze are now multiple times more expensive, which leads to significantly decreased purchasing and thus cripples the prospects for a gamma squeeze.***

Are MM's inflating prices intentionally to prevent a squeeze? Sort of- it's rising IV that's raising the price, but that works in their favor because it stifles the chances of a gamma squeeze.

**Parting Thoughts**

1. A gamma squeeze almost undoubtedly contributed to GME's rise, but I think whales took over after the initial squeeze and kept pumping the price. Maybe some shorts covered somewhere in there too. I honestly have no idea, which is why I'm not touching GME - although I am rooting for you monkeys to become bajillionaires.
2. In my opinion, **GME is not currently setup for an upwards gamma squeeze because there is not enough deep OTM call buying.** When you compare recent volume with what happened 2 weeks ago, it becomes obvious we're no where near setup for a call gamma squeeze
3. HOWEVER; as IV continues to decrease, that will make OTM call options cheaper again. **I am not recommending you buy those deep OTM short-term call options because chances are they will expire worthless**. With that said, that kind of ape-strength-fueled OTM call buying is what fueled the first squeeze...and it can certainly happen again. Although I'm not betting on it.

**Some important notes**

* **MMs hedge constantly throughout the day** as delta/gamma change. The idea that options expiring ITM or OTM will lead to a gamma squeeze after hours is ridiculous because MMs are actively hedging into close. If your long call expires ITM, the MM is already long the 100 shares by market close. This is why **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.
   * The exceptions are when ATM options expire with non-zero deltas at expiration. In those cases, there is stock tied to those options at expiration and that stock will most likely be unwound in afterhours. This is probably not what happened with GME.
* Gamma squeezes can go **up or down**. Many of you seem to think that gamma squeezes only go up, but this is just wrong. **Squeezes follow the negative gamma** (MMs have negative gamma when you buy an option). If there's a lot of deep OTM call buying, that sets up for an upwards gamma squeeze; if there's a lot of deep OTM PUT buying, that sets up for a downwards gamma squeeze.
   * Right now, GME put buying heavily outweighs calls so, if anything, we're setup to squeeze lower.
* When there is **net option buying** (be it puts or calls) that creates **negative gamma** (the MMs) **which fuels volatility** and exacerbates price movements.
* When there is **net option SELLING**, that creates **positive gamma** **which suppresses volatility** and favors mean reversion to the largest gamma strike.
   * I'm of the belief that positive gamma creates a lot of support for SPY, and I use it to guide my SPY positions. It's worked out well for me, so that's why I use it.
* **Seriously, don't buy deep OTM short-term options**. 99 times out of 100 you're throwing your money away (that's why the delta is basically 0).
* There is a lot more nuance to this, such as options expiration, IV, long/short positions, and other things that are too complicated to discuss in one post. I've tried to simplify things, and hopefully I didn't make any mistakes in the process. When you consider that MMs are short some options and long others, it makes things more complicated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street look ahead for the trading week beginning February 8th, 2021 Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here at r/wallstreetbets.

# **Fiscal stimulus prospects and strong earnings tailwind may propel stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/fiscal-stimulus-prospects-and-strong-earnings-tailwind-may-propel-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the week ahead with a tailwind, as investors focus on a hefty fiscal stimulus package and the solid earnings season against a backdrop of rising interest rates.
*****
> There are several dozen S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Cisco and The Walt Disney Co. On the data front, there are just a few reports in the coming week, but the consumer price index inflation report is the important one to watch when it is released Wednesday.
*****
> Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell speaks mid-week at a webinar hosted by the Economics Club of New York.
*****
> Stocks surged in the past week, with the S&P 500 jumping 4.65% to a new record high, in its best week since November. The S&P 500 closed Friday at 3,886.
*****
> The hyper-activity around short-squeeze names, like GameStop, receded in the past week. Market chatter turned to rising interest rates, the steepening yield curve and market expectations for inflation.
*****
> “Rates are actually going up as really an expression of the potential that economic activity is likely to start accelerating, and we’ll likely see some inflation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> Hogan said investors will stay most focused on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which Democrats are pushing forward. If it is signed into law at its current size, the total federal spending due to the pandemic would be $5.3 trillion, according to Cowen, an investment bank.
*****
> “I think the path of least resistance has resumed to a higher level. I think we had a mini correction a week ago and I think it happened pretty quickly,” said Hogan of National Securities.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher and the only bumps in the road that I can see are a delay in fiscal stimulus or some exogenous factor come in and changes the dynamics,” he added.
*****
> The market is also depending on continued improvement in new virus cases, said Hogan.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The prospect of more spending and an improving economy drove Treasury yields higher in the past week.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% late Friday, after edging to 1.18% earlier in the day, near its recent high of 1.19%.
*****
> The 10-year is the most closely watched, as it influences the rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans. Yields rise as the price of bonds decline.
*****
> Market pros have also been watching another bond market metric: the yield curve.
*****
> It is the spread between the yield on a short-term Treasury, like the 2-year note, and a longer duration Treasury, like the 10-year. In that case, the spread widened to reach 1.06% over the course of the week.
*****
> That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2017. A steeper curve — which is what we’re seeing today — is viewed as a sign of an improving economy.
*****
> Strategists say the move higher in Treasury yields so far is not detrimental to stocks, but instead is a reflection of the economic bounce that could come from the stimulus package.
*****
> Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the steepening curve is good for the stock market, creating a tailwind for his “epicenter” trade in stocks that will benefit from an improving post-Covid economy.
*****
> His preferred sectors are the cyclicals — including industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, energy and financials.
*****
> Lee said the selling by hedge funds after short squeezes in a number of stocks and the record decline in the VIX, the volatility index, has led him to change his view on the stock market. He previously expected a sell-off in the first half of the year.
*****
> Now, Lee sees a “high probability that the first half 2021 correction is over.” The VIX, which is based on puts and calls in the S&P 500, started the week over 33 and fell to 20.87 when the market closed on Friday. A low VIX signals lowered expectations for market volatility.
*****
> The sectors that did well in the past week were mostly the ones that will do better in a financial rebound, or in a higher rate environment. Financials were 6.6% higher in the past week as big banks rose along with the yield curve. Higher long-term interest rates are a positive for bank profits.
*****
> The industrial group rose 4.9%, and materials were up 3.9%. Energy, lifted by a jump in oil prices, gained 8.3%. Tech recovered some ground, gaining 4.9%.
*****
> Sectors that do not do particularly well with rising rates, were up less, including utilities, up 2.3%, and real estate investment trusts, up 3%.
*****
> “It’s really about having an economic boom, allowing policy to support that boom,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “That’s the key driver of why the curve is steepening.”
*****
> Some strategists say the curve is also steepening because of the U.S. will be issuing a lot of debt to pay for the trillions in fiscal stimulus, and that would cause interest rates to rise.
*****
> That has also triggered concerns about increasing inflation. While economists do not expect inflation to spike, they do see the potential, for the first time in years, for inflation to move meaningfully above 2%.
*****
> Markets will also be monitoring the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which begins Feb. 9.
*****
> “It will get a lot of attention. Do the markets care? Maybe not, but everyone will be paying attention,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

> # Post-Election Februarys Have Been Even More Troublesome

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a3e19a00cddddb7704cdd8a753391f6e/21a0af750a31c87e-f0/s500x750/12edd49a31c1cf7460cb21815b25d793853b7db8.jpg))**

> From yesterday’s post, we knew February has a tepid recent record. In post-election years, February’s historically record has been even worse as historical average losses swell. In order to include as much data as we have available, we are using DJIA data since 1901, S&P 500 since 1930, NASDAQ from 1971 and Russell 1000& 2000 data beginning in 1979. When comparing post-election year February to the recent 21-year February seasonal pattern, the overall shape and trend does not change greatly however, weakness becomes more prevalent as the mid-month surge is less pronounced and second half declines expand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3c9c5cb8cb9d933fd2d96b686791066c/21a0af750a31c87e-1e/s500x750/26d3402fd26a76aa62cc8617497bd3095256cb33.jpg))**

> Breaking down historical performance by year confirms frequent post-election-year February losses, most notably by NASDAQ and DJIA. Generally speaking, when February is positive it is an “ok” month, but when the month has been down, it has frequently been down by sizable amounts. There are seven double-digit losses in the table and not a single double-digit gain.

*****

> # Typical February Trading: Lackluster Over Last 21 Years

> February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly –0.04%. Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.6% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like yesterday, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities over the last 21 years. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been somewhat disappointing for bulls.

> # As Goes January, So Goes The Year

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?

> There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.7% on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.

> “A weak January could foretell of rough times ahead in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is lately the trend has been broken, as stocks have done quite well after a weak January.” In fact, 8 of the past 9 times January saw stocks lower the final 11 months finished higher.

> # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?

> Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to “lose less” rather than “earn slightly more” than the value of the loan extended.

> The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the U.S.

> However, negative yielding debt does affect U.S. investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn 0.37% after hedging costs, compared with the -0.45% current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for U.S. debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and dampen the outlook for fixed income investors.

> What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of 1.25–1.75%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA for "diamond-handed apes" "It's not a loss until you sell"

Guess what?  You can never gain unless you sell either. 

Trading is fundamentally easy:
1 Buy low
2 Sell high
3 Repeat

You broke rule one or two (maybe both), now you're holding a bag, and trying to find a greater fool to take it off your hands at more than $450.

Here's some tough love: You won't find one. 

You can run with the herd, but when it changes direction and runs the other way, be prepared to change your mind.

There's no rule that says you have to make your money back on the same company you lost it on.

Next steps if you actually want to be a trader:
Cut your losses. Lick your wounds. Learn a lesson from all this. Commit yourself to actually learning your craft. Recapitalize. Put on your big-boy pants. Get back in the game._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Village Farms (Aka $VFF aka $🍅) DD; One of the best Cannabis 2021 plays available. **TLDR poem;**

🚀's are red

🍅's are red

🚀🍅🚀

🍅's 🌈🐻's soon to be 💀

*(Real TLDR's at bottom)*

***”Why the !@&amp;? would I want that 🍅 growing stock?"***

Yo, brother, calm down that anger.

I'm not providing investment advice so stop right here if you like.

We're just having a casual conversation about a bunch of things on a stock [I'm personally YOLOing 65k on](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lddvy7/vff_getting_ready_for_its_next_take_off/). (Aka my positions, no ban!)

If you're unaware though, this 30 year produce (🍅) growing company has been utilizing their decades of experience to grow Cannabis with stellar results so far and with 2021 looking to be really good for them.

Specifically, this will be on show these first two quarters of the year.

An important side note is that as of November 2nd, they now privately own the full 100% of Pure Sunfarms, their Cannabis subsidiary.

***"Oh I should get in NOW, huh? I see that $***🍅 ***ran recently, why would it keep running?"***

Great question brother! Of course, that's up to you! But...

$🍅 actually has multiple aspects as to why this has a very likely chance to run, then stay at a price that is probably higher than you would think "reasonable," and then still have more runs throughout the year.

First way to try and back this up, is pointing out that this low float stock of only 77,820,000 shares has a CEO that owns 12% of the stock himself, and a total of 13.6% owned by the Management and Board.

On top of that, another +12% of the float is held by institutional holders for an immediate 25% of this already low float stock off the table.

More on the float in a moment, but with that quick knowledge we next just need to take a quick peek at how $🍅's main competition's Share Price (SP), Share Count and Market Caps (MC) compare.

AFTER EACH COMPANIES **MARKET CAP (MC)** IS HOW MUCH EACH COMPANIES **SHARE PRICE (SP)** CAN GROW PER MARKET CAP GAIN OF $1 BILLION.

*As of close on February 5th:*

*Canopy Growth*: SP - $42.93 - 373,730,000 Shares

- $*16,044,228,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.68 per $1B MC

*Cronos Group*: SP - $12.01 - 356,190.000 Shares

- $*4,277,842,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.81 per $1B MC

*Aphria*: SP - $16.67 - 312,570,000 Shares

- $*5,210,542,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $3.20 per $1B MC

*Tilray*: SP - $25.72 - 148,260,000 Shares

- $*4,070,447,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $6.32 per $1B MC

*Aurora*: SP - $12.88 - "183,660,000 Shares"

- $*2,365,541,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $5.44 per $1B MC

$🍅*/Village Farms*: SP - $15.09 - 77,820,000

- $*1,174,304,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $12.85 per $1B MC

So, not only are they way behind in Market Cap, *even to Aurora*, but the amount that $🍅 can gain in Share Price to get there is unmatched.

I'm not saying the other companies should go down...

I'm just sayin... look at this...

VFF - $2,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $25.70

VFF - $3,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $38.55

VFF - $4,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $51.40

VFF - $16,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $205.60

***”So what? They are THAT much behind the competition."***

Hey, I get it brother, we've only talked only about superficial stock related info so far. 

Just setting the base in understanding it's growth potential based on their industry competitiors.

We're getting there, I promise!

Just one more thing about $🍅's current positioning though, which factors in a bit of a short squeeze.

Now, don't get it twisted, this is not a post about some one-time short squeeze, just a brief mention.

Just, *in this moment*, it so happens the timing could cause a little extra pop for this incoming next fundamental and technical run that will establish $🍅's new base level.

[Check it out, from 1/22 - 2/2 an average of 50% of the daily volume was short](https://fintel.io/ss/us/vff). Averaging about 25% of volume going short daily on either side of it as well.

This heavy shorting came at the heals of a recent company action that caused quick downward pressure on the Share Price and in turn gave *greedy* 🍅🌈🐻's ability to try and push it down unreasonably.

Did you notice the most recent closing price is $15.09 on Feb 5th?

You might not have noticed though, that on January 14th, $🍅 had a mini run and peaked at $15.05.

The next day, on January 15th, $🍅 dropped for a close of $12.65.

Closing above that previous mile stone means every short since the raise is now underwater. Just sayin'.

***”What happened that caused that drop?"***

Good things happened, brother. Good things. And... *they got shorted for it*...?

$🍅 announced a direct share offering that injected US$135Million cash to the bank @ $12.60, giving shorters a bit of strength over the last two weeks of January.

This semi large difference between the offering and Share Price at the time is indicative of something very important about this raise.

This was a planned raise that had nothing to do with the run $🍅 was going on *IMO*.

*IMO*, don't mistake this raise, *that closed on U.S. Inauguration Day*, as anything other than preparation for growth and expansion. They are already executing profitably, they in no way needed this for normal functions.

You have to understand, our ol' 🍅 is extremely diligent and resourceful in their approach to Cannabis so far, and will continue to going forward.

Their lack of splash is probably why you likely haven't heard or considered them yet, but the precise and profitable execution is why you should do DD on them.

Oh, by the way...

$🍅 has some of the best positioning and assets for the now inevitable U.S. legalization of Cannabis.

***”How is this Canadian LP, $***🍅 ***, any better set for the U.S. market than their competition?"***

Again, stellar question's brother.

And, again, multiple factors to this.

Our first factor is a direct shout out to that $135M raise.

Quoting the 🍅 CEO from their most recent earnings report conference call and in reference to potential U.S. strategies, "...*we're prepared to look at, if we have to do acquisitions or strategic partnerships and other locations*..."

That $135M putting them +$200M in bank is taking a certain type of vision, to me.

***”What, I'm suppose to believe your opinion that they have U.S. potential from a quote and your speculation?"***

Naw brother, you're suppose to understand that *fact* because they already have 5.7 Million SqFt of "Hemp" grow space ready to go in Texas.

Speculation and understanding how this company functions is part of my YOLO call strikes though.

A heads up, Cannabis uses the same growing system and could "*be rapidly converted to cannabis production*" the moment ready. - 🍅 CEO

Even beside the U.S. Blue Wave that will have some type of effect on Cannabis, Texas has put forth multiple pieces of legislation up for up for debate on it's own.

With, or without my personal speculation on their raise, their Texas assets are shaping up to be extremely valuable for them in the likely near-term future.

Icing on the cake of it all is simply that they are in no rush at all for when it happens.

They're currently profitable, and growing from their Canadian and other international positions as well, so U.S. legalization is simply a massive bonus whenever it happens, not a necessity.

*Like for some unnamed others...*

***”Yeah, so what? That still doesn't say WHY $***🍅 ***would keep running outside of hype."***

Hey, absolutely that's fact.  *So far.*

Now that we understand their comparative surroundings and asset ready U.S potential, let's bring in some internal 🍅 Cannabis biz facts.

Here are a couple of the most recent earnings, Q3's, Cannabis specific highlights:

*75% increase in Net Sales*

*81% increase in Gross Profits*

Impressive as that is, it's important to understand this is not some one-off fluke, but the first point in the provable continuation of their launching point for growth, which was Q3's the prior quarter, Quarter 2 2020.

I say launching point because of the execution of strategy over the last year and they have a lot of factors on why they will continue to see growth in their numbers.

The key to understanding the earnings and $🍅 share price growth potential is in the timeline details of their release approach for new strains, products, product segments, and accessibility.

***”What, a few random new products is you're point?"***

Well, it's a part of the main reason on *timing* of the moments before earnings, yes.

Because brother, it's not just *any* new products, but specific new segments of products that are brand new pies of profitability to eat from for extra growth potential generally...

...*and also how they set up their earnings reports for "surprise" growth effects with a specific style of WHEN they release their new products.*

This upcoming Quarter 4 Year End 2020 report with be the first quarter to have their 2.0 products available for a FULL quarter. Our feature earnings growth products for Q4 are Vapes and Oils.

Being released mid-September, the very end of Q3, that Q3 report got a nice C$1Million boost in Net Sales from the roll out and because of the timing of release Q4 will see an exponential effect of growth from that segment due to that timeline of release.

Similarly, Quarter 1 2021, aka right now, will have TWO additional new segment effects!

On December 21st, just before the end of Q4, they started offering their products for Medical for the first time through a deal with Shoppers Drug Mart.

An important key to this Medical deal is this is their first entry into Quebec, the last 30% of Canada they need. 🍅's brand was also the first brand to offer anything in the Ounce size for the Shoppers consumers.

Seeing the ~1 week effect medical might be interesting!...

to me....

Our other brand new segment that is now fully rolled out is edibles!

Earlier in January, 🍅 announced a deal with White Rabbit, an edible company with a vegan, gluten-free craft gummy company with a manufacturing process call EAT ME. 

With this, 🍅 has started offering White Rabbit products as of about mid January.

By establishing this parternship, 🍅 now has access to that process and as of February 5th now released their own branded edibles as well.

Pretty forward thinking and sustainable to ensure to grab a good tasting vegan and gluten-free craft gummy.

This win-win situation means no messing with growing pains, straight to the bottom line move. Love it.

***”Again, so what? Wha.."***

Don't mean to be rude, but I *wasn't* done yet...

Both the upcoming Q4 and Q1 have additional bonus growth factors!

For Quarter 4, first week of October, aka first week of Quarter 4, saw the release of their newest higher THC and higher priced Pink Kush and D.Bubba strains were release in their large 14g and 28g formats.

When these strains released for the 7g and less formats on a similar timeline fashion, the small format sizes saw an increase of 33% on Net Sales over the Volume sold.

Like I said, simply bonus growth factors from the decades old 🍅 company that understands the importance of showing growth Quarter over Quarter in a flooded industry with such tremendous potential.

For Quarter 1, early January also saw the release of their High THC vapes in addition to their current offerings.

***”Bro, are you done yet?"**

Okay okay jeez, I get it.

*There's still just like one-ish more things though...*

On a very quick view of some Marco-level elements, many provinces had extra legal red tape on providing licenses with Ontario being one of them.

Ontario also just so happens to be 🍅's biggest customer, and had also been known for being a province with the least amount of stores for the amount of population they have.

In August 2020, they upped the number of store licenses they were issuing from 20 to 40 per month, just in time for Q4...

In December 2020, they doubled it again to 80 licenses a month, just in time for Q1...

To put a little perspective on that, by the end of the most recently reported quarter, Q3 2020, about 190 licenses were issued.

By Q3 2021, approximately 1,070 licenses will have been issued. 

Generally, about ~90% of the licensees have their stores up and running each time Ontario reports its updates. That's a lot more stores brother.

This matters because we also know the 🍅's brand is increasing in popularity for Ontario as well.

After being +13% of the OCS's volume from October 2019 to October 2020, October 2020 specificallywas 15% of the dried flower volume going 🍅 brand. Aka increasing in popularity.

On top of that, we were also told their brand new segment, vapes, was about *top ~3 ish* for Quarter 4 in the OCS as of November.

***”This still doesn't really explain why they will grow... does it?"***

Look brother, it's a Reddit post that's already too long but I believe I've shown a lot of 🍅 positive factors to add on top of what was already going to see growth by itself.

The Cannabis industry is hot right now you guys.

Beyond retail, their Wholesale segment experienced a +140% surge in volume and sales in Q3 as well, with indicators that Q4 will continue steady growth in that cornerstone of additional revenue.

Being the cheapest producer in the game will continue to have it's benefits. If you think it's Aphria, you are incorrect. Aphria is solid, but the 🍅 beats them out pretty easily. 

Aphria Market Cap is also $5B to 🍅's $1B...

When it comes down to it, this Quarter 4 earnings report needs to speak for itself. I have my own personal opinion on what it might look like. Do your own research for your own opinion, brother.

Finally, just so you're in-the-know, my last notes are some recent analyst price targets for $🍅

Global Alliance - $20

Roth Capital - $22

Raymond James - $26

Beacon 1-year target - $35

Some supposedly big German Stock magazine - $30

Random people on Twitter - $+20

**Well, fun conversation brother!**

**Don't forget, this was in zero ways financial advice, but if you wanted more not intended to be the basis of any investment decision $**🍅 **related information, or wanted to try and argue some point you think I jumped to,** [I wrote a very deep dive VFF analysis with Q4 prediction](https://justwantgainz.bobson.com/p/reddvffdd) **potentially worth checking out first (+40% Gross Sales and +60% Gross Profit conservatively predicted).**

**TLDR;**

1 ) Comparatively, Village Farms (🍅)'s Market Cap is 1/16 of Canopy, 1/4 of Cronos, 1/5 of Aphria, 1/4 of Tilray, and 1/2 of Auroras.

2 ) Being a low float stock with 25% institutional holders and massive recent shorting that is now underwater will likely cause an extra short squeeze on top of the incoming technical/fundamental run.

3 ) 5.7 Million Sq Ft of grow space in Texas ready for quick and immediate Hemp to Cannabis conversation at the drop of any U.S. Legislation. Also, $🍅 cashed up for acquisition potential.

4 ) Release time line for Vapes, Oils, High THC Large Format Offerings, Medical (with Quebec), High THC Vapes, 3rd Party Gummies and 1st Party Gummies will all have debut showings on these upcoming Quarter 4 2020, Quarter 1 2021 and Quarter 2 2021 earnings reports.

5 ) Massively increasing store number from 🍅's best consumer, continued best-in-industry grow process for continued Wholesale strength, increasing quality and popularity of their products show positive trends of growth from their current segments as well as all the new ones.

6 ) Scroll up a smidge to check some analyst price targets.

**Still TLDR; $VFF = $**🍅 **= a stock that I like =** 🚀🍅🚀 **= opinion =** 🌙

PS: In case you didn't check my positions link near the top, I have 3k shares and 85 call contracts. I'm likely near to never going to sell my 3k shares @ $6.21, but I will be flipping my Feb and March calls at the end of this next run. Doubt I'll touch my June or 2022 calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The good news about your GME story WSB has a huge number of new users, many of whom are first-time bagholders as well. I think we should welcome the new users with open arms. Hi. Welcome.

I'm going to talk about the past few weeks and where things could go from here.

&#x200B;

**THE PAST**

In my opinion, no matter what happens going forward, GME was a total success. It was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence and retail traders made it happen—that's amazing. It's now an international story. Incredible. I know it's still developing and I'm not informed enough to comment on specific outcomes here, but I think it's awesome. It happened, in large measure, because of the awesome due diligence written by some of the hyper-smart retards of this sub.

A big part of the story is DFV. I caught on to [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) pretty late, only a few months ago when his account broke $2M. I was astonished at his conviction, and hypnotized by the prismatic, dancing light refracting through his diamond fucking dick. Right now, even if GME drops back to $20 tomorrow, he will be worth something like $15M (he's sitting on $13.8M cash). That's... I don't even have a word for how cool it is. His red headband and aviators belong in the Smithsonian.

Some folks made a ton of money on GME, and some are bagholding a fat loss. That's OK. Even the best traders have losses. And it may prove to be super valuable to some of you, because that heavy bag you're holding has a voucher tucked into the side pocket. Yep, right there... no no, outside pocket—yes. See it? That voucher holds a tremendous opportunity:

**It's the opportunity to stop being a dumbass**. ***But how?***

&#x200B;

I'm gonna briefly diverge here to talk about my WSB story. I joined summer of 2020, knowing nothing, but was drawn in by these insane GAIN posts that kept popping up on my feed. I didn't know what a fucking call or put was—shit, *I didn't even know how to buy a share of a stock*. But I lurked, and obsessed, and kinda started to figure things out, little by little.

Then came Purple (PRPL). I read the extensive DD, I followed the stock price movement closely, I even followed the CEO on Twitter (he doesn't tweet much). I looked into the play as much as I knew how, and when I pulled the trigger *I was so confident*. I sunk $3.5k into debit spreads (something you too can learn!), which was more than I was comfortable losing. But I was confident—they were going to crush earnings so it was pretty much a guarantee.

Well, earnings missed. Just a bit. The stock dipped and kept dipping. Over the next week I was down something like 80%, I don't remember exactly. I was pretty crushed. I was so mad at myself, "Of fucking course a stock can go down, *why would you think it can only go up?*" Recrimination, doubt. I knew I wasn't cut out for this...

But I kept coming back to WSB if only, at first, to salve my wounds with the loss porn of fellow fallen PRPL nurples. Then I watched more YouTube videos on options. And I learned—mostly from people on this sub—how to minimize the financial pain of that loss, and maybe break even.

I bought shares, I learned how to sell covered calls. I don't remember exactly everything I did, I was experimenting and learning. After a few months I eventually I broke even.

And I kept experimenting, and watching, and reading.

Beginning of this year I deposited a bunch of money into my brokerage and put myself in really solid positions that I liked. I armed myself with knowledge, I knew my entry points, I knew when I wanted to take on more risk. **As of today, I am in spitting distance of doubling my account since the beginning of the year. That fucking rules.**

I'm still learning. I don't know everything. In fact, I think I'm still a novice, and who fucking knows I could blow my account up tomorrow. But the more I learn, the more the picture of trading becomes illuminated, instead of the inscrutable dark mass it was six months ago.

&#x200B;

**THE FUTURE**

I don't know what's going to happen to GME in the next week, month, year. No idea. If you want to hold GME forever and not really think about the stock market, that's totally fine. But, if you want to dig yourself out of a hole, if you want to keep going with stonks, here's the good news: you can learn.

So what do you do now?

**Shut the fuck up and listen to smarter people**. And read. And watch videos. And see what experienced traders and investors are doing.

Because this sub has recently turned into a roiling ocean of samethink, many of you don't know the power of this place: *you're sitting on a fucking gold mine*. I have read due diligence in here that rivals that of professional analysts, and in some cases is *more insightful and more detailed* (and always funnier)*.* And IT'S FREE.

Do you think DFV got into GameStop on a whim? Because he thought it would be a fun little troll play, and that maybe he could stick it to the hedge funds along the way? No. Go watch his YouTube channel. He knows what he's doing. He is a **fucking pro**.

Remaining stupid isn't an option—you want to be a *smart* retard, not a *dumb* retard.

Before I get too Glengarry Glen Ross on y'all asses, here are some tough love, concrete suggestions:

&#x200B;

**Stop posting and** ***telling*** **people to buy, hold, or sell stonks**

* That's not your call and it may be illegal
* It's amateurish and cringey
* It's perfectly fine to share your positions or say you're still holding

&#x200B;

**Stop calling it a movement**

* We're here to make money, learn, and help each other do both—it's not a political movement
* It's profoundly cringey

&#x200B;

**Stop spamming posts asking if GME, AMC, BB, NOK will "go up"**

* No one *really* knows
* *You* decide whether you should sell or hold
* If you have relevant information about the stonk, that's great! Post it. "Will XXX go up?" is not relevant.

&#x200B;

**Take a break from reddit, your broker, even your computer/phone**

* Staring at a stonk for hours, hoping it will go up, is not healthy—trust me
* You'll be doing your brain a service if you step back and come back refreshed

Sometimes, you just got to pull out. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There needs to be a truce between Gme holders and old timers This is getting ridiculous. Half the sub is yelling HOLD and the other half is yelling SELL. I'm holding my shares and i don't need you apes to tell me when i need to get out. I will when i'm satisfied. 

And GME people need to slow down with their spams and circlejerking. I agree it's making the sub ridiculous.

We can all co-exist in this sub. No need to tell people to go to another sub just because you don't like it. Things change and GME was much bigger than a sub with ~2 million members at the time. 

This unrest will destroy the sub not gme holders or old timers.

/endrant

Edit: with 8 million members now, you can't just attack whoever says gme. As old timers you need to show the way of WSB. Or you can go to another sub and let this one rot. Your call.

Edit2: The response this post got just shows the "old timers" are just angry fucks. There are more than 6 million new members. Whether you like it or not, if you act like rabid dogs you will always be the minority from now on. If you are not willing to even take a small single step, you can get the fuck out of here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stay Vigilant and Skeptical There are so many imposters among us, and if you're new, it might not be as obvious. This is one more post to remind you to remain skeptical and analyze the posts you're reading and do your own DD. I'm not a super OG here, but I've been around for over a year and it's insane how obvious the trickery is, how many super manipulative posts and comments I'm seeing that oppose this sub's mantra right now. SO MUCH sudden gain porn amount gme sellers, posts trash talking holders, saying holding is a bad strategy when you're down, and posts trying to justify selling right now in any way possible. They are designed to sound logical, or even be filled with a few logical points, with the part about how you should sell carefully transplanted in. BULLSHIT obviously. Listen, retard, you don't typically buy SHARES to try to make a fat short term gain, you trade options, so anyone convincing you that it's a normal, good idea to buy and sell shares on highs and lows in a small time frame is a dumbass. If you buy shares, you typically hold for longer than a fucking week and go for a ride for some real growth; or you learn your hypothesis was wrong or was changed by an event and you pivot. This is normal. Yes, there is a potential squeeze, which is more reason to keep your fucking pants on. Yes, the hypothesis has remained 100% unchanged, though certain news sources will try to have you believe otherwise. Missing a high isn't the end of the world, be patient and it will inevitably surpass that price in some amount of time if the company isn't doomed (it's not) and the economy isn't tanking (it's not). In this case, probably pretty god damn soon. At least if you don't listen to me listen to fucking Cuban, his words were a blessing for this sub, powerful messages to keep us united through this shit storm coming from someone that has a lifetime of experience. Remember why you bought GME, has it changed? Then continue pursuing the value play you started until it does. If you bet more than you can afford to say goodbye to for months/years, you probably fell prey to fomo and are an amateur. That's not ideal, so don't ruin your life over this shit, be realistic. If you can afford to, it's common fucking sense to hold right now. Hey, now you get to learn to weather a storm like any seasoned trader so SIT DOWN, BUCKLE UP, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP. 

This is not financial advice I literally just got done snorting glue. 

GME to Andromeda and past 💎✋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hard Truth: It's Entirely Mathematically Possible for Shorts to Cover Last Week If a share can be shorted multiple times, it can be bought and covered multiple times. 

How did 140% short ratio happened:

A has one GME share, A loans the share to B, B sold it short to C, C loans it to D, D sold it short to E. One share, shorted twice. B and D both needs to cover their shorts when they needed to. 

The same scenario can be played the other way around. 

Hedge Fund A bought 1 share from Bank B to cover and return to Bank C, Hedge Fund D then bought the same share from Bank C to cover and return to Bank E. One share, covered twice. 

Now imagine last week, the price is above $200, you are a greedy ass Wall St bank and you have a lot of GME shares on hand and a lot of shares loaned out, do you :

(1) sell it to the shorts multiple times for ridiculous gain yourselves?

or 

(2) just shrug and let the retails take this cake?

The trading volume for GME is above 300m per week for the last  4 weeks, with the highest week to be 550m.  the short float was 72m at its peak. The trading volume is enough for them to cover multiple times every week.

Have they actually covered? Your call. Fuck if I know. We will find out in Feb 9th._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD Peloton $PTON Hello retards,

They are applying Artificial Intelligence to cloud management. 

Think of all that it takes to run thousands of servers in the cloud.. the infrastructure is enormously complicated and there are tens of thousands of servers constantly switching tasks based on demand. Tech has developed cloud deployment and management tools like Kubernetes running Docker and the like. This field is called DevOps and it’s the playground of DevOps engineers. 

Now what if you want to automate as much as possible these incredibly complicated systems? How do you monitor diagnose and alert based on problems you may not even know exist? Can you build automated repair and optimization systems that go beyond the basic building block implementation? 

Enter Dynatrace, which is solving these problems with AI. They have AI anomaly detection, AI automated cloud management, and AI driven optimization.  

The potential for AI in the space is incredible and Dynatrace has only begun to capture market share. They are lightyears ahead of traditional DevOps tooling. 

They recently had a great quarterly report and have broken out of their trading range. A host of analysts have upgraded in recent earnings. As the market realizes their potential I believe there is massive upside especially in this tech bubble.

So pissed with all the added attention to our sub. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My thoughts on firearms and ammunition companies as an investment strategy Good morning assholes.   


I see a lot of people in firearms-adjacent jobs and lifestyles talking up buying stock in gun and ammo manufacturing. I'm not, because I think it's a trap. And not because of any apocalyptic predictions, either. Hear me out.   


Manufacturing both firearms and ammunition requires a substantial investment to set up for, in terms of time and capital. Additionally, these companies can't get support in the form of loans from \*most\* banks because of being reclassified recently as "high risk" for money laundering. I don't agree with this, but what's right and what is real don't always intersect perfectly.   


Because of the temporary nature of the surge in demand, I believe that companies such as Fiocchi and one or two others which have recently added production floor space, \*only\* did so because they were already planning to do so for some time now. So far as I know, there have been no reactive expansions of production as a result of 2020's state of non-stop panic.   


Because after the hype settles down, ultimately, demand will eventually return to normal, most likely way too early for any expansion in production capabilities to lead to an increase in market share or saturation.   


A FEW POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS:  
1. 2020 saw an unprecedented number of new gun owners. Won't that cause an increased long-term demand for ammunition?  
\-Probably not. My feel for the climate right now is that most of those firearms will end up rotting in a safe or getting resold secondhand for cheap and no longer contributing to a consistent demand. This surge in new owners is likely a major contributing factor to the current shortage. Once they all have the requisite one or two boxes that their gun-owner friend recommended they grab, that's probably it for them. That's still MILLIONS of boxes of ammunition, but unlikely to contribute anything in terms of long-term repeating purchases for the majority of new owners.   
2. What if new legislation is enacted?  
\-Then manufacturers will probably pivot toward compliant manufacturing and designs, much like what happened during the last AWB. Demand will surge for a short period and then drop slightly. Puts or shorts may be a better option than stocks or calls if you expect this to happen.  
3. What if nothing happens and things go back to normal?   
\-Then the price of stock should do about the same.   


TL;DR -   


Just because demand appears huge now doesn't necessarily mean there's much in the way of money to be made. A lot of the apparent surge in demand comes from a number of factors that make things look way worse than they really are, and none of these things is likely to last past the next year or two.

We are not your friends, People who tell you to buy or sell are not doing it because they want you to make money. They are doing it because they want to make money off you. I shorted GME so if i tell people to sell it is because i want to make money. I do not care about whether or not you make millions or lose everything. But ask yourself why people are telling you to buy? They dont know you and they do not care if you make or lose money. They are telling you to buy because they want to make money off you.

If you want to buy or sell GME that is fine, but if you buy or sell GME because someone on Reddit told you to. You are a fool and you are allowing people to make money off you.

As we all probably know the USD was taken off the gold standard in 1971. As we're the currencies of many other countries since that time.

Central banks have just been printing more fiat currency since then. Using debt to pay down debt, and needing more debt each time to pay off previous debt. It's a giant Ponzi scheme. 
This is devaluing the money at an astonishing rate, nothing is really getting more expensive, it's just our money and wages are continually being devalued.

But all fiat currency goes to zero value at some point. As it always has throughout history. 
I think the hyperinflationary debt crisis is coming soon. Just like Weimar republic Germany where they needed a "wheelbarrow" full of money to buy a loaf of bread.

Fake money can't go on forever.  And this time its global, because the world reserve currency is the USD which is backed by nothing.  China and Russia probably know this and that's why they're buying and hoarding gold.

Im sure this is what the whole "great reset" is that the world economic forum keeps talking about. Surely anyone who understands a few basic fundamentals about money and history would know this whole Ponzi scheme is going to blow up at some point._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My perspective on $GME First of all, I know a lot of you will think I'm a bot or a shill because I dare to express an opinion that's not 100% in line with everything you've bought into. I don't really know what to do about that, but I'm clearly not a bot and if you can think of a way for me to prove I'm not a shill, I'm all ears.

Second, as some of you know because you've complained about it every time I do it, I've been posting a help message into the big threads on this subreddit, telling people that they can reach out and that they're not alone. I've received messages from over 500 people in the last 4 days, and they're all just happy to have someone to talk to, and to listen to them. Some of them only have a share or two of GME or a few dozen AMC, and some people bought in for over $100,000. 

Almost all of them are selling, or have already sold, and absolutely none of them are buying more. I would estimate, conservatively, that 4 out of 5 people who message me have already sold, and half of the ones who haven't tell me that they're going to ASAP. All of them find me from my posts on this subreddit, which is the most bullish place for GME that exists on the internet, and they're **still** all selling. Please, please, just sort by new on some of these threads, or on the subreddit's front page. Sort by new and read through the posts, and recognize that the sentiment you're seeing on the big posts on here does not reflect the majority, or reality.

Make your own decisions and do what's best for you, but please, understand that nobody is still in this. You are buying into a lie that is being pushed by people who are either trying to make money off of you or don't know any better and NEED to believe that this is going to come back up.

That's all. Do with that what you will. And please, feel free to reach out if you're feeling upset or scared.

I found a way that is helping me to deal with it, and maybe it can help some others.  I have decided that I am going to hold, not because diamond hands or whatever, but because I have decided that it isnt too late to start over.   

The money I put into my meme stocks, I am just going ti consider a total loss, and if it goes up at all, GREAT!!! If not, ok, I already consider it a loss.  In the mean time I have learned some valuable lessons and I learned a ton about the stock market, corruption, news/media and how it is controlled, and emotional investing.

This was a great experience and I am better because of it.  

My plan, at this point, is to hold what I have and diversify from here on out.

This isn't financial advice at all, but I do hope that it helps someone with any feelings of depression/anxiety.

If you can't afford to hold or you need bills paid, sell at a loss, it isn't admiting defeat, it is taking care of yourself.  Do what you have to do.

Trading isn’t about trying to defeat a system. It’s not even about trying to defeat the stock market. The stock market will do what it does, it can’t be defeated, it doesn’t have emotional attachments to wins or losses.  It isn’t for or against any individual or group. It only does what it does and a great trader understands this and trades according to this standard. The only enemy in trading is yourself.

Last week companies like PLTR are back up and trending in the right direction. (I do hold PLTR) I think the EV stocks are about to do the same again as this other sideshow levels out.

Company - Quantumscape - QS  

Product - a lighter, more efficient battery for EV's. Charges faster than a Tesla battery. Protected with Patents so this is not common technology. Gets about 85% charge in 15 mins which is amazing.

Virtually No Debt. The biggest liability on their last Nov Balance sheet was deferred underwriting expenses. 

Volkswagen owns 20% of the company so there is a big potential customer with skin in the game and who can offer vehicle manufacturer feedback and input. They paid $300M for this so its not a gimme to get a good partner. One of their Execs sits in the board.

Bill Gates is also an investor - like him or hate him dude is smart.

After the big GM and Ford announcements this EV thing is real now. Its not just a Tesla thing or the odd product out of the majors. Big money is being put towards product development. This could be an argument for jus going to buy Tesla but its an expensive stock and has the good already priced in. So trying to find others is the challenge. These guys don't have the issues a manufacturer of cars does. Battery technology will have uses outside of vehicles. So that's why I like this component.

Quantumscapes battery is not a full Lithium battery. They are solid state Lithium. Lithium isn't great for the environment but it is the future of batteries so smaller and more efficient is a bonus.

Downside: this is not in major production right now. Its a great technology but is not actively in vehicles. Read: No sales.

The recent sell off was probably due to over excitement and the insiders sold shares after the lock up. However the remaining 95% of insider and employee shares are locked up.

This is not likely a moon shot tomorrow as these things take a while to fully develop but the SPAC gave them a piss pot of cash for R&D.

Next earnings release is Feb 16. If you are feeling good, you can get in before then. If you want to be conservative, wait until this is public. I don't expect there to be any sales. This will be an update on the battery technology and if they have taken on any debt. The last release was a $0.20 loss per share. This is not an all in share and should only be considered if you have some spec space in your account. 

Do your own homework. Check out the company's web page, read some articles. See if the difference in the solid state battery technology versus Lithium Ion makes sense. Forbes has a negative article on the company but its all based on valuation from companies who are not emerging. 

My brokerage firm shows 6.34% short interest. I will look at that as positive for the direction and not a positive in anticipation of a squeeze.

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it:

Overall:
Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy.  This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25.

It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago.

BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon.  Check the chart, retard.

Upside:

BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional "okay" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.
So let's recap so far:

An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's "brick and mortar" expectations online.

Easy win play: Just buy shares if you're scared

**Hey man, your last valuation tables didn’t have DNLI, SAVA, ITCI in them…what’s up with that? You trying to make SGMO look better than it is?** I neglected to put those in, but I realized I should have because they are the other big player in the Alzheimer’s market and SGMO has a 750 Million dollar partnership with BIIB for Alzheimer’s. And yes, it does make SGMO look better considering how robust the pipeline is compared to some of the one-trick ponies. Meanwhile, you got SGMO out there in the trenches doing Alzheimer’s, hemophilia, organ transplant, CAR-T…

**What’s an Orphan Medicinal Product?** Although you could google it, I’ll just let you know it offers an easier path to approval and financial incentives for the manufacturer, since the small patient population would prevent the drug from being financially viable otherwise.

**Speaking of stock price, remember ONCE from the table above?** They were acquired for 4 Billion for one approved therapy. Sidebar- a geene therapy for ocular indication was a smart strategic move because it ain’t hard to deliver to an eyeball (you inject into the eyeball and you’ve hit your target), and the biggest hurdle in geene therapy right now seems to be delivery. So they had a revenue geenerating product, and therefore should have been valued more than SGMO- makes perfect sense. What’s more interesting for us is that they also have a hemophilia A geene therapy, SPK-8011, just like SGMO. And just like Biomarin, the trial results are objectively inferior to SGMO’s. [Although the picture is tiny, you’ll have to squint at this crappy abstract page because I don’t have access to the ITSH abstracts in full.](https://abstracts.isth.org/abstract/phase-i-ii-trial-of-spk-8011-stable-and-durable-fviii-expression-for-2-years-with-significant-abr-improvements-in-initial-dose-cohorts-following-aav-mediated-fviii-gene-transfer-for-hemophilia-a/) Notice the factor levels in Phase 1/2 top out somewhere below 25 IU

^(In case the monke strong crowd was wondering, IU is International Units, which is a measurement of factor level normalized to the general population, where 100 IU would represent the mean factor levels of a large simple size of a non-hemophiliac patient population. Factor is weird- you really don’t need levels of 100 IU to prevent bleeds, which is good because all the geenetic therapies seem to produce levels of factor that wane over time.) 

**SGMOs Phase 1/2 factor levels went to about…ohhhh…**[***more than 100*** for those that received an extended steroid taper (see slides 11 and 12, one of those lucky bastards got up to like 175)](https://investor.sangamo.com/static-files/3238ff23-9b25-4d56-b16c-f603cc6c63e0). KILLIN IT. Of note, Truist issued a “Quick Thoughts” report on Dec 8th with a price target of $23 for SGMO following these results, and it only mentioned the Heme A program results, not any of the 16 others pipeline ventures SGMO has going on. WF has a price target of $36.

**And now for something completely different:** [a patent application to edit mitochondrial genomes](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154288&pt=msg&mid=21569486) . 

**Anything coming up, event-wise?** Aside from the stuff in previous articles, [and this great timeline spaddy posts occasionally on IV,](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154554&pt=msg&mid=21603746) SGMO usually has their full year conference call near the end of February, and they like to make big announcements around that time. FWIW, someone has been buying a LOT of February calls. Maybe SGMO is going to partner with someone diabetes-focused to treat Type 1 Diabetes, since it’s autoimmune and only a natural target for T-Cell therapy. But that’s just wild speculation I was hoping to manifest into existence.

**Q4 Earnings -**

Based on the report published on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-capital-employed-overview-snap-153556988.html), SNAP reported Q4 sales of $911.32 million and earnings fell to a loss of $97.24 million. This was a decrease of 42% from last quarter which is obviously good because in the last quarter they lost $167.86 million in earnings. They were also able to beat the analyst expectations of EPS by 0.02/share. This is why the stock went up 10% after the earnings. They posted strong Q4 results and were able to beat all the expectations.

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

The SNAP is little concerned over the Apple's IDFA policy and because of that they expect low revenue in the following quarter. The increase in users and revenue mainly occurred due to coronavirus pandemic. More and more companies started spending money on the social media apps to promote their products instead of Televisions or movie theatres. As coronavirus pandemic comes to an end, I expect decline in users and decline in revenues for the company. The brands would then start spending ad money on movie theatres, restaurants etc.

&#x200B;

SNAP's competitors Instagram & Facebook has also seen growth in number of users. As digital ad budget continues to grow, there's no guarantee that they would all flow to the SNAP. I personally find ads on SNAP more annoying than I do on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. I expect Facebook & Instagram to collect more ad dollars compared to Snapchat over the period of time.

The stock was trading at 25$ ish during October 2020 and it went up 193% over the span of 6 months.

&#x200B;

SNAP has a good presence in developed markets, however I think it faces difficulty when trying to enter the developing countries.

&#x200B;

I also expect a little bit of pullback from the rally of 10% on Friday. I expect the stock to trade around 55$ in few upcoming weeks.

I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold. 

Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are "paper hands".

The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.

Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them.

I will explain more below.

&#x200B;

**VIRGIN GALACTIC:**

Virgin Galactic is a space tourism company that is moments away from FAA approval which will enable it to begin commercial operations this year. Virgin Galactic sells tickets for $250,000 per person that gives you a plan ride to the edge of space and 6 minutes of weightless bouncing around in the space ship looking back at earth.

&#x200B;

**TEST FLIGHT IS THE KEY:**

February 13th marks the opening of SPCE flight window for their final 2 powered test flights to space. Weather permitting of course, this flight will take place this weekend or on the soonest perfect weather following day.

SPCE's last test flight FAILED. After the failed ignition, their plane glided safety back down to base, proving their safety systems worked as expected. After diagnosis, it was found the software responsible for igniting the rocket system had failed. Virgin Orbit also suffered a failed launch late last year due to the exact same problem.

***Why should we be excited about this test flight if the last one failed?***

Virgin Orbit since corrected the software issue and their next launch was a success! Proving the Virgin rocket engineers are capable of fixing this issue and leaving us very confident they have applied the same fix to the SPCE rocket system.

With this successful test flight, SPCE will gather all the data needed for full FAA approval needed to begin commercial operations. Let's not forget that this will not be their first successful test flight to space either!

This means the successful test flight could see Richard Brandon fly on the first commercial space flight as soon as late March.

When the stock was at $30, market analysts predicted a successful test flight could see the stock reach $54, which would equate to a +60% move.

**The stock is currently $54.+60% increase will see the stock reach $86 IN ONE DAY based on successful powered test flight.**

&#x200B;

**SHORT SQUEEZE:**

According to MarketBeat, SPCE short interest is a fantastic 71% of the float to the tune of 1.6 BILLION DOLLARS.

Many options calls expired on 5th February, meaning Monday they will likely need to buy their shares. The stock is up +22% in just the last trading week and +128% YTD. Shorts are getting very nervous.

Successful test flight will see a huge surge in price as investors flood in to the company as it moves from speculative to viable commercial operations.

With 71% float shorted, we will see an absolutely epic short squeeze when shorts will have no choice but to cover their positions once on the success of the test flight.

&#x200B;

**WHAT'S THE PLAY:**

This all comes down to the success of the test flight.

**If you are betting the test flight will be a success (as I am), get in before February 13th when the flight window opens.**

If you are betting the test flight will fail, short the stock before February 13th._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB helped Silver Lake Group make 113 million in profit. Nice! https://www.ft.com/content/dc349acb-e009-4bb1-8a03-6e3a039ed505

This is essentially a silent battle of the class system. A group of average people talking on the wallstreet elite as a way of wealth redistribution. What makes it unique is is that not only do you have Americans doing it against the hedgefunds but you have middle class members of society coming together from other countries, to band together as a singular unit to say, "Hey, you dont need so much money that you can bet on businesses to die." Then you have stories of people taking the money and buying food, video games for kids, and donating to people in need..
 Its beautiful and what makes it great is we dont have a leader, we arent planning revolts, we are using an internet forum to educate people on the stock market who are then deciding, we wanna bet on the hedgefunds to fail, to fail against the will of the regular citizens banding together to decide, we had enough of your corporate greed.

**POSITIONS:**

TSLA / FNGU / SOXL / NVAX / CCIV / MSTR *shares*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA to newer members of WSB. I want to clarify a few things to some newer members.  You have taken a few jokes we make seriously and it will cause you to lose money. 

First, FOMO is an extremely bad reason to buy a stock or options. If you have to every ask “is it too late?” It is too late. Don’t ever buy a stock after it has rocketed up to ATH. 

This was a very very standard but of advice until GME made it’s crazy run. Now it seems like the norm. It’s not. It never was, and it never will be. GME is a once in a lifetime run. You will very likely never see another one. 

Second, diamond hands. Pretty much the same story. Diamond hands was seen as a very very stupid thing to do. Anytime you nailed even a 2 bagger we would always always tell you to sell it all, or at the very least sell half to secure some profit and hold the other half as a gamble. 

Another note on diamond hands. If you are not familiar with organized pump and dump groups please read up on them. They create runs on a stock, then convince other people to buy it while they sell off securing profits. 

The 3 biggest ways to spot a pump and dump is 1 fomo, and 2 they tell you have diamond hands. (Prior to diamond hands they would say “it might dip, but that’s expected! Don’t sell it will go up!” Lastly they will always sell it as a sure thing. No stock is ever a sure thing. 

New people that witnessed GME are making these pump and dumps extremely easy to pull off. 


My last bit of advice, bag holding isn’t a sound strategy. Holding a stock because you are down on it and only because you are down on it is stupid. Plain and simple. 

Only ever hold on to a stock if you really think it’s going to go up. (With good reason.) you can sell, take what money is left and buy something else that will return a better profit. When you lose, ask yourself, if I didn’t own this stock right now, would I buy it at its current price having seen it drop? If the answer is yes, then hold it, if the answer is I would cum in my pants for a chance to buy in at this price having no losses! Then double the fuck down and buy more.

Open "WSB: To the moon and back TM (c)" with a 2001: A Space Odyssey pastiche - instead of the usual black monolith, have it made from hundreds of boxes of crayons, which one ape prods, and then knocks over.

To The Moonwatcher then starts to feed on all the waxy goodness he has found.

Have a sub-plot featuring gourd buying / having the boat getting delayed and the gourds slowly rotting.

Another sub-plot: a member of WSB slowly becomes more and more ill over the course of the film, and they have no idea why.

At least their stonks continue to 🚀🚀🚀, so they can still purchase wax crayons to feast on.

Have cuts / transitions using dire space-themed special effects. Eg: rockets made using painted washing up bottles, child-painted planets/ moons, etc.

The film's climax needs a 300-inspired HOLD sequence, using the most inappropriate people / cheap ape costumes.

(Already switched broker for new shares and still 👐🏻💎🚀 out of stupidity...) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shouldn't Melvin go under by now? I have a lot of questions about the GME short on the hedge fund side. I'm low key hoping that a former hedge fund person/insider/trading veteran will share some insight, but hey, I'll take any answer that's backed up by research.

1. How does a hedge fund stay alive after sustaining billions in losses? 

I've heard rumors of them selling their long positions to cover their shorts, having time to pay for the shares they shorted, and receiving a loan from Citadel. I'm assuming they've played both sides of the trade and took out new short positions based on recent prices.

2. If they are going under, then how long could it take? Are there historical examples we can point to, I.e. late 90s/2008. 

3. There was a rumor that a NY pension fund is affiliated with Melvin. Is this true? If so, what the hell would happen if an entire hedge fund gambles a pension fund away? Hoping they're smart enough to diversify their clients assets. Any historical examples we can point to?

4. I heard a rumor (yes, yet another rumor) that multiple hedge funds went under/sustained huge losses. Does anyone have specific insight into this?

5. Do we know generally or specifically what securities/assets that Melvin and other related hedge funds have/are invested in? I know we don't have much transparency in terms of investments in the US, but may be there's a well hidden publicly facing investor report that their clients receive. 

6. If we don't know the assets they're invested in, how did we manage to find out that they were behind the GME short? 

7. Do we know of a country with disclosure laws that require individuals/hedge funds to disclose their positions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FYI -$GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB will never be the same thanks to GME When I first joined this group there was probably 1m members.

Just hold. This message is more orientated to new folk.

Its going to continue to drop so wait for that shit to go down to the dollar. We don't know if there's gonna be another squeeze by how the hedgies and RH screwed us over the first time. Them having all the bananas probably have found other ways to screw us over by now. Even Mark's AMA had a lot of "next time you'll come back smarter" phrasing as in the shit that happened here was phenomenal but most likely will have failed.

If it does fail, at least some people were early to buy nuggies. But people buying now is your own risk and not a meme. If it does fail, people well sell with well cash made. When that happens all the late apes will be left to dry for "long term investing" to hide the fact they literally lost thousands. And while losing thousands is great for meme purposes on this sub, all the newcomers are gonna be staring at the charts 24/7 never coming off the toilet.

If all you people who lost a ton of money do get gains somehow (because remember, people already HAVE gains, they just lost some because of the hedgies and want it back or some already cashed out with multi tendies) then consider yourselves lucky because these stocks are dropping and will continue to drop for a while and not everyone will have diamond hands.

Its hard to keep a meme going for so long. The memes are the only thing really pushing this. Once the meme dies, so does the volume. All the inexperienced traders don't know all the other smooth brained people are used to losing will continue to trade like normal, and they'll have nothing left but to stare at their loss cause of a meme and their poor timing to jump on a a bandwagon all late.

On a lighter note. If you already own GME or AMC don't sell yet, there's a good chance we'll at least get a small squeeze. Just don't be an actual retard and lose your life savings over this and keep buying when it hasn't finished dropping. And if you do buy.. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Not for the sake of the stock but for your own sake..

We do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Outlining the problems with Option hedging narrative Hello WSB, honest new poster here. My experience is in commodities so I am actively looking for someone to correct me if I am wrong. I honestly have never worked with something that can be short squeezed, so listen to the comments not my post.

I’ve read the theories of the hedge funds using options to reduce their shorts, if I understand correctly and over simplified:

Hedge funds Sell Call options to a Market Maker, this gives the Market maker the right to hedge their length by selling Synthetic length, there the Hedge funds buy the length and voila shorts are closed, SI reduces. (Previously we were the recipients of these fake stocks, which is how shorts got over 100%)

However the hedge funds are left short options, which basically started this whole thing. What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios. 

They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM):
This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.

They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM):
This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn’t change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.

They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM):
This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.

They bought Puts at any strike:
This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.

TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent. This is honestly the reason I am holding ~75 stock at ~200 entry. And as I said at the start, I feel I am myself wrong so why would you listen to me to make financial decisions. Read the smartest looking comment below and make your own decisions.

It always felt lopsided.  Gamestop will pay you let’s say $3 dollars for a game, then turn around and sell it for $30.

You could argue that Gamestop’s cost of managing inventory justifies the markup.  This did not change anything for me as a customer.  I turned to eBay instead.  I felt I got a truer market value with my exchanges.  Now even though I always bought and never sold on eBay a seller gets the most profits, not eBay.  An individual seller benefiting the most.  Power to the players Gamestop, don’t forget!

Hopefully the buyer got a truer market value as well instead of a set price that probably doesn’t sell until it goes on sale or worse clearance.  Potentially wasting resources required by Gamestop to manage the inventory and floor space.

If Gamestop could eliminate this obstacle, now that I’m diamond FUCKING hands, I could see myself using Gamestop for my used video game exchanges.  Even selling this time.  I could see how Gamestop could use it’s store fronts and name recognition (ape t-shirts anyone??) to leverage itself as the premier destination for the used gaming market to even rival eBay.  Well it fucking better or I’m never getting my tendies.

Now onto the stuff I absolutely loved about Gamestop as a customer.  Midnight motherfucking launches.  Battlefield 3, Destiny, The Order 1886.  I think it was just those three but I had a blast.

You can argue it’s all digital now so the days of actually having to go to the store is done but at the moment, the used market is limited to physical.  Some folks also just prefer physical media.  I know I feel this way about books.

And that’s it unfortunately.  I still love gaming, since the Atari 2600.  I just now purchase digitally so I don’t have to worry about the literal baggage but I think physical media will always have a place.  I still have my N64 and Dreamcast.  Maybe if the conditions are right, I’d even let go of my beloved Dreamcast collection in very good used condition with four controllers fishing rod arcade stick and two official light guns.

Dear Penis Flys of WSB, 

You so generously bought a crap ton of GME shares that most likely were being held by a handful of individuals hoping things would turn around for GME. Well fundamentals alone said run long ago but here me out, (I’ve been a successful full time futures trader for years) now that you have given the pre circus “hodlers” a nice pool of liquidity to sell into, its GME, set, match for this stock. Are you going to leave that capital you borrowed from your relatives, tied up in this bag forever? I didn’t think so. One bankruptcy headline about the company and it’s going to be a violent dash to unload your likely, already realized autistic mistake. I couldn’t be more excited and proud of you guys. You are finally destroying yourself financially like you always promised you would here in this sub. 

Thanks for the memories and be sure to show off your shiny red P/l’s, proving yourself to the world that you are in fact full blown disabled. God be with you gents👀🌈_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Money doesn't care which stock it recovers on! If you are burnt on $GME, the dollars don't have to be recovered on the same ticker. With many of you bag holding GME hoping for a price increase to recoup losses (which may or maynot happen), it is important to remember that your Benjamins don't care which ticker it recovers on.

If you want to hold your positions on GME on principle, then that's all good. But for others, you should remmeber that you can recoup loses on other tickers.. We are in a bull market, and many many many tickers are posting 10% gains each day. Find one that you like and invest in them, and potentially in a couple of months you'd have recovered your losses._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just write calls gdi this thing is a CASH COW. 💎🙌? 💎 💼. If one monke were to hold 100 shares of anything let’s say a game stock that dumb fucking monke doesn’t have to sell anything to make money off it for a good long while. 

Look at the high and low on those calls anywhere down the chain. Even like wayyy otm. That difference can be yours. Is it betraying the bull? Nah, it’s just being smart. And it’s a better alternative to just dropping bags of diamonds cuz your hands are made of paper. You wanna be a purist? I applaud you your hands of diamond. But those of you a little nervous? The bags feeling heavy? Relieve your load dummy, pull a diamond out. Grind those bags lighter, piece by piece, covered call by covered call. You can go all night. We can go every expiration (roll that tide). This could very well just be a war of attrition. A siege lasting many MOONS and many barrages of TANKS. But a siege can last when there’s smugglers and profiteers on your side. The little gangs of the ta kers slowly accumulating raw material to be ready for the final counter. 

Just read this stupid. It’s fucking easy. And maybe finally some of you can stfu about holding bags of diamonds with paper soft hands and you can grow as human beings and investors and add some wrinkles to your baby smooth brains. 

Also this is obviously not fucking financial advice and I’m not a fucking financial anything I linked an investopedia article I only read like a quarter of and even then only intermittently while watching porn.

At this point you might as well hold on to GME shares and hope Gamestop's core business actually recovers so your shares go up to $17 in 3 years from now.

GME is still 120% shorted, I thought that means the squeeze can still come. Am I wrong?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Story time The year is 3069

The 1% is primarily made up of the descendants of the shareholders of Gamestop before the stock went parabolic for the fifteenth time. 

After it was clear no one was selling, the share price hit $24,000 in 2021. Then continued on a divine ascent for the next 2 years, topping 3.5 billion a share. 

Still the share holders did not sell. 

It was at this time, GameStop decided to do something incredible. They released a 10,000 share offering. The shorts being forced to buy back in now that stocks were available instantly made GameStop the most valuable company in the world by millions of times any other competitor. GameStop then immediately bought every business in the world and announced a 1% quarterly dividend. 

Within 10 years all holders of GameStop shares would be wealthy enough to replace not only their hands with diamonds, but also every member of their family’s as well. 

Overall not much changed beyond this. You could still eat at a GameStop Subway or a GameStop Jersey Mike’s. You could even find some GameStop Quiznos still around, as no company could ever go bankrupt again. 

Melvin and his cronies died as feudal slaves, as insufficient funds left only their weak paper hands and rigid brains as repayment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It’s not much but it’s an honest living 🤷🏽‍♂️ 📈☝🏽.

Edit: according to the rude comments, this isn’t the place to learn. Literally had no idea before I made the post. I don’t understand why y’all are acting “superior than though” about the face that I’m green. I don’t think any of you knew anything about investing when you first started. Please have some common courtesy_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's easier to short a 400$ stock than to short a 15$ stock. I feel like most people took their profits on $GME because it DID squeeze. It wasn't a gamma squeeze because it is NOT the same as the $VW stock.  Because in that case, Porche owned like 80% of the shares, and Porche it's a UNIT, it's a company, 1 person can coordinate it. But because we are a lot of people and you can NEVER know what someone will do, especially on the internet. It probably won't happen again. If you really want to see something happening you should take all the stocks talked about here in some order and take some profits from each of them. Because I feel like the other stocks didn't squeeze, not even once. They look like some P&Ds. If you really wanted to squeeze again $GME, you would probably have to go with it again to 500$ and actually hold. But such a run up again doesn't seem feasible in my view. So the best thing now should be to focus on another one.

I recently set up a Fidelity account and am waiting for information to process so my bank account is linked. I had no positions because well. No money.  I am currently waiting for RH to transfer stuff (they are expecting the 10th, but who knows, i was hoping to be able to shed more funds for some shares on fidelity.)

When i noticed the weirdest thing. 

Out of no where i had a share show up for GME. And the account claimed it was negative 600 something. 

Stranger still, it was on Margin.  I thought Margin bad, so i haven't bought one on Margin. But again, i haven't bought one period on fidelity yet there it was...

Well, now, the share and the account are gone / zero. Just like when this all started.

RH still has all my shares though... and i can't buy or sell them because my account is deactivated while the transfer is pending. 

I seriously don't know what happened...

So don’t whine about losing all your money. Don’t ask for handouts on this sub, because you risked more than you could lose. More than anything, stop acting like ignorance makes you strong. It never did. 

It’s your money. You made grown up decisions. Own your losses. Don’t let legislation take more freedoms away from us within the “free market” to protect us, the ‘poor dumb apes.’

WSB is being scapegoated for this fiasco, even though many of us had good reasons to invest in GME. The thing that wasn’t accounted for by most people was the sudden restriction on buying for multiple days until all momentum died. The ability for brokers to abruptly make that decision needs to be challenged.

So pull yourself together and do some research about the way brokers created an artificial selling pressure to push the price down. Then, maybe contact your state representatives with something more coherent than diamond hands and ape noises.

been here a long time and its sad to see the sub go like this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So what about the GameStop business model makes GME a good buy? Or is it simply a meme stock? I mean seriously, GameStop has been slowly becoming the Blockbuster Video of gaming and people are thinking that GME is a longterm investment.

They have been closing down stores left and right.

Get at me_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RH hate is dumb and misguided. Stop crying about RH, your GME movement is crying about RH and touting sticking it to the billionaires, meanwhile RH only folded in that moment because they are a smaller new platform with no where near as much $ - I’m sure if RH could have afforded to continuing letting retail consumers buy shares they would have - then you all flocked to multi-billion dollar brokers while claiming you hate the 1%_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "Hold" means "moon" in Hungarian.

I find it useful for any that are giving into negativity by the hands that give hand-jobs with the quality grip of paper, to realise GME is not just a mere speculative bubble anymore but a plausible and prosperous business model with longevity in mind. Here is an extract from a research paper of what to think about while you hold with those diamond hands of yours. If you must get further approval from your wife’s boyfriend then do so but make your own choices.

“Although the years-long short thesis implies a terminal value of zero (bankruptcy), we see this outcome as virtually impossible given the current state of GameStop’s financials, incoming console revenue, and proven ecommerce results trajectory. In fact, our analysis clearly shows
3 distinct paths to profitability:

• A Bear Case ($32.00) tracking the existing “GameStop Reboot” initiative, with successful footprint rationalization to 2,000 stores in North America by 2023, steady ecommerce contribution, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.

• A Base Case ($80.00) that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.

• A Bull Case ($169.00) based on a full transition by 2025 to the ecommerce- first “cultural gaming hub” hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with a significant increase in revenue attributed to ecommerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.”

I need to confess I sold as the doubt kicked in and the paper hands got to me. So that makes me a paper hand chimp now (forgive me). My hands may have became paper, however I promise I will turn these disgusting so-called hands back into beautiful diamonds by holding till they touch the dark side of the moon to repent for my sin.
