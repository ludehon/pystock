 Triterras is Potentially Undervalued. Let’s start with the basics. 

Ownership: 
58 Institutions currently have a position 
62% of shares are held by insiders 
30% of shares are held by institutional investors 

Assuming insiders and institutions who opened a position won’t be selling at the 7-15 dollar levels which have been reached over the past month or two I will for this post remain under belief they won’t sell in the near future at these prices.

Several short attacks have been published over the past 2 months. Both short reports caused a massive drop in share price and both times these claims have been refuted by the higher ups at Triterras. 

This leads to the Value section. If these short reports are actually unfounded does that mean that TRIT is trading below its intrinsic value? Possibly but also take into account some of the issues the short reports claim such as Rhodium (both companies founded by the same person) accounting for over 50% of Triterras  transaction volume. This has been refuted but to be honest I’m not here to debate one claim or another what I’m interested in is evidence.

After the first short attack the CEO and chairman of TRIT Srinivas Koneru on Dec 21st announced his intention to buy shares for himself because of the drop in share price caused via short attack. He has bought about 169,000 shares since then. This was an open market transaction which to my understanding means he paid somewhere between 7-15 dollars per share (TRIT share price from the 21st of Dec to the 22nd of Jan).

TRIT has also authorized a share buyback. Allowing them to purchase up to 50 million worth of stock. This buyback has not occurred yet as far as I can tell. 

TRIT projections/guidance/ predicted EPS which are all reportedly in favor of TRIT being undervalued and/or a growth stock doesn’t matter to me. The 3 analysts covering TRIT have a price target of 16-23 dollars once again this does not matter to me, it is however a potential elevating factor. 
 
What does matter to me is the available shares. If 62% are held by insiders and 30% are held by institutional investors that ties up 92% of the available shares. There are only 83.2 million shares of TRIT. If 92% of shares (62% insiders/30%Tutes) are owned by people who didn’t sell in the 15 dollar range for tax reasons or the belief that 15 is still undervalued, that leaves 8% of the shares unaccounted for. 8% of 83.2 million shares equals roughly 6.6 million shares available. If the share price was around 8 dollars when the buybacks began and the buybacks were for the full 50 million wouldn’t that mean they would be buying 6.25 million shares from the 6.6 million shares available leaving less than 1 million shares. This stock is heavily shorted (only 80000 shares left to borrow as of 1/22 according to IBorrowdesk) meaning if this buyback were to occur around the current price levels only a fraction of the 6.6 million shares available now would be available to purchase for shorts closing out their positions.

I’m not sure what to believe.  I think it is important to note that the Market Cap to Gdp ration is 192% and the Dow to Gold Ratio is greater than 15.

My hopes are that there is a major correction (dare I say crash) coming up and I can get a lot of good stocks at a major discount.  But I’m not sure how long I’m willing to wait for this to happen.

Update on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kh66j3/clubhouse_ipo_possibilities_in_2021/), but Clubhouse is quickly evolving and reaching heights of growth not seen this quickly by other social media apps in their earlier stage of development. 

The last time we checked they were at 600k users which was a few months ago - now they are sitting at more than 2 million registered users and growing exponentially by the day. As a person that uses the app, the value is absolutely unreal. 

"Andreesen’s firm, called Andreessen Horowitz, is expected to lead the prospective Series B round after leading the earlier Series A round, when it beat out some of Silicon Valley’s top venture firms. The firm’s investment rivals Sequoia Capital, Benchmark, and Lightspeed Venture Partners have considered trying to invest in the potential new round. It’s possible that a deal may not materialize or could come at a valuation lower than $1 billion."

So $1 billion may be a reach but the interest has been piqued. If it doesn't get to a billion, I think it might be close. Also, they are moving into the influencing space by launching a "[Creator Pilot Program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/style/clubhouse-app-influencers.html)" Currently, there is not a way to monetize on Clubhouse (both users and company) but with the influx of knowledge being shared on the app, this definitely can be in the future. 

Also with people still being under stay-at-home orders, slow rollout of vaccines, many people are finding their way on this app or clamoring for an invitation. It is still available for iPhone users but once Android is developed, i can see this increasing users by at least 4x. 

Keep your eye out on this one...

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

> As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.
*****
> Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.
*****
> “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.
*****
> “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.
*****
> Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.
*****
> Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.
*****
> “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.
*****
> “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.
*****
> “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.
*****
> There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.
*****
> Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.
*****
> Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.
*****
> “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”
*****
> “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”
*****
> Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.
*****
> Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.
*****
> Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.
*****
> “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.
*****
> He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.
*****
> “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

> # February Almanac: Worst S&P 500 Month of Post-Election Years

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.

> # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note

> Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!

> The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**

> Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**

> While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**

> As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.

> # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed

> Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**

> In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**

> Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.

> Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**

> While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**

> Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**

> Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.

> # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here

> It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

> With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”

> It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).

> We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.

Sold Jumia at bottom etc.    Several examples later,  now he is holding 8000 shares of Carnival cruise line.  He has been holding for a few months and he is down on position a bit.   I think he might have learned his lesson to sit tight.  However,  as I was discussing with him yesterday,  I asked how does the company currently generates revenue.  He said it doesn't.

According to market research group Ampere Analysis, Netflix hit 11 million British subscribers in 2019, bringing the company around £940 million in subscription revenues.

The company spent $1 billion on locally-made films, series, and documentaries in the U.K. in 2020. The £3.2 million in taxes — which are paid on profits — is the most the company has ever dished out to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, largely as a result of Netflix’s investment in Britain.

In the future, Netflix plans to alter its tax structure to be more localized, in line with its long-term plans in the U.K. This could mean that its revenues from British subscribers in 2020 will be reported to tax authorities._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AUPH UPDATE!!!

This past week the stock has rose around 25% in total growth. Indivior is the number 1 leader in the buprenorphine market which is the current political issue that America is facing. All people facing depression due to corona virus had caused Indivior value to reach high 40's. With corona "respiking" according to the media and the new strains coming as well as many people being forced away from there previous lives, causing depression, there is unlimited potential for the number one leader in the fastest growing market in the world. All people in the world face this issue and the stock is at an all time low value of nearly 9 dollars after making a 25% jump. Analysts value this stock to soon reach values of near 15 and this is much before the Q4 and 2020 Evaluation come out. This stock could very well reach huge numbers very soon and many other people have already capitalized on this soon growth as you can see in Indivior's RNS filings.

January 22, 2021, 2:49 PM ESTUpdated on January 22, 2021, 3:56 PM EST

Frenetic options trading. A sea of shares sold short. Chat room range wars. Pretty much everything with the potential to slingshot a stock into the stratosphere was at play in GameStop Corp. Friday.

“GameStop is a true animal,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “It’s a rare convergence of a short squeeze combined with some fundamental news and an army of fast money traders.”

If any single fact explains the histrionics, it’s this: GameStop stock equal to 141% of its available shares has been borrowed and sold short, a bearish position showing mark-to-market losses of over $1.74 billion, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. (A single share can be shorted multiple times.) Gains beget gains when shorts are under that kind of pressure, forcing them to buy back stock as it rises.

In the options market, where dealer hedging also has the potential to fuel rallies, a record 913,000 GameStop calls traded as of 3:43 p.m. on Friday, as a showdown between short-seller Citron Research and hordes of Reddit day traders ended with the stock soaring as much as 79%. A bullish GameStop contract with a strike price of $60 expiring Friday was the most actively traded option across exchanges, according to Bloomberg data. It jumped 2,700% to roughly $1.97, from just $0.07 on Thursday.

￼

GameStop’s brick-and-mortar, often mall-based presence has made it a favorite among short sellers for years -- it has rarely left the list of their top targets on the New York Stock Exchange. That, along with its relatively small float, made it tempting for crowd-sourced chat-room cadres who naturally glom to shares trading in the single-dollars.

Which GameStop used to do, but does no longer. At $57, the stock now trades for 50 times annual earnings in the next year analysts forecast it will be profitable -- its fiscal 2023. But trading heated up Friday, with more than 175 million shares changing hands during the session, 21 times the daily average of the past year.

The GameStop frenzy comes after a Tuesday tweet by Citron, in which the short seller wrote that “buyers at these levels are the suckers at this poker game.” That spurred a wave of backlash of the 1.9 million-member-strong Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, prompting Citron managing partner Andrew Left to say Friday that the firm will stop commenting on the stock.

￼

Amid the battle, GameStop surged as much as 116% this week, with Friday’s surge triggering a trading halt for the stock and marking its most volatile 10-day period on record. Shares have rocketed over 200% higher so far this month.

Traders are also chasing those gains in the options market, according to Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy.

“It’s an epic combination of retail traders chasing momentum on a highly shorted stock,” said Murphy, the firm’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Those investors may be viewing the January $60 calls for a max loss of about $2 as a better way to express their opinion than buying the stock for $58.”

(NASDAQ: AUPH / TSX: AUP) (“Aurinia” or the “Company”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LUPKYNISTM (voclosporin) in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen to treat adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN). LUPKYNIS is the first FDA-approved oral therapy for LN. LN causes irreversible kidney damage and significantly increases the risk of kidney failure, cardiac events, and death. It is one of the most serious and common complications of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LUPKYNIS is now available to patients in the United States (U.S.).

Aurinia will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the approval of LUPKYNIS on Monday, January 25, 2021 at 8:30 a.m. ET. The webcast can be accessed on the investor section of the Aurinia website at www.auriniapharma.com. 


Good news to all the AUPH stockholders out there. Are you selling or holding for a potential buyout?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The GME Short Squeeze Hi everyone
I had a question about all the GME stuff going on. I was wondering how this short squeeze and margin calls work. I keep seeing people talking about how the jump to about 72 was due to a margin call and not the squeeze. What exactly happens with the squeeze then? Does that mean it's an even larger jump, because I though there was a rule against going up to fast in a given time. If any one could explain, I'd appreciate it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do the guys on CNBC's options action make money on their trades? Do the guys on CNBC's options action make money on their trades?

Since I follow the markets fairly closely, I recently decided to open a separate brokerage account to take a more active approach. My hope is to invest into a handful of sector/thematic ETFs to supplement the total market approach of my Roth. Any thoughts on the following 5 for 2021 and beyond? 

ICLN - Clean Energy (25%)

ARKF - Financial Technology (25%)

XHE - Medical Equipment (25%)

QQQM - NASDAQ-100 (15%)

For starters, I’m 19, and while I don’t have massive amounts of money (<$10k portfolio),  I’m trying to solidify my future. Even though I don’t have much now, I earn fast now so I have more to invest with in the long run.

WSB hype aside, I thought it was a good idea to buy shares of GME to capitalize off the short squeeze for easy earnings. Between the price ranges of $38-$58, I bought 96 shares (about 4.3k) and ended today with a $1.3k profit. 

I was considering buying a call in an attempt to keep the gains from today while still potentially earning more, while “risking less.”

Would that be a bad idea?

Edit: since it wasn’t clear, I didn’t buy GME because of WSB. Crazy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First time posting, long time investor...

Thank you in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nokia 2021 POSITIVES:  


\- New board chairwoman, CEO and CFO all committed to wide-reaching reforms, frank communication and (unlike has happened in the past) creating shareholder value when the reforms have had the time to produce their effects;  
\- New strategy aiming for number 1 or 2 position in each business while requiring profitability everywhere in the organization;  
\- New simpler organization (matrix ditched) meaning faster decision-making (e.g. Tommi Uitto in Mobile Networks instead of 5-6 authorizations previously needed to close a deal), more costs and employees placed under business groups (BGs) which as mentioned above need to reach their profitability targets;  
\- SoC proportion rising relentlessly in 5G Reefshark chipsets lowering Nokia's costs constantly until some time in 2022 when the proportion reaches 100%;  
\- R&D efforts underway to close the 5G feature gap by the end of 2021;  
\- Nokia is overall profitable and has a large scope of businesses with three profitable BGs and one break-even BG: all of them have scope to improve profitability;  
\- Nokia arguably trades at below the sum of its parts, meaning considerable upward potential whenever value is in one way or another released.  


NEGATIVES:  


\- Due to additional R&D and perhaps restructuring costs Nokia's result will probably not rise this year (at least not by much) as the biggest BG will just break even;  
\- Strategy execution is crucial and here for instance former CEO Suri failed;  
\- The R&D race is costly and a never-ending process where also competitors improve all the time;  
\- New competitors can emerge due to open RAN and virtualization;  
\- Huawei may be partly let off the hook as part of a "dialogue" between the US and China;  
\- Nokia may still drop more as negative SP development feeds into negative expectations which need to be corrected in a credible way (e.g. on the capital markets day March 18);  
\- Nokia can be the object of a hostile bid which undoubtedly raises the SP but so modestly that many long-term holders will feel short-changed.  


CONCLUSION: I believe Nokia Nokia's current SP is undervalued seen to both the sum of its parts and especially seen to its potential. I also believe Nokia has correctly identified the previous problems and is taking the right action so as to become a shareholder-friendly, value-creating company. Just to mention my main argument: IF NOKIA'S MOBILE NETWORKS REACH THE PROFIT MARGIN OF ERICSSON (15%) NOKIA'S SP WOULD RISE BY ABOUT $4.80 when applying a P/E of 15. This improvement would come even without any increase in sales or any additional contribution from the other business groups. I foresee improvements across the board, but just this one margin improvement would more than double Nokia's SP.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musks-spacex-plans-natural-gas-drilling-in-texas-report-2021-01-22_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn’t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to see a great returns within the coming months!

$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath’s SPA). Chamath’s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover’s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he’s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she’s in it for the long haul.  if there’s one thing we know, it’s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There’s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable “smart money” includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they’ve invested in. Follow the smart money 💎💎💎


Let’s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they’ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There’s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They’ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That’s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that’s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. 

Let’s talk a little more about what Clover does. They’ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They’re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that’s not all they do. Here’s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. 

Future catalysts include:

-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn’t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) 

-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?

-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. 

-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age 

-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon!

-technicals: there’s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. 

-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there’s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That’s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there’s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That’s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = 🚀

This to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon 🌚 

Position: YOLO averaged up to $14 with entire life savings_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The market going forward So I’m wondering if anyone has ideas about the future of the market and strategies to maximize profit going forward. I think the internet, YouTube, commission free trading, etc have altered the way the market operates to an extent.

Was wondering if that was a really bad move on my part.
  
Currently I am up £1,580.00 (8.5%) in my ISA account. And I am up £634.87 (30.93%) (this is from one stock) in my invest account.
  
So that puts me at over £2,000 in around 3 weeks, maybe I just got lucky?! Of course I did make sure I was buying into solid companies.
  
Do you guys think I should seek professional advice or keep doing what I'm doing now?

Thoughts ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HYLN vs PLTR: which to get into? Looking to put ~58k into either of these. Shares only, no options. Looking at the charts, HYLN has been beat down. They have no PR but do have a product. It’s a green energy trucking company— there are EV companies out there, but this is a different market. There doesn’t seem to be much talk about it at the moment, and I feel like any kind of deal, contract, or even rumors of a contract can send this thing soaring. Would look to enter ~$17.35 on Monday morning, if current prices hold. 

Then there’s PLTR, another speculative play. Already up pretty big since DPO a few months ago. It’s hyped, lots of talk around other subs on Reddit. Demo day coming up, but lockup period ending in February as well. Would look to enter ~$30-$32. 

Assuming I’m going in on shares with both of these, which has higher opportunity to pay off big? I feel like HYLN, strangely, is going to run hard if some positive news comes out for it. 

What do you guys think about picking one of these two?
