 Advice on Momentum ETFs First time posting.

I have been investing on individual stocks mainly AIM stocks in the LSE, about 7-8 stocks with averaging 10% return. Mainly the stocks are undervalued companies following bargain shares strategy. 

I’d like to look at adding a larger holding on an ETF but looking at something that would give me exposure to a different investment strategy. I dont have the understanding/tools to invest based on share price momentum. Does anyone have recommendation on ETFs that focus on momentum. Pros/cons of the approach. 

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ROCH: An overlooked Green Play  **Summary** 

* Polypropylene has a $98 billion global market spread across a wide range of industries and products of which <1% of that market is derived from recycled material.
* PureCycle is a technology leader in recycling polypropylene (“PP”) plastic, it possesses a patented and proven purification process that produces nearly virgin-quality resin from plastics. 
* Strong pushes from both consumers and regulatory bodies to move towards the use of recycled plastic make for a great opportunity and an untapped market. 
* Despite strong market demand, PureCycle is the only player in the game with both the technology and cost competitiveness to supply recycled PP. As a result, it has already been approached with overwhelming interest from corporations.
* To play their parts in the drive for “Going Green” many corporations are targeting high rates of recycled content in PP products for the future.  PureCycle’s global commercial partners to date include L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Total, and BMW, as well as several high-quality investors.
* There is a tremendous risk/reward opportunity at current prices, with revenue and EBITDA achieving hyper growth as plants come online with attractive economics, margins, and high ROIC. Assuming 30x EBITDA, PT YE’25 is $237 with shares trading at $8.99 today.

**The Play**

There is an increasingly big push from both environmentally-conscious consumers and governmental regulation to solve the building global plastic problem. As the Democrats assume power in Washington a push for environmental policy is expected, and single use plastic being banned in several states is just one example of the regulation to be expected for the future.  Most investors are focused on green energy and consumer technology, while waste management and recyclables go overlooked.  PureCycle is a revolutionary technology company focused on transforming waste PP into virgin-like resin. The same story that is driving enthusiasm for  Enphase, Sunrun, and Tesla can be applied and seen for PureCycle Technologies.  There is a massive global market for its taking, as no other companies or technologies can efficiently address PP recycling at scale. PureCycle holds the exclusive license to its patented solvent-based purification recycling technology, with the ability to commercialize it and bring recycled PP to market. With a disruptive technology, strong moat around the process, and tremendous demand given the consumer and regulatory environment, this creates an extremely exciting opportunity.

**The Market**

PP is used across a wide range of industries, including consumer packaged goods, electronics, automotive, building and construction, and agriculture.  At the moment you see virgin PP in plastic containers, potato chip bags, razors, as well as food grade applications.  The recycled PP at the moment can only be used for dark plastic applications such as trash cans, rugs, and plastic furniture due to the greying color and unpleasant odors that still remain. 

 The annual global demand of PP is roughly 173 billion pounds selling at approximately $0.57 a pound landing the total addressable market at \~$98 billion.  The PP market has grown at an average of 4% a year for the past 5 years and is expected to continue to climb at similar rates in the coming years.  As of 2020, due to polypropylene being extremely difficult to recycle, less than 1% (.8%) of all purchased PP is recycled.  The demand potential for high quality recyclable PP, technology moat, and large time and cost barrier of entry positions PureCycle in a very strong place to start to meet the demand and create a recycle loop that the market is desiring.  

An increasing number of companies are now setting sustainability mandates to act as a key differentiator. L’Oreal is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025, moving to 100% by 2030, while Procter & Gamble is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2030. In a $98bn market, broad sustainability goals targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025 represents a $49bn opportunity in the next five years. The demand side of this equation can be satisfied by PureCycle’s world-first recycling process, as it produces high quality resin without compromising appearance, purity or performance. PureCycle’s product quality has been tested and validated by Procter & Gamble, large contractual customers, and third-party engineering specialists. PureCycle is the only player able to capitalize on this tremendous demand opportunity and has already pre-sold 4x their existing capacity – all without a sales force. This technology can close the recycling loop for PP and be delivered in a cost-effective way.

**Proprietary Technology with Tremendous Pricing Upside**

PureCycle developed a physical separation process that utilizes a specialized solvent based purification process. All unit operations are well-known and commercially available at scales much larger than required by PureCycle and involves process operating conditions comparable to current polyolefin production conditions. This includes standard equipment like a Scheibel Extraction Column, a Decanter, Settler and Solid Extraction, candle filters, adsorption filters. This is important because it means the equipment is readily available and at the size that would be needed to scale the operations. The unique aspect here is what goes into the process, the filters/solvent used, temperature and pressure maintenance etc. This process also only consumes 1/7th the energy and is more cost efficient than producing virgin polypropylene. PureCycle can essentially recycle anything that has high PP content and create virgin quality resin. 

The attractive pricing upside is easily found in the market rates of virgin PP selling at \~$0.57 / lb and recycled PP costing between $1.00 to $2.00 / lb.  With regulation and consumer demand driving businesses to buy recycled PP and PureCycle having a much higher quality product produced at a lower cost to other recycled PP it is safe to say there is a lot of pricing upside potential.  

**Competition?**

Other approaches to plastic recycling have existed in the market for decades, but they are limited in application, not cost competitive, and have failed to gain any meaningful traction as a result. Chemical recycling does not yield contaminant-free resin – limiting its potential food grade applications – and also has high energy costs. Mechanical recycling only works in limited use cases – not with any discolored feedstock, as the output becomes gray – and the product generally smells and looks unprofessional with melt flow index issues. PureCycle owns the only process that can take any feedstock and produce resin at a comparable virgin quality to virgin plastic -- usable for food-grade consumption.  PureCycle also has a solid margin profile, as they are able to produce the product at 1/7th the energy cost of virgin.

**The Bears Case**

Some investors are worried about the fact that Procter and Gamble are the true owners of the patents that created the technology and PureCycle is only leasing them. The concern is that for some reason P&G licensed out the technology to other players.  P&G decided to invest and develop the technology to solve a problem that they had with desiring to make their packaging from recyclable products.  They decided that they didn’t have the commercial ability to bring it to market and made more sense to find a 3rd party to scale the business and PureCycle was chosen.  The lead scientists and people from P&G are still working with PureCycle in more of a partnership than simply licensing the technology out.  P&G is still very heavily invested and desires to see the success and scaling of PureCycle for its own benefits and goals and has agreed to be on the line to personally protect the patents for PureCycle as part of the deal.  The current deal with PureCycle is an agreement to perpetuity, which should ease any hesitations by investors. No one else will be licensing this process/technology for the duration of the patents and Purecycle has developed a lot of their own patents as part of the commercialization efforts.

Another case against the buy is the fact that it is a SPAC deal between Roth and PureCycle and there is increased risk.  This is in fact true, but the reality is the deal has already been announced and is simply waiting for the SEC to sign off.  To date the SEC has not stopped an announced merger from closing for regulatory reasons and there is no reason to believe this deal should be any different.  Roth is excited about the partnership as they view the business as a slam dunk opportunity. 

**The Potential and Comps**

Major global commercial customers including L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Ravago and Total have already signed agreements committing to purchasing hundreds of millions of pounds a year.  These contracts have already guaranteed 4 years of maximum output from PureCycle, while many other major retailers are potential to fund and drive the growth of other facilities and plants.  PureCycle has a deal with Nestle who has a goal and company commitment to seeing that 100% of its packaging is 100% recycled by 2025.  Deals like these will continue to drive demand for the technology that only PureCycle can deliver on as of today.

From a valuation perspective looking at the landscape, environmental services companies, waste managers of the world trade at \~10x – 18x EBITDA. This includes players like Advanced Disposal, Republic Services, Waste Management. The process technology players such as Albemarle, Amyris, Trex, Rogers Corporation get a larger premium, trading at a \~20x – 25x EBITDA. For the players with high growth, high margin potential and in ESG, the multiple starts to jump up quite significantly to \~30x+ EBITDA, companies such as Enphase, Solaredge, Array, Plug Power, Ballard Power etc. 

PureCycle, with high value add and a unique offering, high margins, high growth, a proprietary process, large addressable market, and ESG is trading at a very attractive price point at 8.8x EBITDA. There is significant potential for rapid multiple expansion as their development plan is successfully executed. 

This is a hyper growth story in revenue/EBITDA as plants come online with attractive economics. Financial projections show \~60% gross margin on the products and a \~30% ROIC for future plants at scale. The return profile here is very attractive even with the pre-revenue valuation. Assuming 30x EBITDA, TP here is $237 by YE’25._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do I close position on this delisted preferred stock?

So I was reading about the Apple car and them using Lidar technology, which led me to research on Lidar companies in the market.

So we have:
Luminar Technologies
Aeva
Innoviz
Velodyne
Ouster

Without going into too much detail, it seems to me the obvious Lidar which Apple would purchase from is Aeva Lidar? And this is not only for their Apple car but also Apple iPhones.
The Aeva lidar is as small as a chip (hence the lidar on a chip name) which confirms to Apple design philosophy whereas other companies would get a flat out "no" (remember, Apple design teams run the company not the engineers). They are also cheaper and all around just "better" in terms of Lidar tech.

More coming with low float, over sold, overshorted, and grossly undervalued market cap. Bears think that articles from several years ago before SLS took over Galena ticker are even remotely relevant and that posting them on Reddit and Stocktwits is breaking shocking news hahaha. SLS just signed a massive $200 million licensing deal with $7 million upfront and another $8.5 million near term plus royalty payments based on the sale of GPS in China and they don't have to spend a dime, 3D Meds is doing all of it. This was one of the top 10 licensing deals in 2020 for China BIO. Not to mention we had amazing GPS and NPS trial data that was recently released and shorts oversold the held out of it again to suppress the news. That is fine it always bounces back faster and higher when shorts do that.

SLS has plenty of cash on hand with the exercising of the warrants from the $3.00 private placement in the summer of 2020 and the last direct offering done at $7.00 share on 12/14. They have more than $35 million in cash with a $3-$4 million a quarter burn rate. T**hey are about to post the first-ever positive earnings for Q4 of 2020 in March. It's not too late to get in before that major milestone.** The brokers/markets makers are currently get hit with reg sho failure to deliver violations to the sum of 1,209,183 shares from December. That is almost 10% of the available float in failure to deliver! That combined with the excessive short interest is the perfect combination for a massive squeeze.

The burn rate is super low so the shorts only hope of more dilution or another reverse split is completely gone, that is why they are panicking. SLS has plenty of cash for years and the GPS licensing deal with Chain was only for China. One country, plenty more to come especially considering we just got IMPD approval for our phase 3 regal study with GPS from the French Regulatory Authority and German Regulatory Authority. $$$ is coming soon from European Countries.

I've been in and accumulating like crazy for over 2 years. 102,081 shares at a $3.13 average. I held all the way through the $1.45 shake out in April of 2020.

Nothing negative has come out to justify the price action. It's shorts trying their last-ditch effort to keep their cash cow. But the problem is, it's beyond undervalued. At a $71 Million market cap, it should be north of a billion when you look at every comp with the pipeline and stage they are in. The fact that we are still under $250 million and we have commercialization dollars coming in from China is absolutely insane.

(UK) Ok so maybe the titles is confusing, and maybe I’m just not understanding.

But let say I earn £30,000 a year. £11,000 of that is tax free, however, £19,000 of it is taxed at a rate of 20% meaning every year I spend £3,800 on taxes.

Now I read that I was able to claim my stock losses against my stock gains meaning I wouldn’t have to pay tax.

For example, I sell my portfolio at -£20 loss during the middle of the year, I get back in and end up selling it at a £100 profit later down the line, I then have to pay 20% tax on the £100 profit, however, because I lost £20 at the middle of the year I can claim that against my profit thus cancelling out any tax and I get to keep £100.


Now assuming one year you put in £3,800 into the market, and you lose every single pound of it.

Can you now claim that £3,800 lost against your annual income tax of £3,800 thus regaining that £3,800 in tax relief.

Is this correct? Because if it is, does that not mean that every single working human who in this case earns £30,000 a year essentially has £3,800 that they cold invest into the stock market every year, and in theory lose none of it.

Maybe I’ve misunderstood somewhere, but if this is the case surely it that means it would be illogical for anyone paying tax to not be investing their annual taxable amount each year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A place to find total addressable market in general and Roku's TAM?

With the recent inauguration of President Biden and the rejoining of the Paris Climate Accord, the US Government is poised to make a run at adopting clean energy techniques and methods while slowly straying away from conventional fossil fuels, for the purpose of slowing down the rapid effects of climate change. However, some people are divided on this issue, as one side views the transition to green energy as a necessary step, while another views it as a job and industry killer. On top of this, the use of biodiesel as a “green” fuel is certainly controversial as well with many companies transitioning to battery-based, electric vehicles instead of any other alternative fuel. However, the US Govt currently acknowledges that biodiesel is “carbon neutral”, stating that the plants which are the sources of the biodiesel are CO2 sinks [which counteract the effect of combustion on the atmosphere](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biofuels/biodiesel-and-the-environment.php). 

Nevertheless, renewable and clean energy companies will certainly benefit from this new administration’s push to make our energy more efficient and less harmful to the environment. One of these companies is a publicly-traded company by the name of Renewable Energy Group ($REGI). Headquartered in Ames, Iowa, it produces various different biodiesel products that can be used for fuel in diesel vehicles. However, unlike its diesel counterpart, biodiesel emits 78% percent less CO2, according to the US Department of Energy. Biodiesel produces a slight 1 to 2 percent less energy than regular diesel per gallon, according to Alternative Fuels Data Center. Nevertheless, many users will not see a noticeable difference in performance. It also emits less CO2 than electric vehicles that operate off the national average grid, which still isn’t fully renewable yet in most states. Renewable Energy essentially takes used cooking oils and turns them into high-quality, low-carbon fuels that can be used in conventional diesel engines without any modifications, and they state that their comparative advantage is the following: “We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks in most of our facilities provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those relying primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils”.

The Renewable Energy Group also makes solutions for heating and power generation, although this is not their main product. REGI is one of the bigger names in the renewable energy sector with a market cap of 3.76 billion, and the company may see increased demand for its clean energy solutions as the US is now turning away from conventional fossil fuels under a rapidly evolving political climate. Under Joe Biden’s new $1.9T stimulus proposal, he includes tax credits for renewable energy infrastructure, and that will no doubt benefit Renewable Energy Group as they mention in their last 10K: “we opened our first REG branded fueling station adjacent to our biorefinery in Seneca, Illinois to serve a variety of customers from trucking fleets to local diesel vehicle owners”. But the biggest advantage that REGI may have as a renewables/biodiesel company is their infrastructure in Europe. Despite being headquartered in the Rust Belt, REGI has significant operations to supply clean energy to Europe: “In addition, we have established an international distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout Europe. Our products that are produced in Europe and in the U.S. are distributed to European customers using seas vessels, barges and trucks. Our Emden biorefinery has deep-water capabilities and can load vessels, barges and trucks… We also have storage facilities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, which allows us to distribute our products efficiently.”

This will be a blessing for their sales as the European Union remains a huge proponent of biodiesel as a higher percentage of consumer automobiles in the region function on diesel rather than gasoline, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, [biodiesel consumption is only projected to decline by 6%.](http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2517090/2020-eu-biodiesel-production-remains-stable-consumption-down-6)

However, REGI is located in a relatively new sector which isn’t entirely supported to the same degree that the battery/electric based industries are. Many competitors are looking to make an impact and take advantage of the clean energy demand, and REGI will have to stand out financially to be considered as a stellar investment. With that, let’s take a look at the company’s finances and compare it to the rest of the sector.

REGI Main Competitors:

* Archer Daniels Midland Company
* Cargill Incorporated
* Louis Dreyfus
* Commodities Group 
* Ag Processing Inc.

&#x200B;

Taking a look at their balance sheet, you’ll notice a relative decline in total debt, and that’s combined with a solid increase in assets which brings about a favorable current ratio. You’ll notice that PP&E is also increasing as their operations expand. The company’s ability to pay off debt likely won’t be damaged as their debt coverage based on profits alone is great. They’ve seen a significant increase in receivables in 2019, so they may be extending too much debt to their consumers and this may hurt cash flows. However, since their debt is so low they can likely do this and still maintain enough liquidity. 

Looking into the income statement, we see that the company’s revenue and gross profit has been on a steady increase, except in 2017 where the trade war with China (which likely also won’t happen again under Biden) probably damaged the cost of goods due to increased soybean prices, but the effects of geopolitics are expected to impact commodities-based companies. EBITDA has also steadily increased over the years. No red flags appear on the historical income statements and even OpEx has managed to remain stable despite growing revenues which will create a very satisfactory bottom line. Every major profit/income metric has been increasing, including cash per share. The three main profit metrics (Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income) for this company should satisfy investors, as this area has stayed very consistent from 2015 to 2020.

REGI has seen a meteoric 264% rise in the past 6 months and still maintains an ultra-low Price/Earnings ratio of 9, and a Price/Sales ratio of 1.46, significantly below the industry rivals even in traditional energy, and a P/E ratio of just half of $ADM, a soybean processing company. REGI maintains a current ratio of around 3, which means assets exceed liabilities by a factor of three. This balance of liquidity and a relatively low P/E and, let’s face it an attractive name for most retail investors (“Renewable Energy” would immediately grab the eye of any average retail investor --- remember the Zoom fiasco?) primes it to continue on its recent uptrend. 

**The Future**

Government regulation in the energy sector is inevitable, especially with climate change affecting the world every day. President Biden has promised to combat this by taking swipes at fossil fuels, recently freezing a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Expect many more moves like this to come in the near future as the new administration encourages an exodus from conventional fossil fuels. 

REGI must see this opportunity and capitalize on it. Investing in new biodiesel stations and striking deals with trucking companies to provide them fuel would go a long way for the company. Targeting the trucking market is the best bet for REGI, as electric vehicle makers dominate the consumer automobile market when it comes to non-petroleum cars.  However, due to the long distance nature of trucking, biodiesel comes in superior, as electric vehicles fare better when driving smaller distances. According to the Diesel Technology Forum, about 70 percent of all the nation’s freight is moved by diesel, and nearly all highway freight trucks have diesel powered engines. All diesel vehicles, whether it be lightweight, medium, and heavy vehicles are capable of running biodiesel fuel, according as stated by the Alternative Fuels Data Center. Coupled with the matter of 78 % less CO2 emission than diesel, and biodiesel suddenly starts to seem like a much superior alternative to diesel for trucking companies. 

Currently, biodiesel is currently more expensive than diesel, likely due to storage costs for biodiesel. With new government regulations expected very soon, however, the price of natural diesel will inevitably go up. This will likely lead to trucking companies using more biodiesel than in the past. Another plan REGI could indirectly benefit from is government incentives. The new administration offering tax breaks to companies for using environment friendly energy methods is a likely possibility. Another thing to keep in mind is that biodiesel isn’t necessarily going to be used for transportation and since most investors are currently focused on battery-based platforms and solar energy, don’t expect an EV-like runup. Biodiesels are far more likely to be used for things outside of consumer transport, as most cars still operate on gasoline and the transition to clean energy for consumer transport is looking to go more into the electric side which discounts biodiesel there anyway. Despite this, REGI has seen great revenue and profit growth and with limited trade wars in the future, their COGs should remain low. On top of this, REGI’s vertical integration of the supply and distribution chains coupled with their global network will surely lead to more investors piling on to this low-competitor industry. REGI is poised to take over biodiesels, and with their current valuation, the stock has potential to still double._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Edge computing is the future. How to capitalize on it?

The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.

That outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone help explaining what’s happening to UGE.

The company owns a monopoly in the pre-load app space, has a lot of exciting growth opportunities, and is a great **long-term** buy. The stock is up over 650% over the past 12 months, so the valuation does seem stretched, but I could see the stock going to $100 within the next 6-12 months if the next few earnings calls don’t disappoint. 

Super long post, TLDR on the bottom. 

**What Does Digital Turbine Do?** 

* Digital Turbine has created digital software called **Ignite** and its flagship product **Dynamic Installs** (70% of revenue) automatically pre-loads apps onto the phone for the Android market ONLY. Basically, if you buy a new Android device and you see Uber or Starbucks installed when you first boot up the phone, Digital Turbine is likely the company behind that.
* Digital Turbine has **additional products (30% of revenue)** including: 
   * **Wizard** \- a pop-up menu that shows up and asks users if they want to add apps onto their phone when booting up a new phone 
   * **SingleTap** \- a patented digital ad technology that allows users to frictionlessly download apps with one-click instead of having to go through multiple steps on the App Store 
   * **Notifications** that pop on the user’s home screen recommending apps or content 

**Business Model** 

* The power of Digital Turbine’s business model comes from its **extensive partnerships.** The company has multi-year **EXCLUSIVE** contracts with many of the major phone **carriers** like Verizon and AT&T, **OEMs** like Samsung and LG, and advertisers which consist of **70% of the top apps** on Google Play. 
* To give you an example of how Digital Turbine makes money, let’s imagine Lyft wants to gain users on Android devices. Lyft could spend $100 marketing on Facebook or Snapchat to get new users but then they’re competing with the hundreds of thousands of other apps spending on ads, OR they could approach Digital Turbine and get a guaranteed number of pre-loaded apps onto phones for that same $100. Digital Turbine touts this to give companies a **much better ROI.** 
   * Roughly a third of the revenue paid by an advertiser goes to the carrier, a third to the OEM, and a third to Digital Turbine 
* Carriers and OEMs earn money from advertisers **without much work on their end,** while app developers are able to **access millions of Android devices** as long as their app is a good fit for the phone buyer 
* To give you a sense of scale for the business, Digital Turbine to date has delivered **4.2 billion apps,** has its software on more than **500 million phones,** and is adding more than **20 million new devices each month** 

**Growth Prospects** 

* Macroeconomic / secular trends 
   * Though most US users love their iPhones the Android market actually dominates with an **80%+ market share worldwide,** and this is not likely to change any time soon 
   * Due to COVID-19, a lot of retail stores had to shut down, which resulted in less new phone sales, which means less revenue for Digital Turbine. With the return of the economy and with **the next wave of 5G phones** which will push customers to upgrade phones, the next few years look favorable for the company 
* Mobile Posse
   * The company acquired Mobile Posse, which provides carriers like Verizon and OEMs like Samsung the ability to show phone users third party content through two products: 
      * **firstAPP** which aggregates different media content and is shown right when a user unlocks the phone 
      * **firstPAGE** which shows media content when a user opens the browser 
   * The transaction closed in February 2020 and is a great complementary add to Digital Turbine for 3 reasons: 
      * The deal was extremely fair in price. Mobile Posse was acquired for $66 million but $24.5 million of that is an estimated earn-out. With the company having generated $59 million in 2019 revenue, the company was purchased **just over 1x revenue which in my opinion is a steal** considering the company has a 5-year CAGR of 48% and is profitable 
      * This acquisition makes Digital Turbine’s entire ecosystem more attractive to its partners by **extending its product offerings throughout the life of the phone by being able to constantly show users content and ads.** Mobile Posse’s content products will now consist of around a third of Digital Turbine’s revenue which is great because it decreases the company’s dependence on app pre-loads.  
      * One of Mobile Posse’s primary carrier partners is **T-Mobile** which recently merged with **Sprint**, and this is the **last major US carrier** that Digital Turbine doesn’t have major business with. According to the latest earnings call, the CEO remains upbeat about signing T-Mobile and Sprint as partners, and the acquisition of Mobile Posse helps makes Digital Turbine more likely to sign on the carrier, which means more devices and an even stronger partnership network. 
* International expansion 
   * The third and most powerful opportunity for growth is international expansion. Currently, North America revenue accounts for roughly 65% of the company’s sales, but the **real golden opportunity lies beyond in developing countries where Android is the dominant player.** 
   * In December 2018, Digital Turbine signed on Samsung as a partner, which paved the way for the company to sign on Telefonica, Telecom Italia, America Movil, Millicom, and AT&T Mexico in the past 1-2 years. Basically, this means Digital Turbine now **partners with 2/3 of the OEMs in Latin America and an estimated 80% of mobile subscribers through carriers** 
   * The company also has a partnership with Reliance Jio, which covers 25% of the 1 billion mobile subscribers in **India** and has a partnership with Xiaomi which could lead to partnerships in **China** 
   * All of this is to say that Digital Turbine is truly in the beginning stages of its international expansion, and I believe as investors are starting to see the company successfully execute, it’s beginning to draw more attention and hence why it’s stock has shot up over the past year 

**Financials** 

* In the latest quarterly earnings report, the company reported **quarter over quarter revenue that is up 116%** which is inflated due to the Mobile Posse acquisition but on a **combined company basis, sales grew by 53%.** 
* The company also grew **recurring revenue from 10% in the previous year to 40%** which is a really good sign because it means revenue will be more reliable moving forward 
* The company also reported **43% gross margin** in the quarter as compared to 39% in the previous year, another great sign 
* Company has just about as much debt as cash (\~$17mm) and is **profitable and cash-flow positive** 

**Risks & mitigations** 

* First, is the **valuation**. Digital Turbine has experienced some explosive growth over the past year and in order to justify its share price, the company needs to execute well especially with its international expansion which is always tricky    
   * However, I do think the management team has shown that it has been making all the right moves and I think the path to future growth as I laid out earlier in the video will lead to some nice surprise developments in the next few years 
* Second, in its 10K, one of the biggest risks is that **carriers or OEMs may start building their own services** to work with advertisers, and if a big customer like Verizon or AT&T were to pull out their contracts, that would really hurt the company like when TikTok pulled from Fastly. 
   * I think Digital Turbine is aware of this risk and that’s why it’s working hard to diversify its revenue stream by strengthening its product offerings through the acquisition of Mobile Posse and expanding internationally 
* Lastly, there’s some criticism that Digital Turbine products are **bloatware**, and this would only be a problem if customers actually were turning away from devices because of the pre-loaded apps and home screen products Digital Turbine provides 
   * Customers can always turn off any of Digital Turbine’s products and delete pre-loaded apps but more often than not, customers end up utilizing the company’s products in one form or another 

**What I’m Doing** 

* I’ve started a small position in the company a few weeks ago and plan to **hold for the next few years** 
* Valuation looks a bit overstretched so I wouldn’t bet the farm on it at these prices but if the stock does have any major dips, I am going to treat them as major buying opportunities 
* **Company’s earnings report is on February 3rd,** which will be really interesting to see what happens. Last quarter, the company reported strong earnings but the stock dropped 16% and rebounded quickly 
* **If the stock dips to the $30s or $40s, that would be an ideal great time to buy**

**TLDR:** Company owns a monopoly in the Android pre-load app space with partnerships with the largest carriers and OEMs in the world not named Apple; lots of good growth prospects including its recent acquisition + international expansion. Expensive stock fundamentally right now but good one to keep an eye on if there are any major dips. Strong buy in the $30s-40s. Medium buy in the $50s.

&#x200B;

Tencent already owns major parts of the digital entertainment market, and has stakes in other studios, including Blizzard-Activision. While EA would be a tough buy, Take-Two would be an easier target to purchase.

&#x200B;

While for the gaming market and gamers in general, this bring a loom of another generation of nickle and dime games, there's a second aspect that I feel isn't brought up: market monopoly and control. How often do governments prevent the sale of a private or traded company to a Chinese entity? To prevent the control of a resource or the disruption of free market in favor of exclusive exports to China? I remember the case of Potash Corp - about 7-10 years ago - where the Canadian government had to step in out of fear the mine would be exploited and the raw material all sent back to China with a disregard for the free market and demand.

&#x200B;

Then why are government letting software and entertainment companies being sold? Most IT and telecom hardware companies out of China are banned on network equipment and as government vendors. Digital entertainment has as much if not more reach on devices. Given - network hardware is a much greater threat as it can bring down entire communication networks, but contaminated devices are just as useless once bricked. 

&#x200B;

If TikToc was such a *great* threat, why is Call of Duty, WoW, Clash of Clans on the same list? They're all owned (in part or entirely) by Tencent. Tell me, how many PlayStation and Xbox are on US army bases world wide? And just in the "known" bases? Okay - you could say this is crazy thinking, which it probably is, but the question remains: why allow Chinese take over of software while preventing hardware?

&#x200B;

We know GME absolutely ripped in Friday due to gamma hedging. Some old shorts covering could have been the main reason behind the ignition switch but I am not very confident about that.

GME is already ripping in pre-market and I don't know what's triggering that. Maybe it's retail euphoria.

Looks like we will continue to have gamma squeezes, tweets from Papa Cohen etc until shorts are forced to cover and close most of their shorts. I am changing my thesis. I thought we will see a slow TSLA-esque short-covering in GME. Looks like we are setting up for something much quicker.

Thanks !_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you keep updated with your investments especially in ETFs? It is my understanding that if you invest in an ETF you are investing in the combined wealth of a number of companies. With so many in an ETF how do you all keep updated with a particular companies performance?

For example I am in the ARKK ETF, green energy and an UK/EU one too. Some of these have 40+ companies. I balance them weekly, but when one looks like it isn't going to do so great over the coming months I'd probably want to change that one out.

At the moment I am set up for alerts via investing.com and proactive investors where I can get email alerts about individual companies, but I was wondering if there is a better way to stay updated?

Thanks in advance for any help._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Have there ever been "bubbles" that simply haven't popped? Here I define "bubble" as any asset that has gone up at least x10 in price within a year.

Hello,

I have some experience in investing in shares but I've not invested in CFDs before. 

In the UK, it seems like you can't buy call options in US stocks, but can only buy CFDs in relation to call options. Am I right in saying, while CFDs in general are risky, the exposure you have on CFDs for call options are limited to the amount invested (i.e. the same as the call options themselves)? 

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "Tourism Recovery Portfolio": When to switch to what I actually want? Hi,

starting in april I bought lots of stocks that were hard-hit by COVID (as I bet that we would get a vaccine eventually):

DAL

Boeing

Airbus

Sabre Corp

LUV

Marriott

MGM

and I'm currently wondering when to sell these and rebuild my portfolio with what I actually want.

As these are all cyclical tourism stocks (basically), the highs should generally be in August.

But since we will be fighting COVID for a good while longer, I guess it will take at least until Summer 2022 for them to regain their previous highs (hopefully)

These stocks are nowhere close to being recovered but I'm feeling FOMO as the stocks that I want to buy are just rising year after year (MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN basically)

Any opinion on this? What is your take, much appreciate

I also expect that the entire market will do a pullback at one point in 2021, and that will drag my stocks down as well..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It is going to be really weird when the market is going to be back to 8-10% per year... Market went up ballistically since the bottom of March.

High beta stocks became extremely high beta stocks. And especially on the way up.

Watch out when everyone runs for the exit.

In this very volatile market there is money to be made. Call it luck or skills, things went very well for me. And not even a GME / NIO / TSLA shares or calls were bought. Most of it was sector picking and steady grind with proper risk management. So I am not a bear, bitter, or anything.

&#x200B;

But at some point, the music is going to stop. I am not saying a crash is coming, but the market can’t do 20% per year up with higher and higher PE forever. Stocks at 100-1000 PE or even negative PE can’t do 5x to 10x per year forever. So at some point, things will be quite different.

&#x200B;

Enjoy while you can, but make sure to understand that this market is (1) not normal, and (2) when the market is back to normal, the current trading style won’t work anymore. And will even generate heavy losses.

&#x200B;

It is very important to understand that when the reversion to the mean occurs and the market will be at a 8-10% per year (potentially lower given the recent run up), all of those very high beta stocks are going to fall from the sky. The same way earning money on the way up was easy, losing money on the way down will be even easier, especially if you hold the bag.

&#x200B;

Be very cognizant of the market and your current trading style, and be ready to adapt very quickly when the market will behave differently. It can take few weeks to turn the tide.

&#x200B;

When the wave is gone and the tide is low, it is easy to spot who swam naked. So watch out for the tide.

In the meantime, enjoy the ride!

Edit: for the sarcastic folks. We have been trading for a while, so what I said is not rocket science. This post was made for the many noobs who started trading recently, often from RH, and yoloing into meme stock not knowing exactly what they are doing. Experience of others cannot be taught, it has to be lived. And probably it will fall on deaf ears anyway. They will try to do the same trades they just learned over and over, even as it won’t work, and loss will accumulate.

S_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Calls and puts Honestly I don’t understand them. I get that it’s a promise to sell 100 shares of something. What I don’t understand is how the price per share ends up being 23 cents or 12 cents etc. while the market price is like 3,4,10 dollars. It’s just weird. And if I have 100+ shares of a certain stock, is it even worth selling calls for them? Or should I just trade them normally? Also why do the calls and outs options say $2 $3 $7 etc. none of it makes sense for some reason and I’ve watched a billion fuckin videos but I feel like an idiot for not understanding this and it’s making me pretty mad tbh._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is A Company Selling Stock Supposed to be this Expensive? I'm looking into this company and they sold shares worth 4 million, (market cap around 100 million), and from that 4 million, the underwriters got to keep 16% in cash, shares and warrants, then another $47,000 dollars worth of those shares were made available for insiders to purchase. At the time of this announcement (dec 17) the stock was trading around $0.9 for a few weeks, and the offering was at $0.47, so they get to buy the stock at almost half price (if that's when the shares were offered, the stock had run up a lot in Nov)

Are both of these things normal - 16% fees for issuing shares seems steep to me, and the insiders giving themselves a big discount (although it's not a massive amount). Seems like a bad deal for the company and shareholders, but I've never dug into the details of this stuff before, so I don't really know.

I have some questions about employing a long call on a pre-revenue company - [Nano-X Imaging (NNOX)](https://robinhood.com/stocks/NNOX)

I am very, very bullish on this company. Since their IPO in May they are up 230% to a share price of $67.50, and a valuation of $2.42 Bn (as of 9:30pm PST). Of course, with this company being pre-revenue the only thing that has caused the stock price to increase to this level is investor speculation and excitement.
They are due for FDA approval some time in the first half of the year, and are looking to deploy products to hospitals in the third or fourth quarter.
I believe that they will achieve these goals.

I am a relatively new investor, I don't really employ options as a part of my portfolio. 
I absolutely love watching the chaos of WSB, especially recently, but the inherent volatility of options make them less attractive for my investment strategy.
That being said, I think purchasing a couple of NNOX long call options would be a successful calculated risk.
I am thinking of purchasing options at the strike price of $55 expiring on August 20, or December 17. 
I've also thought of buying options at a strike price of around $90 as I can see the stock reaching this towards the end of this year - the price is significantly cheaper for the option contract itself BUT its inherently more risky. 

As I said, I've never really dabbled with options - much less long options. I'm hoping to get some advice, suggestions... really any general information or input from people's personal experiences with long options. 
Successes, failures, lessons learned, anything. I want it all!!

Today is Sunday (market closed). This morning in Vanguard, I sold all my other stocks to go into the big GME ride tomorrow at opening. So, I sold about $35k in 7 "other" stocks, and turned around and put that $35k into GME. I got a message that I've got before paraphrasing: "you don't have enough funds as of now, make sure you get enough in place...yada, yada, yada".

As long as the "other stocks" sell at market opening, I will have the funds. 

I went on Vanguard this evening to check the transaction status, and the status for the 7 "other" stocks i'm selling shows as "open", while the 527 shares of GME show as "pending". I am worried because it said somewhere that pending deals can take 1-3 business days (!) IF approved.

I'm sorry if i'm overthinking this, please help me with these couple questions - 

 - If the deal takes 1-3 days to get approved, am i locked in at the current $65/share, or is it at whatever the price is at 1-3 days from now?

 - Can anyone weigh in on if there is any risk of the deal not getting approved? I have triple checked the math there will be enough funds from the "other" stock sale to cover the big GME purchase. 

 - Currently, it's all in one transaction for 527 shares. If there's risk of it not getting approved, would it be better to cancel this transaction before opening tomorrow and split it up into 5 transactions @ 105 shares/ea?

I get a sense from watching the market in the past years and company fundamentals matter less and less. Seems like as of late you make gains by simply riding the wave of investor sentiment regardless of where the long term road leads. Oddly enough, this sentiment, which often seems irrational, seems to be propping up companies with failed business models since those companies can cash out on the stock gains.

They are a *security company*. Revenue does not care about your AI driven autonomous machine learning EV car with DDs. People are using these terms loosely. A quick lookup for interviews with John Chen would prove that he explicitly avoids these terms as they do not define nor matter to the products/revenue of BlackBerry. QNX revenue does not depend on any of these terms, it's on installation on any device. This includes the space station, of which there is 1 of with obviously non-recurring revenue. Buying based on these basis would be gambling.

**Bull**:

* Business transformation: BlackBerry is now a software company, starting the transformation in 2015. The focus is security, the general term.
* 5 Products:  

   * QNX: Embedded system OS.  

      * Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
      * Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
      * Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
      * Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
      * Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.
   * QNX Hypervisor: Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization  

      * SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
      * Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.
   * IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.  

      * What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
      * Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
      * Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
      * Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
      * 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
      * Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.
   * Spark: Endpoint management. Basically API security. Did not delve far into this, basic info.  

      * Unified Endpoint Security: This is the endpoint where a laptop/phone/IoT device hits. It provides encryption and security around that. Continuous authentication is a part of it, where a device is learning the user behavior using ML and continuously checking if the behavior matches the original owner; if not, lock the device.
      * Unified Endpoint Management: Basically managing your API for devices.
      * Zero trust: I think this is specifically talking about continuous authentication. Basically, it's not an authenticate once and forget it. It's constantly tracking behavior to verify the user is the authenticated user.
   * AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system.  

      * Target customers: Government, healthcare, education, etc.
      * Solution: A communication system targeting non-enterprise businesses; specifically for Event management, cross organizational communication/collaboration, mass notifications.
      * Who does this benefit? You've seen the hacks in healthcare/educational/governmental sector. This is specifically for them.
   * SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).  

      * End to end encryption.
      * Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
      * Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.
* Customer oriented solutions: As you've seen in the products above, some products overlap and are just names to target specific customers. It allows customers to easily understand what product could solve their issue. Continuous authentication is a great example of this: Their customer complained that they kept re-authenticating, so they designed a solution allowing them to authenticate once and using ML they learned their behavior and can continuously check if the user is the owner/authenticated user. This kind of passion in leadership is good for business.
* Liability: QNX has the highest security rating available. Most CEOs want to avoid liability when it comes to security, using QNX would help them avoid that in a similar way cloud services help them avoid being blamed for hacking.
* Leadership: BBs leadership isn't one to play on famous words to drive the stock up. John Chen explicitly states this in his interviews and says they are a security company. Not cyber, doesn't mention AI or whatever. He explicitly avoids meme words and understands what the point of BBs business is.

Where I think growth can be made:

1. QNX in more cars. They can capitalize on the idea of less ECUs = less cost for OEMs + security.
2. IVY usage by OEMs along with QNX.
3. IVY ecosystem. Maybe application billing?
4. Professional services (support) for the products listed.
5. AtHoc increased market share in more governmental/healthcare/educational entities.
6. SecuSUITE for more enterprise customers with the idea being saving employers money from purchasing work phones for employees, and worrying about securing them.

**Bear**:

* Revenue: It is not yet based on a subscription/usage basis. You can only produce so many cars, and they don't give an insight on how much do they charge per car for QNX. Anywhere from $2 - $20 is what was mentioned in transcripts. This is a growth area, but not at a trajectory that's excellent. IVY does work on a subscription/usage basis, but IVY can be used WITHOUT QNX. I'm worried about this, but still see it as an area that will generate revenue in the range of $400 MM - $600 MM at the price of $20 per 30M cars. The 30M per year is based on the listing of their customers and their yearly production rates. Keep in mind I stated any device, this does not include trucks or other IoT devices.
* Market share: These are relatively new products. J.P. Morgan pointed this out as a priority for growth. This could end up not working out and growth never happens. This is a relatively low risk due to QNX and IVY providing SO MUCH value for car manufacturers Vs. other products in the market.
* Patent revenue: They sold a chunk of their no longer relevant patents to Huawei. This makes up a small (<= 32%) of their revenue and is a one time sale. The coming quarter could be equal or less to the last quarter revenue due to either other sales making up the lost revenue from patents, or coming up short. It could come higher if they sold more services, but due to COVID and knowing that many car manufacturers have lowered their production due to chip shortage, the next quarter will most likely be lower.
* VW.os: VW is making their own OS. VW.os is what they're calling it. They're currently using QNX, but that revenue could potentially stop. Personally I don't believe VW is capable of doing that. It's a marketing hype. Their companies are not capable of good collaboration or good implementation based on what I've read and researched (can't find article right now), but it's something to be concerned about.
* QNX success: While IVY could be using QNX, it does NOT depend on it. There is potential for OEMs to use IVY without QNX. I think this is a low risk, but still risk. 19 OEMs are already using QNX.
* Lack of Answers: I can't get much out of their earnings call. They don't delve into pricing for QNX, how they plan to grow it besides getting more car manufacturers and more cars post Corona. How they plan to do recurring revenue. A breakdown of each revenue segment would be helpful, but I don't see that either and there is hesitancy to delve into it.

**Prediction**: I think QNX can become a $1B revenue per year alone. $2B revenue per year as a company is not far fetched. Without a subscription/usage based model, it is difficult to see how growth can go beyond that. BB is good in 2-5 years, not this year. I can see their revenue growing to potentially $2B - $4B revenue per year. They did mention trying to figure out a subscription/usage based billing, if done then the revenue would be much higher. I think $18 is a fair price on the high end. It could grow further than that, but expectations would be HIGH.

Another option is to wait for a red day then buy some and DCA from there.

Finally and the route I plan to go. I'm going to start selling puts on stocks I want to buy, 10% OTM monthlies and just wait until I get assigned. It'll be a similar DCA situation where i'll sell cash secured puts worth half the cash I have. If I get assigned, i'll do another round of put selling at a lower strike price. 

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did ARK add 790,000 shares of TSM after Intel's earnings report? TSM has been steadily going up last two weeks partly due to the speculation that Intel is going to announce handing over more manufacturing over to TSM while Intel focuses on design.

On 1/21, Intel had their earning's call and delivered [this message](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/24/why-intel-stock-spiked-then-crashed-last-week-afte/):

>Gelsinger reiterated that while Intel may move some products to outside foundries (such as its new GPUs), the "majority of 2023 products" – likely referring to 7nm processors -- would still be done in-house.

Market interpreted this as Intel not significantly changing their strategy -- i.e. no big additional orders for TSM. So both Intel and TSM stock dropped ($134 to $129).

However, ARK actually added significantly to their TSM position between 1/21 - 1/22, adding 790,000 shares. This is one of the biggest one day buys they've ever done for TSM. And I don't think this is just them "buying the dip" either, since TSM was just $118 a few days ago, they could've easily waited a few more days to see if TSM would drop more.

So I wonder if ARK interpreted the Intel information differently than the market? What did they like about that Intel call?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What percentage of savings is wise to invest?

Thanks a lot_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Current ideas I have on my stock list (non-tech ideas) I say non tech because I have zero clue how to value tech and I don't want to use my time to catch up with an industry that changes every few days. I'm not smart enough to figure most of these tech companies out.

\-Ingles Markets ($IMKTA): 5.3x EV/EBIT (18.86% earnings yield) with slow but steadily growing gross margins and growing returns on equity and invested capital. I'll take the Buffett approach on this one. Their returns don't have to be sky high but I want them to be consistent, that way returns can compound at a given rate and snowball into larger returns given time. However I see some interesting things with them. One board member founded Newcastle Partners (private equity buyout firm) and another one used to run Wachovia, now Wells Fargo. Another board member is also a CPA and the current CEO is from the Ingle family outright. Now this is nothing extraordinary in its own right per se. A lot of executive committees have CPAs and investment industry guys there. They raised their dividend this past year, they don't seem to be trying to grow aggressively (they more or less can't because their operating area is so small, just the southeastern part of the U.S. with one store in VA and one in AL). Are they trying to put themselves up for sale? There is some consolidation that can happen in the grocery industry, they own their own milk processing operations and all of their stores are within 280 miles of their warehouse in Asheville, NC. I checked to see who else may own them and Gabelli owns 14.0% of their class A shares (class B shares aren't publicly traded). Why does it matter if Gabelli owns it? I know his investing style. What would the company go for if it went private today and he looks at cash flows. If it gets cheaper I may jump in. 3.7x EV/EBITDA, 4.9x P/E, 15.87% FCF yield (inverted their EV/FCF of 6.3x to get that percentage). They're gushing cash but why? I have yet to figure out the markets reasons for it.

&#x200B;

\-Lancaster Colony Corp ($LANC): 27.3x EV/EBIT (3.66% earnings yield), this one is probably going to stay on my watchlist for a long time because they're richly valued but they're also a great business. They make Olive Garden and Chick fil-A take home sauces and dressings and so on. They also do frozen breads. Concentrated revenue streams with their biggest customers being 56% of sales last fiscal year. Contracts for their work are filled in 30 days but their work is filled in 5-10 days. Both $LANC and $IMKTA have around the same gross margins but due to the nature of their operations, different ROCEs. $LANC is sporting 20%+ ROCEs for 10 years. Their business is nothing fancy and it's sort of boring but their customer base is addicted to sauces and dressings. They do Buffalo Wild Wings takehome sauces also. I don't see their market leaving them anytime soon. 21.5x EV/EBITDA, 36.0x P/E and 1.91% FCF yield. It's richly valued but I'm going to keep watching it just in case they get cheap.

&#x200B;

\-Sally Beauty Holdings ($SBH): 10.5x EV/EBIT (9.52% earnings yield), I've been digging into theirs a bit more because in the midst of a seemingly overvalued market they seem to be fairly priced. Seems. I haven't figured out why they're fairly priced. The cosmetics sector has high gross margins and $SBH is no exception with margins well over 48% for the past 10 years. Leadership isn't exactly stellar, they have a lot of retail locations with a lot of inventory which I imagine dampens pricing power (if you have to fill your stores up with a variety of products just so you can make one sale then I don't imagine you have a lot of pricing power, I can be wrong on that understanding though). They sell professional salon products to professional stylists so their customer base is more varied than Jane Doe at the mall winging a purchase because money is burning a hole in her wallet. Their auditor mentioned critical matters such as vendor rebate concessions and they mention in their risk factors section that product diversion is a large issue (when Jane Doe gets her hands on professional grade products or tools, that's a bad thing. "You shouldn't be able to get that". It's bad because it leads to brand erosion and in the beauty industry brand is everything). They've been taking some restructuring charges against operating income so I'll have to adjust for that over the past few years and try to normalize earnings to the best of my ability but I think they can be a good opportunity to get into the cosmetics industry for a potentially fair or cheap price. Their industry consolidates quickly and I wouldn't be surprised to see them buying out other companies given enough time and enough industry pressures to do so. 7.5x EV/EBITDA, 13.9x P/E, 10.98% FCF yield._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there anything that I can invest in that gives me higher chances than the lottery? But also FAST turnaround? I’m 25, my whole youth and life has been a waste, I don’t care about my old ass in the future, if I even make it that long.

I have $10,000 in savings but no direction in life, and interest from the bank is a joke, like a few cents a month.

I have a worthless job where full time is maybe $300 a week. I don’t even consider it a real job, because the tasks are meaningless and $300 a week isn’t a living wage.

I feel like at this point, winning the lottery is the only way I can get the life I want, especially to get a life while I’m still in my 20s (I’m 25 now, half of my 20s are gone, complete waste of misery and loneliness, nothing meaningful gained).

It seems everything that has potential (and still NEVER ANY GUARANTEE) requires years of work, just for the CHANCE of financial stability, and if you’re lucky, actual fulfillment in your career.

Laugh at me if you must, but I’ve never had a girlfriend or had sex. I haven’t had real friends since high school. I don’t care to continue living a celibate, single, lonely life, ESPECIALLY if I can’t do that in my own home affording my own necessities and hobbies (whatever those might turn out to be, if anything can really be enjoyable for more than a few minutes!)

In addition to simply wanting to be able to enjoy the rest of my 20s (before enjoying 30s and beyond) I’m also going to lose coverage from my parents health insurance when I turn 26 (about 11 months from now), and on several medications with SEVERE withdrawal risks, even if you taper really slowly (I did not know this until recently, but I was too young to refuse when made to take them anyway, and taking them has just been normal for me since).

I can’t believe how expensive healthcare and medications are out of pocket. 

I feel like the only CHANCE at success means delaying enjoyment of life, because it seems the only FAST turnarounds are COMPLETELY LUCK BASED (winning the lottery).

Scratch offs technically have better odds, but you’re still more likely to lose your money than win even a 6 figure amount, let alone millions.

I also understand if anyway to get rich quick was easy, it’d be oversaturated and probably not quick or easy anymore.

I was just wondering if instead of 401(k) and Roth or whatever that means you can live comfortably when you’re old (I’m considering ending my life before I even turn 26 if I haven’t found a way to at least afford to live on my own and afford my healthcare before I lose my parents insurance) there is anything I can invest in that at least has higher odds of a big return than the lottery, and not slowly over years, but a matter of months, if not overnight.

Just figured I’d ask in case it exists, while I’m still around._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Critique my Non-Taxable Portfolio I didn't start saving for retirement until maybe my 7th year of my career (I'm a lawyer).  Against others' advice, I focused on paying off my $280k in student loans before I started saving.  Today I'm debt free and own my \~$500k condo outright (paid it off a year ago).  Old 401k rolled over to an IRA which I manage myself, and my current job has a 401k with Vanguard.  Together these are my non-taxable accounts.  I plan to max out my 401k every year for at least the next 15 years, and then I have separate investments (taxable brokerage account, rental property, etc).  I am trying to set myself up for an early semi-retirement, but  want to avoid  tapping into any of my 401k/IRA retirement savings until I'm forced to start taking distributions.  I'm 37, so these investments will have about 33 years to grow and that's why I want them to be aggressive.  So here's what I'm interested in: I know everyone says to consider your portfolio as a whole, but I want to consider my non-taxable accounts separately because I know they are on a different time horizon.  I also know that many people are pro just investing in a handful of ETFs/funds and would probably balk at mine being "messy."  But throwing everything into VOO or VTI is just too boring for me and want to learn more about investing by doing.  I also have a few stocks in these accounts just to play around with some dividend stocks/REITs in my non-taxable account.  Anyway, seems like there's a lot of people out there who like to analyze and critique so, anyone who wants to, please let me know your thoughts.

I want to invest, but I don’t want to do anything illegal or unethical. I’m completely new to investing and want to get in on GME (but only by investing quantities I’m comfortable with losing), but it feels weird to me. Would I be doing anything legally or ethically wrong by investing in GME? (I know some random trader like me probably wouldn’t face legal repercussions even if the SEC found the whole thing to be totally wrong or whatever, but I am also worried about the “ethical” side of the issue.) Figured I’d ask you guys, since you would know better than me or the rest of Reddit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Since everyone seems to be an expert on gamma squeezes... OP for this post is https://www.reddit.com/user/infinitelimits00/ and he posted this on r/options

Let’s talk about the reverse gamma squeeze (should also really be known as a charm-gamma squeeze)...plus this is an r/options sub anyways so might as well introduce charm.

So I see a lot of people think they know what a gamma squeeze is lately from GME. And yea what most people are saying is correct, but what they don’t understand is gamma works in two directions. The defining feature of any stock that has undergone a “true” gamma + short combo squeeze is that when it drops, it NEVER makes a V-shape recovery. See KODK, QS, HTZ, NKLA, TLRY from years ago, even BYND from years ago. I mostly like to go long stocks since stocks usually go up anyways, but I do like calling tops of stocks for fun (see my post history - I got QS exactly right and HTZ by 1 day, also got ZM and SNOW perfectly right in my comments history). I’m not calling the top for GME, but I just want to introduce the concept of what happens when a gamma squeeze fails, since the reverse is nasty.

So the gamma squeeze idea that most people have is say the next week the 100 GME call is like 20 delta (just estimating to make it easier). If some random person bought a 20 delta call from a MM, the MM will buy 20 shares to stay delta neutral and this happens over and over again over the course of the day, and the idea is this will cause the stock to skyrocket if enough people buy these calls. However, here’s the part that’s important. If some news came out or if just GME never moves much, those calls decay in delta, called charm. So those 20 delta calls -> 0 delta and the MM has to then SELL back those 20 shares, suppressing the stock. The delta of options change with time too, not only with underlying price.

That is one problem people never mention when they think gamma squeezes or an infinite cycle. But the other real issue is MM are already short ITM calls which they have like close to +100 shares hedged agains those short nearly 100 delta calls per option. If the stock ever dropped through these long call strikes, those calls go from nearly 100 delta at one point to < 50 delta, which means MM need to sell 50+ shares/options to keep delta neutral. They would keep selling more and more if it continues to drop and stays below those previously long strikes. That’s often times why the downside puts are so expensive on these names because MM also can’t blindly sell those, known a reverse gamma squeeze would cause these stocks to potentially go down 20% in a day.

Anyhow, I wanted to explain the reverse gamma squeeze since gamma is bidirectional. This is why when stocks that undergo this gamma + short squeeze rise and then suddenly drop, they NEVER recover. How many zig-zag recoveries have you seen in these stocks? That’s actually the defining feature of a stock that has undergone a gamma squeeze. It’s when it reverse gamma squeezes, it’s over. Good luck with your GME plays. Like I said, I like calling tops just for fun since it’s more interesting anyways. I’ve done it with a bunch of names in the past. I don’t really have a feel for GME, but the only thing I know is if it ever has a big down day, it’s most likely over and you’ll actually rather sell that day then baghold or buy the dip (which goes against the conventional thinking, but is actually the defining characteristic for true gamma squeeze stocks)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Blackberry - Monetizing Car Data  

In 2016 Mckinsey issued a report called Monetizing Car Data. The report estimates the potential revenues when the cars are connected online. They said that the overall revenue pool from car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 - 750 billion by 2030.

Here is a breakdown of the possible revenue streams as per the report:

In-Car Sources of income (QNX Income):

1. OEMs selling the service to customers and advertisers paying for the data are among the business models that might contribute to the value of the data-enabled social driving experience, which is expected to have an estimated value of USD 7 - 8 billion by 2030.
2. High-tech giants are positioned to provide the fundamental car data analytics services that car OEMs and advertisers are willing to buy. In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications.
3. Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles, such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls)
4. Retailers and service centers are using car data analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their offerings directly to drivers
5. Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment, navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups).
6. Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies

Big data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):

1. Service providers offer data management services
2. Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data.
3. Automotive suppliers are developing the software and hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing, analyzing, and selling car data
4. Roadside assistance providers can collect and process distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts
5. Infrastructure operators, including billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their respective services

Customer willingness to pay for features – as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features – varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.

Germany (As per 2020 Sales):

QNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market

China (As per 2019 Car sales):

QNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7%

USA:

QNX Clients: More than 70%

\*\*New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures

\*\*GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system. We can exclude them as QNX clients for now.

**Back to customer willingness to pay per product/service:**

**1.Predictive maintenance services:**

Germany: 73%

USA: 73%

China: 76%

Paying customers for networked parking in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 31.9% of China

The majority prefer a One-time price at time of vehicle purchase of USD 300

**3. Predictive maintenance, and vehicle usage monitoring and scoring:**

Germany: 72%

USA:71%

China: 78%

Paying customers for predictive maintenance, monitoring, and scoring in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 32% of China

Willingness to pay for connected navigation:

Germany: 45%

USA: 28%

China:35%

Paying customers for connected navigation in QNX power car: 28% of Germany + 20% of USA + 14.7% of China

The majority prefer One-time payment to activate the service of USD 20

**FOR IVY solutions and products:**

Willingness to share data:

Germany: 92%

US: 93%

China:98%

As the report said, car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 by 2030. If we take a look at Goldman Sachs report about expected car sales by 2025

Emerging Markets: 78 Million cars

Developed Countries: 34 Million cars

If we assume that by 2025 every car powered by QNX would have the new QNX system ( They said the first one will launch in 2023) and if we apply the QNX market share above.

**QNX would power:**

32 Million cars in emerging markets

22 Million cars in developed markets

If QNX offered a bundle of $15/month (and $10 in emerging markets) tailored package for parking assistance and maintenance and other services in developed countries. and If we apply the willingness to pay numbers from the Mckinsey report

**QNX Potential Revenue from basic features package:**

Developed Countries: 22M \* 71% \* 15 \* 12 = $ 2.8Bn

Emerging Countries: 32M \* 78% \* 10\* 12= $ 2.9Bn

If you add up an estimate for the rest of the products it might provide and potential contracts it can have for IVY with several governments, It would be easy for Balckberry to reach 8-10 Bn in Sales by 2025._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How Much Big Tech Shares Prices Will Drop If I Sold $1M?

>Signs of bubbles are everywhere as stock prices jumped by a magnitude not seen since the dot-com era, new share listings boom, and Bitcoin, though volatile, continues its generally upward climb. But if company earnings fall short of expectations or the vaccine rollout falters, there’s a risk markets will lurch as investors take money off the table.

>Central bankers, from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jerome Powell on down, are well aware of the danger. Surging ­valuations—some investors call what’s happening “the everything rally”—have been too obvious to ignore. Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, and other leading central bankers, though taken to task about bubbles in markets in recent months, have played down the concerns. That’s in part because they’re mindful of the danger of closing the monetary spigot too quickly. Indeed, coming out of the last crisis a decade ago, policymakers in some economies were probably too quick to withdraw stimulus for fear of creating bubbles and ended up putting the brakes on the economic recovery.

>“Central banks [in advanced economies] are in a global liquidity trap,” says Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich. “The liquidity bazooka buys time and pushes up asset prices but has zero value in improving economic trend growth. Like a black hole, once you are in it, it is extremely difficult to get out. That’s where we are in central banking, we are in a liquidity black hole.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street 1987 - can anyone explain what's happening in Gekko's office?

In the meantime between pitches, Gekko is doing deals on the phone and has one of his trader buying stocks and stuff. Does anyone have any idea what's going on in this scene for a layman?

For example, is there a list of stocks which are being bought that you can filter by the price increase or the volume.  

If Apple, for example, was up 5% pre-market is there anyway to see that and also see whether other stocks are rising?

Q4 2020 Results expected on 03/10/2021

To be honest, I’m not sure how to read the financials of a clinical-stage pharma company.

You can look up the numbers by yourself and make your own decisions.

* **Stock Moving Events**:

1. 01/20 Closing of a recent offering at $2.6 a share.

Movement: Price dipped on 01/12 upon the news of offering. Quickly bought up on the same day; Price has increased 40% since 01/12.

1. 11/09/2020: announced Q3 2020 earnings and provided business update.

Movement: Price has been on a steady rise since 11/09. It rose to the $2.5 area in less than a month and it has been consolidating prior to Christmas. Price has been volatile from 12/22 until 01/12 the announcement of the offering.

MA10 and MA20 are extremely close for Jan, we can now see the MA10 departing MA20 and moving upward. Given the recent offering, I see $2.6 as a support and the market looks extremely bullish for this company.

* **Summary**:
* $CERC has some potential for a serious breakthrough with the company’s promising development in the 8 pipelines.
* CERC-002 is covid related and we can expect something major to happen in early 2021. It’s close to the end of the Phase 2 study and Phase 3 is on the horizon.
* Strong Institutional ownership with 29% of free float.
* Recent offering shows strong support at $2.6.
* As a clinical-stage pharma company, investing in the future also involves great risk. Do you own DD and make a conscious investment.

My positions:

400 shares at $2.9-$3.1

20+ $5 calls, with expiration from Mar to July.

I will average up along the way or buy the dip if it occurs.

It's giving my CRISPR vibes and comparing it to Compass Pathways IPO, I see some serious updside. You can't buy this on Robinhood yet, so get a real account on Fidelity or something before it hits the NASDAQ (Robinhood).

What are your thoughts on the Psychedelics? MindMed is also starting to take "candy flipping" into clinic trial to help patients. What a time to be alive.

MMEDF position: 1,000 shares and counting_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Last questions about GME before tomorrow's carnival Presumably GME will spike tomorrow morning, irrespective of any play on the part of the institutions holding shorts, assuming there are such institutions and they are not just conspiratorial reddit fantasies. Call it $70 to $90 high tomorrow. Then there may be a halt and a dip as some take gains. Call it $60 again. And this cycle may continue for a few days, as both retail and institutional buyers wait for the institutions with large short positions to buy back at the elevated price in order to cut their losses. My question: What is preventing the short holders from waiting, or from buying back only very slowly, i.e., disguising their buys within the cycle described above so that the price doesn’t exceed (call it) $75? One potential answer here would be that, if there are multiple institutions with short positions, each will want to exit before the others and so avoid the still more elevated price that would result from a major, single institutional exit from the short at \~$65 (i.e., each institution is afraid of being the last to yield to the loss); however, I imagine these large short holders realize that it will likely be much easier for them to coordinate the wait amongst themselves than it will be for a bunch of disparate retail and non-shorted institutional investors to coordinate the hold. So what, beyond a single institution’s making a very quick and stupid exit, would prevent the price from leveling off at about its current level before returning to earth? *Is there a timer on the institutions’ short play?*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
