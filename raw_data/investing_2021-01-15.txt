 FTSE (VWO) vs MSCI (IEMG) I've seen some talk on here about investing in emerging markets and a number of people mention VWO from Vanguard which follows the FTSE emerging market index.

I would like to point out IEMG and a key difference with the MSCI index they use.

MSCI categorizes South Korea as an emerging and as a result IEMG gives you over 15% exposure to SK.

FTSE classifies SK as developed so VWO gives you no SK exposure. VEA, their developed market fund does have SK exposure but only about 5%.

So if you want SK exposure in your emerging markets ETF, go with IEMG or another ETF thay uses the MSCI emerging markets index._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying $O on Margin For those who don't know, $O is a triple-net lease REIT that is considered rock solid with its track record of monthly dividends. Its annual dividend is currently sitting at 4.8%, while Robinhood's margin rate is 2.5% per year. I'm sure you see where this is going. I've leveraged this position 1.5x. With Robinhood's maintenance requirement of 25%, I don't see a margin call coming any time soon using only half of the available margin.

Normally I would do Norbert's gambit with my Canadian broker to convert a large sum like this, but since become a non-resident, they wont let me trade in my account, and I can't open any new accounts with other brokers either. In any case, I think doing the conversion in Canada may have some undesired tax consequences.

Long story short, I'm thinking it may make sense to transfer the money in the CAD account at a US broker, and do Norbert's Gambit that way. My Canadian investment broker had the option to hold both USD and CAD accounts, but I haven't seen much of that with the US brokers (Fidelity, Vanguard).

The new stores + new methods of shopping (drive up, pick up in store, Shipt acquisition) attracted me to their company and I've been a happy shareholder since.


I don't have many shares (12) but was considering selling out of all I have. I'm not sure if the thesis has changed (a quality company with a continuous dividend has a good plan forward with solid management) but the price makes me wary. The run up has been immense and even if I wanted to buy more of the company I cannot (Fair value is ~$90 IMO). The EPS and revenue have jumped but they took out a credit line "for insurance" then promptly gave it back in the same quarter which seems a little weird to me. They also made a case that their small format stores will be able to grow profits on a square foot basis which also seemed a little fanciful to me when everyone is still at home.


With the clear overvaluation of many companies ($TGT included) and the odd stimulus situation in the K shaped economy which might prevent people from shopping at target and coral them to cheaper discount stores or higher end retail, I'm not sure if it's good to keep holding on to this company.

​  


So I was thinking, instead of just doing my regular monthly deposits, I would start to only buy a specific covered call healthcare ETF (pays a monthly dividend)  


My idea is to have an overweight position (my entire portfolio has been overweight on healthcare and more secular growth trends for the last 5 years, so I wouldn't really be re-allocating money to another sector really)  


My reasons for this is that I want to be able to give my deposits a little extra juice, by injecting 9% gain a year just on my deposits, then I would only use the monthly income from the dividends to do purchasing of other positions.  


I'm not worried about being overweight on that, because it's an ETF in a sector I'm bullish on for the long term, I'm willing to average down as much as I have to, it will give me downside protection (at the cost of upside gains) due to it being a covered call ETF, and it pays a monthly dividend, so I can have access to the payouts more frequently.  


Essentially, I could buy a 100 shares of specific stock, and just start selling deep in the money calls to try to replicate the same situation, but I thought this just might be a lazier way, and maybe a little less volatile due to it being a basket of stocks instead of me picking one specific company.  


Anyone else overweight on covered call etfs?   


Other than being overweight, and being exposed to a specific sector, and reducing potential upside gains, what would be the biggest risks associated with this strategy?

JNJ jumped about 2% yesterday on positive but minimal laboratory data related to its early phase trials, which surprised me - it’s good news, for sure, but only in the sense that it didn’t report any safety concerns so far. Efficacy can’t be measured or really predicted until human trials (phase 3) report, since antibody levels aren’t necessarily comparable from one vaccine to another. 2% seemed like a pretty high swing considering the minimal impact this report has on the vaccine’s ultimate outcome, as well as Johnson & Johnson’s huge scope of products across many different divisions (Moderna, for example, jumped significantly when its phase 3 trials reported initially positive data - but they’ve never released a product to market, so this was their first big “win,” unlike an established pharma giant like JNJ).

BLU isn't just your typical lottery style investment. Here's why:

In 2020, they were expected to meet a very ambitious plateau of results on their latest anti-cough medication. What separates this new drug from existing drugs is it works on migraines, chronic cough and other hypersensitization disorders, all without the loss of taste. 

This drug goes beyond use for the average person targeting users coughing over 20 times per hour and over 32 times per hour. People with this condition obviously suffer greatly. This drug is attempting to solve this. 

In 2020, the stock dropped from $12 down to below $3 per share. This is because they barely missed their ambitious standard. Several analysts I've heard from believe the stock was oversold from missing their 1st tier ambitions because the drug fortunately reached very close and therefore is still extremely useful. Trials have been conducted and now the BELLUS team is about to present their results to a globally recognized medical symposium dedicated to this very issue. Here's a preview of the title of their presentation.

Title: BLU-5937, A Potent and Selective P2X3 Receptor Antagonist, Presents a Promising New Approach for the Treatment of Chronic Pruritus in Atopic Dermatitis Patients 
Details: The presentation will highlight preclinical data that support the potential efficacy of P2X3 antagonists in the treatment of atopic dermatitis-derived pruritus.

Now that this news is announced the stock is reaching a new 7 month high since the initial drop. I believe the people buying in now to cause this increase are a very small group of investors who are either close to this industry specific breakthrough or the analysts I spoke of earlier. 

Now looks like a great time to get in as it's just beginning it's recovery. One analyst gave a price target of all the way back to $12 or roughly a 300-400% increase.

Long-time Uranium investor here and was hoping I could get a few more interested about the sector. Please let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions. I really think this is a market that is going to explode over the next few years. 

**#1 - What happened in the last Uranium bull market?**

The  last uranium bull market took place between 2004-2007. The price of  uranium is measured by a metric called the "spot price" and between that  time period it grew from a price of $20/lb to $135/lb. The  extraordinary climb was triggered by a flood at the mine one of the  world's largest producers (Cameco). In this bull market valuations  exploded. You have names such as Paladin which went up 200x. This bull  was followed by "mini-bear" and "mini-bull" market where the supply  situation started to stabilize and investment in new mines went through  the roof until 2011. In this time period, uranium stocks went crazy.  Investors were making 20x their money with their worst picks and hedge  funds started manipulating the market with crazy money coming in and out  to play the market. Unfortunately, the party was short-lived and in  March 2011, a tsunami & earthquake struck Japan and triggered the  Fukushima nuclear disaster which obliterated the market overnight.

**#2 - What happened after Fukushima?**

After  the Fukushima disaster many countries around the world immediately  started the process of switching off their nuclear reactors and  diverting away from Nuclear energy. An industry that had experienced a  significant amount of investment had a lot of the demand dry up  overnight. Obviously in turn, equities plummeted, many companies went  bankrupt, and the sector was forever changed. After Fukushima, all the  miners were left with big supply gluts. They had predicted nuclear to  keep growing and instead they were struggling to find anyone to take  this excess material. As such, there has been virtually 0 investment in  new uranium mines since Fukushima and since 2011 the miners and the  utilities have been working through the existing inventory.

**#3 - So what has changed to signal a bull market is coming?**

This  is essentially a supply/demand story. I'm sure some of you have seen  the market action with oil where countries manipulate the supply/demand  and it has a huge effect on the price. In uranium, the producers have  spent years working through excess inventory and since the spot price  has stayed low, there has been no investment. 2018 was the first year on  record where the Uranium industry produced LESS than the annual demand  and this has continued for the last three years. At the same time,  demand is growing and Nuclear reactors are going up across the world.  China and other countries have several plants under construction and  Japan is restarting a lot of the plants it shutdown after Fukushima.  Additionally, the carbon reduction benefits of Nuclear are getting more  and more support from both political parties. Both the democrats and  republicans worked together (its possible!) to pass a couple bills  recently that have been very positive for the Uranium industry. These  included restricting how much cheap Uranium comes into the US and  establishing a national reserve of Uranium in the US for security  purposes. Overall, the macro sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and  barring another nuclear disaster, this commodity is only headed up.

**#4 - Black Swan/COVID**

If  the above isn't enough to get you excited, COVID has made this story  even more convincing and has acted as a "black swan" for this industry.  Because of COVID, the #1 and #2 producer in the world (Kazatomprom and  Cameco respectively) both shut down production in order to keep their  employees safe. So not only do you have an industry with a huge  structural supply deficit, but the #1 and #2 producers essentially  turned off the tap and decided they are not producing anymore. What  could make this even more compelling? Well, these two producers still  have contracts they have to fill and they need Uranium so instead of  producing it they are actually buying it from other companies on the  spot market to fulfill their needs. Can you imagine another industry  where the #1 and #2 producers decide to stop producing and instead start  buying from other companies? This further constricts supply and there  is currently no end in sight to some of the mine shutdowns (Cameco  specifically) that happened initially back in March due to COVID. So you have an industry with a big supply deficit, 0 investment in new mines,  the top 2 producers are currently shut down, the top 2 producers have  actually become buyers essentially arbitraging their own market and  nuclear energy is growing. I'll let you make your own conclusions as to where this ends up.

**#5 - How do I make money?**

This  industry is an extremely small industry. There are 2 (maybe 3)  companies that are considered largecap and the rest are very small  companies typically <$100M. Most of the companies would probably be  defined as penny stocks.  The good thing is that most of the companies  that are around today have managed to be prudent enough to survive the  bear market so only the best have really survived. Because this is such a  small industry, when money starts to actually come into this industry  it will move violently and quickly. To start off I would recommend any  of the big ETFs to get your feet wet such as URA or URNM. I can share my thoughts on specific companies if you are interested but most of them are quite small relative to other equities and require a fair bit of DD.

**#6 - What could go wrong?**

At  this point, the only catalyst that looks certain to kneecap the the industry overnight is a nuclear disaster and that is always a risk. From  a safety perspective, all countries have spent a significant amount of  money since Fukushima on upgrading their reactors to ensure they are as  safe as possible so this risk is somewhat mitigated but it is always a  possibility and one that you should be aware of.

Walmart Inc.’s Marc Lore, the architect of its digital operations, is leaving the retailer at a time when its battle with Amazon.com Inc. is growing even more intense.

Lore, 49, plans to retire from the role effective Jan. 31. He will stay on as a strategic adviser through September, the company said in a filing. His contract required him to stay at Walmart for five years, and he’s fulfilling that with his short-term consulting role.

Walmart shares fell as much as 1.5% as of 9:30 a.m. on Friday in New York.

The retailer didn’t name a new executive to inherit the U.S. e-commerce business that generates more than $25 billion in sales and has been responsible for a good chunk of Walmart’s growth in recent years, especially during the pandemic, as more shoppers migrate online.

I was doing ok but let’s be honest, with this market everyone is doing ok. I have a friend that just buys the motley fool’s recommendations without even checking anything else about the company and he is doing great so it’s really not that hard right now...

Anyway I was thinking about getting back into it but I feel like my all “under valued stocks with good fundamentals” strategy is naive.

I am up against hedge funds that have tones of money and employees who are payed very well to watch the market all day long.

So I think my “under valued” companies didn’t really fly under the radar, it’s just that nobody cared about them for certain reasons that I didn’t know because I didn’t look deep enough or I was missing some key informations about them.

This year, if ARK performs only half of what it did in 2020, a $100,000 investment today would become $200,000 by end of year.

1. In 2020 they avg roughly 200% growth... which would make 100k into 300k with month over month compounding growth.
2. Their performance in 2020 demonstrates they can not only survive but thrive through a downturn.
3. ARK shares openly share their trades daily and Cathie Wood has become such a household name, that people literally pour into any company she invests in... significantly appreciating the equity.
4. 2021 looks strong with nearly $2T stimulus, COVID vaccines, new pres, etc.

Can ARK 2X or 3X your investment in 2021?

I’m able to achieve 2X and more with SPACs and key equity investments, but it’s a lot of work and seems higher risk than ARK... since they actively manage a stronger diversification.

BULL CASE

1. Cathie recently said herself they expect min of 20% growth next few years... I interpret this as, worse case... not likely or best case... I feel she’s trying to downplay their potential so IF they have a bad year she can say she warned everyone that repeating > 200% gains like in 2020 is not guaranteed.
2. ARKS fund can’t go up forever... out flow will eventually damage the funds performance.
3. A market correction is coming.  Ok, but this will hurt most all portfolios and one could argue ARK can better “actively” manage their ETFs through a downturn than most retail and many professional investors.

So... SERIOUS QUESTION... what am I missing?  Why not go all in on ARK ETFs for 2021?!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HRC Steel Prices hit ALL-TIME HIGH

“Imports are now more attractive even with the longer lead times, and in some cases the lead time is not much longer than domestic,” a Midwest service center source said. 

“Service center inventories are not good at all, honestly. Everyone in the South is calling each other trying to spot buy coils - every day,” a consumer source said. “I’m feeling we may not reach the top till April, May now. Demand is so strong. [We] need more supply, and relief isn’t coming anytime soon.”

I’ve said over and over that lead times and domestic supply was non-existent. 

I also said this would open the door for imports.

Say you have a large amount of $ worth of shares of a company that shoot up to a very profitable position, but you are unsure if the surge will continue, so you buy a few puts equaling less than the total profits of your original position. This strategy could be employed instead of partially exiting your original position in fears of losing a part of your gains. Of course if the surge continues the puts could end up wiping out your gains anyways so maybe it is a dumb idea._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Penny stock website Which website does anyone usually using for being notified when any new penny stock being available to be traded online.

How soon can I sell those shares? I purchased 100 shares of the ENVIU SPAC this afternoon after I saw that they IPO'd today.

After buying the shares, I noticed that there was no way for me to click on the stock to have the option to trade them again.

I am not very familiar with how SPAC's are first set up and how investing in their IPOs works. I figured this company would be like any of the other popular SPAC's that are merging (e.g. APXT or CCIV) where you can freely buy and sell as your want.

I came across this stock a couple weeks ago and bought in at $17/share and it is now trading around $20. The company was spun off of Smith and Wesson and first began trading in 2020. As of its most recent Earnings Report, they grew revenues 60% YoY ($130 million for the 6 month period) and EPS grew from $(0.38) to $0.65 for the comparable six month periods. Margins were also improved along with the company strengthening its cash position. With a market cap of just under $280 million this valuation looks very attractive for a rapidly growing company. Because of their association with a long standing major company like Smith and Wesson as well as many deals with retail brands in the outdoor products and accessories space, I think this company could be a great buy and hold for many years to come.

&#x200B;

**$ARCT** \- Meteoric Rise to crash. But it is now testing volume support here, and it may hold. 500EMA being held, possible first pull back of large move here. RSI fair, Stoch fair

**$BILL** \- I love these. Channel resistance retests at support... love it. Might need a few days to develop but looks great. RSI fair, Stoch low, and Vortex crossing, good setup.

**$BURL** \- Same play as $BILL. Bouncing off the 50EMA, channel, and support -- but it looks like it is possibly tired. RSI and Vortex fair, but Stoch is low which is great.

**$CLNE** \- Pull back here, or closer to end near $9. I am not convinced either way but a great set up. Bouncing off 50EMA lovely, support close by. All indicators are fair

**$EGP**  \- Gorgeous channel up. Holding support at the POC and just tapped in channel. Indicators are fair, but that makes sensE being in the middle of an ascension. 

**$EVBG** \- Channel up that just hit resistance, it is gonna break through? It has 50EMA, support, and channel support. RSI fair, but Stoch low, Vortex consolidating; good setup.

**$EVTC** \- Great channel up as well. Bounces off the 50EMA. Bouncing off $37 support and now in channel again. RSI fair, but Sotch is low with divergence. May drop to 200EMA

**$IRWD** \- Channel up, bouncing off the 200EMA line. Good set up, but not true support line to hold it well. RSI fair, But Stoch low and Vortex getting there.

**$KTRA** \- BE careful. Just tapped support today and took off. Might have more in the tank; if not watchlist for later and buy in $1.30 Indicators say it has room to still room!

**$MSFT** \- Obvious Blue-chip; but excellent deal. Ascending Triangle, at support, and channel -- love it. RSI is oversold-ish, Stoch and Vortex low, reversal coming.

**$NOW**  \- Beautiful channel up testing 200EMA, channel, and support. Great setup. All indicators fair but that makes sense at this price and channel action.

**$RVP**  \- JUST dropped off a cliff, after we made money 3 days ago! Channel, 200EMA, and support here, easy setup. RSI fair, but Stoch is low, so I like it a lot.

**$SEE**  \- Beautiful channel, right above 200EMA, and support - love it. Great setup. RSI low, Stoch low, Vortex low, all lining up great.

**$UPLD** \- Just a lovely channel up, but how much farther can it go?! Riding the 50EMA like a dream. Can be some easy %. All indicators are fair which makes sense with this melt up.

For weeks, mem­bers of Red­dit’s pop­u­lar WallStreetBets fo­rum have been tout­ing GameStop, en­courag­ing oth­ers to scoop up shares of the videogame re­tailer and be­gin making bull­ish wagers. Sev­eral posts on the forum had noted that short sell­ers’ bear­ish Game­Stop bets had been at el­e­vated lev­els.


Short in­ter­est, which in­di­cates the in­ter­est of investors bet­ting a stock will fall in value, has hovered around 138% of the stock’s free float this year, Fact­Set data show. This makes it the sec­ond-most-shorted com­pany by that met­ric across the New York Stock Ex­change and the Nas­daq, ac­cord­ing to Dow Jones Mar­ket Data. That had some Red­dit users pre­dict­ing that the stock might rapidly rise if short sell­ers had to cover their bets by buy­ing back shares should the stock sud­denly in­crease in value.


This week, that fore­cast fi­nally ap­peared to take shape af­ter news of changes to Game­Stop’s board sent shares climb­ing.


On Mon­day, the com­pany said it had struck a deal to add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two for­mer ex­ec­u­tives to the GameStop board.

On Red­dit on Thurs­day, Wall­Street­Bets users were cel­e­brat­ing Game­Stop’s gains. Many posted screen-shots of big wins from bull­ish options bets. Sev­eral talked about how they would spend their prof­its. One user posted that the ex­pe­ri­ence demon­strates that the WallStreet­Bets fo­rum “runs the mar­ket.”

GME has gone wild and I know some among you are feeling that fomo so heres a way to get a bit for yourselves without getting burned and relieve a bit of that burning fomo i bet youre feeling right now. But first short a recap of whats been going on with GME. Melvin Capital and other shorts have been attempting to short GME into the ground on the thesis that brick and mortar is going out and they have insufficient web presence and no path toward growth in the future. A compelling and logical thesis. Activist investor Micheal Cohen took the other side of the bet. He recently increased his share  and got himself and two allies seats on the board. He intends to sell off underperforming locations to make money for building online sales. This action kills the short thesis in my opinion  because even if Cohens plan doesnt pan out and he cant turn gme around, shorts have to be right within a short(heheh) time period and they are all dreadfully underwater. Also Burry is bullish and has a position in GME.

Positions:1/22$55c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Havent seen a thread for CCIV/Lucid deal. Whats your take? Havent seen a thread on this sub about it. I personally have 10% in it, half warrants half commons.

I think this is too juicy to pass up in the current market. No doubt in my mind that this thing is gonna be big when the news lands.

My strategy is to sell 25% of my holdings (probably some of the commons- not quite sure yet) when the news hits or possibly post merger, and to execute the warrants when I am able. This is a hold for me, but I will take some profits. Ive missed the boat on too much shit to pass an opportunity like this up.

In my personal opinion, commons under $18 are a steal if you believe the rumor. This thing will be well past $20 after the news, and kissed $20 this morning before selling off (unsurprisingly).

Let’s just forget about ethics. It is nearly impossible to tell if a Medical specimen is ethically sourced since paper work is non existent in most cases. Anyways looking at this in the financial perspective, there is no new product despite there being so many people. Bodies donated to science like cadaver labs, body farms, etc end up being cremated and sent back to the family’s, and you cannot be donated for sale since it takes advantage of people. So the rarity of remains is going up, and the demand isn’t going anywhere. A skull would have sold for 500 a few years ago and now they are going for around 2000, and is only going up.

Long-time lurker, I believe first-time poster. I'm a management consultant that works mostly in the health care space, and I'm here to tell you that herd immunity is now an almost sure bet in most developed countries sooner than most people expect it, and this is going to lead to a few quarters of the greatest economic boom most of us have ever seen. 

Right now governments around the world are doing what we call "expectation setting", and telling the public that we will achieve herd immunity by the fall. I believe, based on what I have seen, that this is a conservative estimate. Remember when they told us a vaccine would take 12-18 months minimum to develop? It took nine months, and  that was for multiple vaccines. I think it's very likely we will see a similar situation with vaccine distribution, and by June it will pretty much be flowing freely in most developed countries.

This is going to lead to complete euphoria in all parts of our lives, including the market. Restaurants will be so full you won't be able to get a table. Good luck getting a seat on an airplane or a room on a cruise ship. All of those service workers who lost their jobs are going to be working overtime. 

The stock market is going to absolutely explode. "Priced in" some people are saying. Have you seen how the market behaves lately? You really mean to tell me that the market is going to look at record-shattering quarterly earnings and say "meh, was priced in"? I don't think so. Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 are going to be absolutely insane. I bet SPY tests 500 by this time next year.

And then we arrive at the ejection point. All of that money governments spent propping up the economy? We need to pay that back. Interest rates will rise. Significant tax increases will be announced starting in fiscal 2022, and likely this is where the ship starts to fall back to earth and it's time to bail.

I'm not hubristic enough to think I can't be wrong. I could be, but I am confident enough in this play that I'm all in and the only thing I am thinking about right now is trying to time that ejection button in 2022 as best as I can._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next megatrends/hypes Hi Guys,

New to Reddit, r/wallstreetbets got me to sign up here. It's awesome entertainment with all the memes and mad gains/losses. Especially the latest GME run, whooh. However, I am also into some seriuous discussion, maybe it can be found from here?

So as all of you know, last year went full nuts, with first corona diping 40%+ all of the stocks and then some of the specific stocks went 10x+ towards end of the year. Many of these stocks/industries weren't new and had been around for some time. Let's take a look on some of these:

EVs:  
Tesla and Nio have had amazing run since March as all of you know. EV's are not new idea and have been around quite for a while, actually first electric cars were built already in 19th [century](https://www.energy.gov/timeline/timeline-history-electric-car#:~:text=First%20Crude%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Is,an%20English%20inventor%20in%201884). Still I would say the 2020 was year of EVs.

Renewables:  
Companies producing renewable fuels and generating renewable energy. We have witnessed huge gains in renewable sectors, e.g. SunPower is 10x since March. Renewables have also been out for ages; solar panels, wind mills etc. and are not new invention, but it seems that year 2020 was a turning point at least from investing point of view. We all have this common goal to fight climate change, u know :D

So these two industries that had been around already for while got hyped and witnessed huge gains in 2020 . What do you think, what would be the "old" industry that would get the hype in 2021?

Thinking outside of box, could it be cyber security and privacy? 2010's was the age of social media and transparency of lives of individuals; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat e.g. came.  People shared all of their lives to their followers and friends, but also to these digital giants. Using the data, these giants have profiled us all to sell advertisements, but to data could be used also to guide us, as US presidental elections and Cambridge Analytics proved in 2016. Today in 2021, WhatsApp starts sharing our personal messaging data with Facebook to collect even more data of us and our personnal discussions and so profiling us even more accurately. I have also realised that more and more of my friends are deleting their social media accounts and are starting to concern about privacy. 

So what do you think? Is there chance that cyber security and privacy could be hit by the one of the near-future hypes?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Search for notices of non-compliance from the NASDAQ? Is there a way to search for tickers that have received notices of non-compliance from the NASDAQ? Basically I want to be able to search "5550(a)(2)(d)" and get a list of tickers that have a public notice.

Doing this in Google sucks, I couldn't get a straight answer out of the sales rep at [briefing.com](https://briefing.com)
