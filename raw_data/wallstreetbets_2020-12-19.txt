Since then, it's been consolidating in a wedge pattern. It started to break out on Wednesday.

Important things are that it always found support at the 20SMA (red line) and volume is increasing as it broke out (bottom bars). Another important price is the $9.19 high price within the wedge. It's key that it manages to stay above that, and the longer it does, the higher the confidence of a breakout. On Friday, the morning pump got stalled right at 9.2, but it broke out on the 2nd try. On the way down in the afternoon market dump, it still never got too far below 9.2 before bouncing, which means there is buying at that level instead of selling now. Price target is $13 - $14.

\*12/21 update - Well, today was a shit day. The whole market was down, so being stuck here is understandable. It is a little concerning that the other clean energy stocks (JKS, ICLN, TAN) are up, but PLUG is down too so maybe it's fuck Hydrogen day? Anyways, we still got support at the open and was green for a while, and we managed to stay above $9 and is currently testing the $9.19 again. I'd understand if you want to bail since we're not recovering with the rest of the market, but I actually added a bit more now and will give it until the end of the week for a movement.

* The global food industry is doing well: Revenue in the Food market is projected to reach almost a trillion dollars with annual growth of a bit under 1%
* Snacks and Confectionary are the biggest segment within the food industry
* A shift towards the consumption of "convenience foods" from freshly cooked meals is increasing (largely due to lockdowns and the consequential failure of many restaurants in the coming year). But this trend was already on-going before the crisis, increasing steadily each year throughout the world.
* The packaged food industry is booming in the Asia pacific region

Conclusion: Smart Packaging is the future.

So you may ask, why am I talking about packaging and not food FMCG or food companies such as Kraft Foods, Tyson, Pepsi etc., simple, because they are also dealing with a lot of the fallout of the crisis. This doesn't mean they will neccessarily lose out due to these trends, but the potential for loss is just as high as for gains.

You may also ask for reasons why I am talking about SMART packaging?

* Smart packaging is a trend towards improved product safety
* It is an industry driven by rapid innovation
* Packaging is vital to keep quality between processing and usage by the customer
* Active Packaging - increasing shelf life of products
* Intelligent packaging - Monitoring all aspects of the product's life-cycle, sense, detect and record the environment and report this to the customer or the company
* Smart packaging is applied in dairy, meat, seafood, bakery, confectionary and drinks, which are all growing markets heavily dependant on quality
* The technology is nascent, but available

Most importantly: smart packaging will solve many of the new problems arising through the covid crisis, making the customer trust the product's quality and remove fear of pandemic related issues (such as infection, breaking of cooling chains, supply chain disruptions etc.)

There are many companies workin in this field, but here are a few that might be interesting:

Assuming 10% drop out rate, that lowest efficacy rate to have not produced >50 cases by 12/19 is around 93 to 94% efficacy rate.

**Jan 7th**:

Alex Karp has a Palantir Covid-19 special event with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.

>At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. data analytics company Palantir Technologies was tapped by over a dozen governments around the world including the U.S. government to use its software to manage the data about the spread of COVID-19, analyze trends and anticipate various needs across the supply chain. Alexander Karp is CEO and one of several co-founders of Palantir. On Thursday, Jan. 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET, Karp will join Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to talk about the challenges faced by governments around the world in relying on technology and software to respond to the pandemic.

Register at [https://palantir.events/livedemoday](https://palantir.events/livedemoday)

&#x200B;

**Feb/March**:

Palantir expected to report 2020 full year earnings. Will top $1B in revenue. Possible surprise profit. If the Q3 earnings report is a guide, expect lots of client success stories and Covid-19 mixed in with financial results.

Did you miss Q3? Download the presentation at [https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx) (I'm not direct linking the PDF because the url is a 3rd party; it is available from that official source)

&#x200B;

**New commercial contract announcements**:

3rd party job boards suggest hiring related to new commercial clients. Growth in the commercial space is rocket fuel. As commercial clients grow, institutional investors will recognize Palantir as an enterprise software company. Coverage at [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr\_will\_moon\_soon\_i\_got\_proof/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/)

&#x200B;

**New Government contract announcements**:

Palantir is helping State and International Governments manage their Covid-19 response. This includes outbreak detection, medical supplies production, hospital capacity, PPE distribution, vaccine development and distribution, contract tracing, and more.

This often represents the first time those Governments have seen Palantir in action. Having now experienced the speed and capabilities of Palantir's software, these Governments will likely seek additional Palantir partnerships. This real-world, global demo represents exponential contract growth potential.

&#x200B;

**Even more new Government contract announcements**:

SolarWinds hack + "cyber security agenda" of incoming US Government = Palantir opportunity. Palantir has intrusion detection, monitoring, and best practices products ready to deploy. Palantir's Cyber solution can be added on top of competitor products for layered security.

&#x200B;

**Palantir 101**:

Palantir has launched a Medium which features success stories, tech examples, and the "Palantir Explained" series which breaks down what Palantir does. Follow along at [https://medium.com/palantir](https://medium.com/palantir)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

&#x200B;

**When does the share lockup end?**:

Around \~1.85B additional shares of Palantir will become available once the share lockup ends. This is expected around mid-Feb to mid-March. Specifically, on the "third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020."  


How will that impact the share price? Hard to say. Palantir will probably make the earnings report a banger ahead of the pending lockup. The market understands Palantir better by the day. Institutional buyers may be waiting to consume the additional supply.

Insiders who sold early have missed out on billions in gains.

&#x200B;

**"Possible surprise profit" follow-up**:

A Q4 profit is unexpected, but the potential for a surprise exists. From the Q3 earnings:

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.  
>  
>Our income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.

and:

>... in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution ...

The Q3 operations loss was blown up by listing expenses and sped up stock-based comp. IF Palantir is signing more contracts than forecast and stock-based comp is restrained, then we might get a headline surprise.

&#x200B;

u/Trance2000 **points out the security clearance**:

>Palantir offers a similar service \[to SolarWinds\] but their software is built for the highest level of US government clearance.

Palantir's existing "located Osama bin Laden" level of US government security clearance means they are positioned for instant deployment related to new US cyber security efforts. 

Why vett and on-board a young competitor when you can just call Palantir?

&#x200B;

u/25143 **explains the upside**:

>The growth potential for sifting through BIG DATA is nearly limitless. That's what Palantir does. Now you know. Quite amazing if you ask me. They are more than an infrastructure company like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. They provide real insight for nearly every single company in existence that has been data hording for decades. 

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A new $TSLA investa is born _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If a stock mooned today, what stock is most likely to moon tomorrow? (Also known as a lead indicator) Analysis inside (Repost.  mods please don't remove my post for no reason while you allow shit posts to stay)

Imagine you check stock prices one day and see the price of FedEx shares has increased by 10%. You probably would think there has been some positive event for delivery businesses and probably UPS would be the next to have a run. This is intuitive but may not always work. First, the two stocks may move simultaneously, so if you have missed one price action, you've missed the other as well. Second, in many cases, the other related stock(s) are not as obvious as the FedEx/UPS example.

This is the question I want to answer:

**If a given stock had a sizeable move (arbitrarily defined by me as an increase of at least 5% from open to close) today, what stock is the most likely to have a sizeable increase tomorrow?**

**Methodology** (skip if you don't know/care about statistics)

* I focused only on the 100 most popular stocks listed on Robinhood from the beginning of the year 2020 till today. I can add more stocks later but this is the starting point.
* Define daily return for each stock as r = (close - open)/open\*100
* Define excess return (er) for each stock by subtracting the S&P 500 (SPY) returns. So for example, if $AAPL went up by 10% and $SPY went up by 3%, the excess return for AAPL is 7%.
* Define a mooning event as an excess daily return of at least 5%.  If er >= 5, moon = 1. Otherwise moon = 0.
* I limit the analysis to stocks that had at least 5 mooning events.
* For each stock, I regress the moon variable on the 1-day-lagged moon variable of every other stock, one by one, and pick the one with the greatest statistical significance.

**Results**

This is how you read the results table.

* Today: the stock that mooned in a given day.
* Tomorrow: the stock that's most likely to moon the next day
* T-stat: how reliable the prediction is (the larger, the better)
* Probability: the probability of the other stock mooning (based on previous patterns)

For the stocks that don't appear in the Today column, it means they are not lead indicators for any other stock in the sample.

Please don't take these results too seriously. This exercise was mostly for fun and out of curiosity, not to guide a trading strategy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cramer Confronts Wallstreetbets.-- Plz take this meme. Is for you. I'm just a lurker _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood can be a gambling platform, but it's not and removing it or regulating it will exacerbate the divide between the wealthy and the rest of the U.S. Hi everyone,

Lately I've been reading and watching on the news about Robinhood and I just wanted to give my two cents as somebody who actually researches Gambling disorder in the United States. My goal in this post is to hopefully encourage people on WSB to become politically active in preventing the regulations or removal of certain aspects that Robinhood allows on its investing platform. First, let me define some terms from the Gambling disorder field:

* Gambling- placing something of value on a random outcome *in order to achieve a desired result or profit (this last part is added by me as I think it gives a better explanation of why an individual gambles in the first place)*;
* Gambling disorder: A psychological disorder where an individual is unable to control their gambling to the point that they are experiencing consequences from the behavior. The behavior also has to occur without the presence of Mania, other biological co-morbidity, or under the influence of a psychoactive substance.

In this post I will address a few arguments at Robinhood. The first is regarding the "gambling" nature of investment that Robinhood purportedly encourages. The second is that the average investor needs to be "protected" because they lack the information and knowledge to participate on the app.

When I first downloaded Robinhood, I was skeptical at first and proceeded to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times before I deposited $350 to invest in stock. The app provided me a "scratch-off" with my first deposit that rewarded me with my first stock (some medical company). That was the only time that event occurred. If we look at my prior definition of gambling, technically that is not a form of gambling. I placed nothing of value on this random outcome. If the actual act of investing in stock is gambling this leads to an interesting analogy regarding trading platforms, not just Robinhood.

Stocks are the game (roulette, blackjack, craps), Robinhood and trading platforms are the dealers (giving information on the rules of the game and how much it costs to place a bet), and the liberal market is the casino.

In this analogy everybody is in the Casino, and if you don't play the game you stand to lose regardless as your money loses value to inflation. Even worse, if the casino folds the people that didn't cash out or were fully invested in the casino never collapsing  (The Great Depression, the recession of 2008 the coronavirus recession) can stand to lose everything even if they didn't participate (regular person that was laid off) or were placing safe bets (ETF's Blue chip stocks etc).

The Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, William Galvin, is addressing the wrong issue by suing Robinhood. What should be addressed is the reasons that people even participate in Robinhood or in any trading platform. The average individual doesn't understand the market and the United States does not address this ignorance by providing information on how to properly invest for retirement or provide a welfare structure that protects against poverty as individuals become unable to participate fully in the economy due to injury, developmental disability, age, discrimination or lack of access to the "free" market. To claim that people on Robinhood "gamble" for excitement or risk is reductive. People invest their money on Robinhood for the potential accumulate life changing "tendies" that will protect them from the eventuality that they will be unable to participate in the economy and the government will not insulate them from the fiscal impact an individual will (not if) have to deal with in regards rising medical cost for their healthcare and any other services they would require in order to lead a normal life. If William Galvin is actually concerned about the "gamefying" of investment, he should focus on regulating Wall Street and the Banking sector, because last time I checked investors on Robinhood invest with their own money, not the money of other people.

The argument that the average investor isn't informed also leads to more issues that I guarantee the government doesn't want to address or even ask because it would require an expansion of the welfare state and higher taxes on companies and individuals. If the average American is too dumb to invest using Robinhood that what is the solution? The U.S. government has always fought any sort of government guaranteed income or services to insulate an individual against against insolvency from the free market as can be seen by the desire to privatize almost all forms of government programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps and Medicaid. This has already occurred with certain programs at the federal level such as HUD which doesn't do anything to help people get affordable housing and the drastic reduction in funding for colleges and universities especially after boomers were done getting their degrees for essentially free.

So lets examine what the average person has to understand in the American economy,

* they have to be able to plan and invest for their retirement,
* understand  loans (including all the fine print such as interest) to pay for college, and purchasing of necessary items for certain areas such as housing or a car;
* Navigate a Byzantine like medical industry that can easily bankrupt the average American even with insurance;

So the average American is suppose to navigate all of the aforementioned areas with little to no government assistance. But Robinhood should be regulated, makes sense. Let's not even talk about that most Americans read at about an 8th grade level and have a tough time understanding that a quarter pounder is less than a one third hamburger...

"Why the third pound hamburger failed: One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald‚Äôs Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&W‚Äôs burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it. Only when the company held customer focus groups did it become clear why. The Third Pounder presented the American public with a test in fractions. And we failed. Misunderstanding the value of one-third, customers believed they were being overcharged. **Why, they asked the researchers, should they pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as they did for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald‚Äôs. The ‚Äú4‚Äù in ‚Äú¬º,‚Äù larger than the ‚Äú3‚Äù in ‚Äú‚Öì,‚Äù led them astray**. --Elizabeth Green, NYT Magazine, on losing money by overestimating the American Public Intelligence."

The **REAL QUESTION** is what responsibility does the government have to insulate the average American from an economy that by its very nature is predatory, especially when the argument set forth by William Galvinson is that the public doesn't understand how to invest on Robinhood. Especially since the government has told the public from day one to take care of themselves as they get older through investing instead of expecting the government to provide assistance. By removing or regulating Robinhood, the fungibility of the average American's dollar will drop in value because they are prevented from another avenue of wealth accumulation, which research shows (at least for those in poverty) they turn to gambling as a means of wealth accumulation because even though the return on a gamble is less it is technically even since their dollar is also worth less.

I think I may have gone on a rant, sorry.

TL; DR,

Please buy me some tendies William Galvin, because I like to be wined and dined before I GET FUCKED!

Robinhood isn't gambling. Robinhood just provides a service to investing on Wall Street, the actual gambling is our devotion to supply side economics which is the original, STONKS ONLY GO UP üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Also, if we are going to start regulating Robinhood because of the actions of a minority (WSB) then we should start regulating other industries that are WAY more predatory and impact a larger amount of the U.S. such as, payday loans, guns, pharma industry, surprise medical bills from emergency rooms, childcare, prison industry, bail industry etc. I bet you the cost to the U.S. economy from those industries is way more than anything Robinhood has done.

Here is a simple timeline for your orangutans:

1. **FireEye announces a breach 12/8/2020: Stock PLUMMETTED (slightly)** because the initial impression was that JUST FireEye was breached. They announced unauthorized access to their Red team tools. For all of you adolescent, non-cyber aware, noobs... This SEEMS like a big deal but it was blown out of proportion. The first thought is "Wow, now the bad people who stole the red team tools are going to screw over my company". Not necessarily, the red team tools that were taken did not include any Zero-day exploits (Translation: Nothing new that hasn't existed). Many company's current infrastructure would already have defenses in place to circumvent the use of these red team tools. EVEN SO, and something most companies would NOT do....FireEye released a github repository of countermeasures for their own proprietary red team tools So at this point, the world things just FireEye is breached and sucks.... FireEye focuses on their internal investigation. > Around $15.51 a share on 12/8 > Dropped to around $13.49 a share.

2. **World things FireEye sucks because ONLY THEY were breached...** so they thought, until 12/13 came around. FireEye literally did not give a \*\*\*\* and continued with their investigations. FireEye is at the forefront of investigating a WORLD-WIDE impacting supply-chain breach. FireEye tracks down the source of the breach to Solarwinds (and doesn't throw any shade AT ALL while doing it). They coin the exploit/threat being called "SunBurst". With this being said, it was recently announced that C-Level at Solarwinds knew about this breach a day or two before even they themselves announced it (a few higher ups sold millions in stock). So let's take a sec to compare here before moving on  
\- FireEye: Announces they identified a breach as soon as possible to them finding out. They then, again ASAP, announce that red team tools were potentially stolen and IMMEDIATELLY publish a github repository to assist the world. They then identify the breach came from a company (Solarwinds) before the company has the balls to announce it (leaving time for selling their own stonks first of course). FireEye has a chance to blatantly say "Hey it wasn't our fault it's cause this other company got popped". But they don't, instead they take the angle of providing as much information as possible for ALL organizations to use to help determine if they themselves have been impacted.  
\- SolarWinds: Finds out they were breaches, takes time to sell stocks, then announces the breach a day later. Oh ALSO, I have been threat hunting for Sunburst IoCs (indicators of compromise) in over 90+ unique environments/companies and we are using FireEye's report to base our investigations off of, as is the majority of the world.  
At this point, stocks don't really rise too much because plebs like all of you don't realize that FireEye is now the focal point of detection, mitigation, and ongoing defense in this recovery from a Nation-state attack. CISOs at almost EVERY company that uses SolarWinds (most companies use solarwinds) are making poopies in their $3,000 kakis and are turning to FireEye reports for guidance. FireEye is also releasing detection and response capabilities to their current customer base IMMEDIATELY (I saw this in real time across several companies). This is leading companies that don't use FireEye as a service provider to say "Hey, that would be nice to have they are really good" just in time for next year's budgets to be announced, what do you think companies are going to buy??? FireEye and other Cyber security tools, duh you apes.

3. **Tensions are high**, companies are squirming to determine if they are impacted, and FireEye is there to give guidance, FOR FREE< FOR THE SAKE OF THE CYBER WORLD, every step of the way. You stinky boys start to realize and BOOM! Their shares go from $13.60 to $18.21, nearly a 30% increase. Other actually useful cyber security tool and service providers see increases as well. Crowdstrike is one to highlight. Crowdstrike pushed out a Sunburst dashboard to all their customers allowing for searches to be conducted on key IoCs dating back to March almost INSTANTLY. Stocks FLY UP and a lot of people aren't even aware that things like that are being pushed live by specific companies like Crowdstrike.

&#x200B;

**Let me summarize this for the illiterate drop outs that skip right to the bottom**, Good Cyber security companies that RESPOND at the call of action and enable their customers to stay protected and help with identifying if they are impacted, are the ones that will BOOM the entire next year. Companies are getting their budgets determined for the next fiscal year and reputable companies like some I will list below WILL be getting more customers for the LONG HAUL. The list I am providing is not based of book knowledge, it is not based off of random research from other people that used the tool like twice, it is based of my personal use of every single one of these tools, and using them in more than one environment DAILY for the last 6-years as well as responding to 3-4 major breaches just this year with these tools. If you want "TENDIES TO THE MOON" as you turkeys say, invest in these as they have nowhere to go but UP...

&#x200B;

1. **FireEye (FEYE):** Has always been and will continue to be a company that is a cumulation of industry and world leading technical knowledge. They will ALWAYS be at the forefront and after their actions and response to one of the biggest breaches we have seen in years... will 100% grow in reputation and customer base.
2. **Crowdstrike(CRWD):** First to address the "Never buy green" mentality... IDGAF how steady they are increasing right now, it will continue due to the Elite level service and tools they provide. Out of every Endpoint Detection and Response tool I have used, which is all of them, Crowdstrike is the BEST. Carbon black (VMWare), Cylance, Palo Cortex, and others can all suck a cyber fart for now. Crowdstrike is almost INSTANT when something new comes up in the industry. They notify their customers of threats ASAP and even create/deploy dashboards and capabilities for almost every response. The ppl at CRWD dont sleep, and neither should you.... get this stonk.
3. **Palo Alto (PANW):** I know when I was complementing Crowdstrike I threw shade at Palo's Cortex XDR tool... BUT Palo is the most feature driven, verbose, and intuitive cyber tool provided when focusing on mainstream firewall providers. The thing is... they always evolve, they don't just do firewalls, they are at the forefront of the new Cyber buzz word "XDR" (XDR is cross-layered detection and response. XDR collects and automatically correlates data across multiple security layers). Their services and tools are widely used, consistently improving, and always evolving. Palo is EXTREMELY sticky with customer retention. They integrate so closely with a network that moving away from their tools costs more money than it's worth. EXPECT PEOPLE TO THROW WADS OF CORPERATE CASH AT THIS NEW XDR SERVICE ALSO.

I have more but my top 3 are above. If you like this type of post and have an interest in Cyber/tech stock tips from someone who sleeps, eats, and breathes it everyday, let me know and MAYBE I will be back soon.... Let me leave you with the sleeper below

**Splunk (SPLK):** They have severely dropped in stock value for several reasons that you all probably are aware of but here is something to think about.... There are steadily crawling back up in stock value over the past week (Up \~7%). Splunk is BY FAR the BEST SIEM ( Security information and event management) that is currently available. I have access to every single SIEM and Splunk is the ONLY one that gets me excited because it is more advanced and capable than the rest. They may not be profitable now but once they get over a couple humps soon they will be profitable. Splunk is not going away and is creating "Mission Control" to pretty much instantly combat the "XDR" trend without having to spend extensive amounts of money developing a brand new tool, since it lives in Splunk already._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PLTR Wedge Breakout Soon $PLTR to $40 EOY _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 70% return in under a minute God i love tsla red days...

It was common knowledge that S&P index funds and ETFs buying TSLA were doing so with MOC or "Market on Close" orders (placing massive orders to buy TSLA at market closing price. This massive inflow of cash squeezed the stock all the way from 650 to 695 then settling around 680 after the bell.

The missed opportunity was that 5 minutes before close, 660 options were trading for a buck ($100). Knowing the price would likely go up after close,  we could have exercised the option, buying 100 shares of TSLA for 660, then selling them back to the market at 680. This could be done over and over, depending on your level of autism,  which would have influenced how many you bought.

This could have been us (I was holding onto 100 shares).

So there you have it. 20 baggers were out there  in the wild, free for the picking, if we only opened our eyes.

Edit: Market close (and open) imbalances are published  everyday by Nasdaq.  At 3:50 they released the Friday imbalance showing TSLA had a 68M buy side imbalance. Meaning there were too many buy orders and not enough matching sell orders.

The price is still very cheap if you read below but as we get closer to Q1 2021 the price will be too expensive even with taking into account the warrants and tontine. PSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and every 9 shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. Right now $PSTH is $2.27 above the strike price of $23 sitting at $25.27. Therefore, for the price of 9 shares today ($227.43) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($227.43+46)/11 = $24.85. Regardless of who Bill Ackman acquires, you‚Äôre essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money. Also, in regards to the tontine structure, it‚Äôs possible you can get 3 or 4 additional shares for every 9 you own bringing the average price down further. Most likely traders will sell pre-deal close due to a pop in price so if we assume 3 additional shares for ever 9 owned you will have an entry price of $24.70 now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After going balls to the wall on some PLTR weeklies bc a stranger on the internet said ‚ÄúüöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bayer's way back up üöÄ Good afternoon fellow degenerates

here we go;  
\*\*What is Bayer AG?\*\*  
Bayer AG is an international holding with a wide variety of chemical products subdivided in Healthcare, Crop Sciences and Pharmaceuticals. The Crop Sciences division accounts for roughly 45% of the revenue and was given a boost after the takeover of Monsanto back in 2018. The division Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of new treatments and accounts for 41% of the revenue.The division healthcare produces Bayer's classics that are no longer patent protected like aspirin and probably heroin too.

\*\*Why does Bayer trade under 50 right now?\*\*  
This is a good one; back in 2018 Bayer AG took over Monsanto aka the monster that brought Roundup upon us. Even though Roundup is still freely available in most European countries, Americans have collectively decided that Roundup is evil. This is mostly because it gave them the opportunity to sue Bayer and get tendies. After all,  american courthouses are the States' favorite casinos, in a close second to WSB.  Sue anyone over anything and get tendies. Just a few months ago it started to look like the American government was about to come to a mindblowing settlement of 12 billion dollars.

In the process of coming to a settlement Bayer stock came close to its pre-covid price of 80. Then, a bunch of States decided that 12 billion is **insufficient,** refused to settle for now and are aiming for more tendies. This caused the Bayer stock to fall back to 40 which is obviously unreasonably low despite the round-up process.  Before Bayer took over Monsanto and got dragged into the whole round-up nonsense Bayer traded between 110 and 120 per share. Even now, when Bayer trades around 40-50 the numbers are looking quite steady.

\*\*Numbers;\*\*  
Although I  am convinced half the people on this sub can barely read or count numbers without an abbacus I'll bless the more gifted ones with some numbers.

|**p/share**|6,63|5,94|6,4|6,31|6,38|6,9|

Not looking too bad right?  Considering Bayer had 18 billion US Dollars cash on hand as of September 2020 the settlement will be a setback but not a major problem. Not to mention that the whole Monsanto thing has been priced in a little too well by now. Bayer, who also suffered from a covid drop is now trading incredibily cheap and the only way from here seems to be up.

\*\*Is this only about round-up or is Bayer also doing stuff these days?\*\*  
They sure are but I am not going to type out every damn news article about Bayer.Most recently they got authorized to develop medication against tumorsin collaboration with Atara Biotherapeutics.  Although  Bayer's revenue is expected to decrease this quarter, 2021 is looking a lot brighter and this stock is on its way back to 70 if not higher. Considering the surge December 16, I'd wait for a minor short squeeze and then take positions.

TL;DR; Bayer is unreasonably low priced and will fly over the course of 2021. Get shares, get options and let's visit the moon boys.

 I am considering gettings some common shares too_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I honestly think it will happen. Am I retarded, or super retarded? (PLTR) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ /NQ 30 and 5 Day Volume Profiles _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When you‚Äôre down six figures on PLTR calls and see some autist post ‚ÄúPLTR TO THE MOON üöÄ‚Äù _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rate my portfolio! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story) One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it,  as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory in the next 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years,  but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is no under estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10 million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, whatever. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion. This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from a revenue perspective, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

**Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be)**

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10 million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share), keep inflation adjusted car prices same (which I think will go down substantially even with inflation), and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up).  I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=1690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14679af1deedc9e3e04fdd564ccc006a862acc8a

&#x200B;

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of "it's tech"? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts?

EDIT: One final edit I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies like Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away.  Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to get continuously updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult for others to get to that point or use similar technology.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this?

If it is not expensive, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All in boys _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB at least there's some green in AH üôÉ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD Sold Over 35,000 Ryzen 5000 & Ryzen 3000 CPUs While Intel Only Sold 5000 10th/9th Gen CPUs In November at MindFactory _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla buying Ford will be a disaster Recently some analysts have said TSLA should use its high stock price to buy F and get the scale to match the valuation. This looks like a desperate cry from old school analysts who are just not being able to figure out the P/E of TSLA and want to merge it with a low P/E company to get an average P/E in line with their models.

This would be an absolute disaster for TSLA for 2 reasons - Unions and Dealers

First lets talk about Unions and off book liabilities None of the existing car manufacturers are actually  profitable or cash flow positive. They fake their books to show cash flow and profit by moving Union liabilities off book. All Union shops have huge retirement and healthcare liabilities. This is like saying the US govt has no deficit as Social Security and Medicare liabilities are in the future and in the present SS and Medicare are cash flow positive.

TSLA is the only profitable car maker in the world. Is it such a surprise that their valuation is in a different category from the rest?

Second dealers.

Dealers make their money on service not sales. EVs dont need much service as they have far fewer parts and most parts are electronic not mechanical. So selling EVs is bad business for dealers as a result they sabotage EV sales. Even if an ICE car company creates a great EV it just wont sell as the dealers will sabotage it. Legacy car companies are stuck with their dealerships due to legal contracts and cannot sell EVs directly to consumers. TSLA can

If TSLA were to takeover a legacy manufacturer it would infect TSLA with both of these liabilities.

Yesterday went to the dealer and bought a 2018 Kia Sedona EX with trading profits from this year. It's a Christmas surprise present for my wife. I'm not telling anyone, but it's hard to keep the secret because I'm so excited, so I figured I'd tell you degenerates.

This was my first profitable year since I started trading/investing in 2017. I was down 35k at one point, but managed to make it back and then some. DM me if you want to ask more about it.

New financial info on investor relations page! So, for those not in yet, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late. LKNCY had a little fraud problem this year crushing the stock from its high of around $49 to its low of $0.95.. soo that sounds like they got punished for it.. the company cut the head off its leadership and hired auditors to revaluate the company and settle with regulators. They settled in China a while back with a slap on the wrist and this week they settled with the SEC for $180M which honestly isn‚Äôt that bad..

The auditors released a presentation on their investor relations page: 
https://investor.luckincoffee.com/static-files/177f69c0-b876-407e-ae2f-40f032af1ebd

Which is where I am getting my numbers from ‚òùÔ∏è

Anyway the moral of the story is that even after the run this week their market cap is only ~$2.38B (TDAmeritrade overview page) implying that based on the presentations revised 2020 FY revenue LKNCY is trading at 3.57x revenue!! Idk about you but that is a screaming buy!! 


Im just tryin like everyone else on here so check my math and tell me if I‚Äôm autistic or retarded! 

4.2B RMD is 2020 revenue 

That‚Äôs 4,200,000,000 RMD x 0.15 (conversion to USD) = 642,496,554

$2.38B is market cap as of yesterday 

So, $2,380,000,000 / 642,496,554 = 3.57x 2020 FY Revenue

TLDR: this is a unique opportunity to get a growing company at a ridiculously low valuation. $3.57 x FY2020 Revenue and with $742M cash/equivalents a $2.38B market cap is just too low. That‚Äôs basically a 3x value of cash._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QS üöÄüîã _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Another QQQJ June 35c Play _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TLRY YOLO (Repost Gay Mods keep taking down my posts)

 

**Intro**

Heading into the Georgia Runoff Election on Jan 5. Incumbents David Perdue & Kelly Leoffler are battling Jon Ossnof & Raphael Warnock. This election is very important as you know, many things are at stake. If democrats can take both seats in Georgia , we'd have a tied senate. And then Kamala would be called in to break the tie. If this happens volatile marijuana stocks like TLRY and ACB would go parabolic.

**Key Point** More Democrats are turning out for this runoff than ever before. Thanks to Stacey Abrams & Barack Obama. So basically all the DEMS need to win is to show up. Because there's hundreds of thousands of urban folk in Atlanta that aren't concerned with voting. If they show up in mass it's a wrap. The only reason REPS always win is they turnout more.

[https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-in-georgia-us-senate-runoff-approaches-presidential-levels/LAZJKUGNYBHRFIHVCNWXOLKAQM/](https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-in-georgia-us-senate-runoff-approaches-presidential-levels/LAZJKUGNYBHRFIHVCNWXOLKAQM/)

Scenario 1:DEMS take both seats, wallstreet goes crazy. TLRY,ACB, and many other weed stocks begin a 2021 bullrun. Remember what happened to weed stocks during the presidential election when Biden came out on top. This is the same situation.

Scenario 2: REPS take both seats, marijuana would mainly trade flat. Wallstreet is already expecting this.

Scenario 3. One seat goes to each party, marijuana trades flat or pullsback slightly.

(Take advantage of this great opportunity to make money, there's basically no risk even if DEMS don't take both seats. You'll be down slightly on your options. This is a short term play. Not an investment, before you marijuana scientists jump on my post with "GUH BUH MY WIFE‚ÄôS BOYFRIEND TOLD ME ACB IS A TRASH COMPANY!".

This is no normal hack, this is not a retail store, THIS IS A COMPANY TRUSTED WITH THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM OF THE IT SYSTEMS OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE US GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMY.

We don't know how big the flames of this dumpster fire will continue to grow to, but the brand has been tarnished, customers are being ordered to disconnect (NOT PATCH) affected systems, the CEO dumped over 20% of his holdings before the announcement on his way our the door........IT LOOK LIKE TIME FOR PUTS

**What is SolarWinds?**

SolarWinds provides network monitoring and management tools at a "God View", utilized by over 300,000 clients.

"In a nutshell, SolarWinds' Orion product provides centralized monitoring across an organization's entire IT stack. That means the attackers who were able to compromise this platform had an extremely high level of access to all of these client systems," David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec

&#x200B;

**Who is affected?**

Over 425 of the Fortune 500.

US government entities such as DHS and DOJ.

All branches of the US military.

&#x200B;

"SolarWinds currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000." SolarWinds, Per report to SEC

**How bad could the impact to customers be?**

According to a report by Politico following a National Security Council, an official was quoted as saying "This is probably going to be one of the most consequential cyberattacks in U.S. history."

[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/14/massively-disruptive-cyber-crisis-engulfs-multiple-agencies-445376](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/14/massively-disruptive-cyber-crisis-engulfs-multiple-agencies-445376)

Government entities are NOT being ordered to update/downgrade to unaffected versions, they are being told, "Disconnecting affected devices, as described below in Required Action 2, is the only known mitigation measure currently available."

&#x200B;

**Was there widespread Negligence?**

According to numerous reports SolarWinds has been breached before, with access to their systems being sold on underground markets. Beyond this, these rocket surgeons even used passwords for FTP servers like "solarwinds123"

[https://www.newsweek.com/notorious-hacker-fxmsp-sold-access-solarwinds-machines-report-1555061](https://www.newsweek.com/notorious-hacker-fxmsp-sold-access-solarwinds-machines-report-1555061)

After the external disclosure on the vulnerable SolarWinds version it remained available for download. Failure to remove vulnerable versions from public access was identified by a member of GreyNoise Intelligence.

**CEO and others dumped?**

The now former CEO dumped over 20% of his holdings between 11AUG2020 and 19NOV2020.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/thompson-kevin-b-415607](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/thompson-kevin-b-415607)

The now former CEO was not the only one to dump his holdings.

On December 7, Silver Lake sold $158 million in shares, while Thoma Bravo sold $128 million in shares on the same day.

Three executives from each firm sit on the board of SolarWinds and they have been the largest investors in the company since it went public in 2018.

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9060931/Two-SolarWinds-investors-sold-280million-stock-days-Russian-cyber-attack-revealed.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9060931/Two-SolarWinds-investors-sold-280million-stock-days-Russian-cyber-attack-revealed.html)

If these trades were executed to prevent losses due to a planned disclosure of the months old exploit, then this would represent massive wrongdoing. This would not be the first time they were accused of such.

&#x200B;

**Incoming lawsuits?**

In 2016 SolarWinds found themselves facing a lawsuit accusing them of "violating federal securities laws by misleading investors about its financial condition."

It further accused "SolarWinds and its executives of making false and misleading statements and failing to disclose ‚Äúmaterial adverse facts‚Äù about the company‚Äôs operations. Specifically named in the lawsuit are SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson and chief financial officer Jason Ream."

Not only did they buy back these credit spreads during the sell off, but they charge $45 extra for that.

In 2019, there were 258 million cars in China, up from 76 million in 2009 (+239%). The US has 273m in 2018, up from 255m in 2008 (+7%).  The US's numbers are a little lower than I'd expect moving forward due to the 2008 crash, I'd expect more likely an 11% increase in the next decade.  At these paces, China will have 875 million cars by 2029, and the US will have 303m cars.

Of the 258 million cars in china, approximately 1.1 million of them are imported, or 0.4%. I can't imagine China starting to import more US brands in the next decade, so those 875 million cars are going to be mostly Chinese companies. It's just such a massive market, that even if their cars aren't as good as Teslas, or their market share is a fraction of , they are going to dominate their own country's sales, which is going to quickly outpace our US market.

So, tl/dr: Chinese EV companies are going to keep blowing up over the next decade._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FDA approves second Covid vaccine for emergency use as it clears Moderna's for U.S. distribution _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB calls ranging $9-$15 expiring Jan 15 - March 19.

When you read these retarded comments about tHe NeXt BlOcBuStEr take a moment to think about who‚Äôs on the other side of the screen typing it. I guaran-fucking-tee you that all the OG bears and doubters (nothing wrong with that) have left these GME discussions for the most part. They‚Äôve read the DD, but it was too risky for their taste. I can respect that.

You know who is left? Those whose actual job is to keep the price down because otherwise they‚Äôre fucked.

https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4 - watch the whole video (shoutout to our guy u/ddroukas for it) about Cramer telling how he as a short used to keep the price down

Petition to ban these fuckers (like u/Durado) spreading fake bullshit (‚Äúmaking a new truth‚Äù, quoting our boy Cramer here) to keep their positions afloat. The clock‚Äôs ticking, they‚Äôre underwater, and they‚Äôll use anything there is to suppress the price.

I know this may spawn an echo chamber, but at this point our DD is rock solid and the only reason GME is not above 20 shooting off to the moon is that shorties are desperate and doing everything they can, including trying to spread misinformation on a largest trading forum there is

What warms my heart is that these morons are getting consistently downvoted. Keep strong my brethren and see you in Valhalla

The stock crashes frequently, but make no mistake, every time it rises again like a phoenix, stronger and higher.

They may have the money and influence, but we have the truth and diamond hands on our side. Hold the fucking line. **There is no cost in holding shares long, but shorts are getting killed by borrow fees and clenched anus on a thought of infinite losses.**

**P.S.** I kindly ask all the paper-handed spineless mofos to leave now to not play for shorties on every fucking dip

**Edit:** oh wow, u/Durado deleted their account. For those who missed it: he was going on and on and on about how GME is a trash company and how he loaded up on puts. I might be getting paranoid but it seems like that there are a lot of these kinds of folks who keep commenting the same shit. Not engaging in a discussion, not genuinely tring to understand, not reading DD's and saying what they think.

Tanium is huge not big as Stripe but Tanium has much more upside than Stripe.  One of the biggest investor in Tanium is Salesforce.
