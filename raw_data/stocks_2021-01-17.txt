 Reason for the GME price surge this last week even though the short interest hasn’t decrease at all? This last week the price almost doubled. Yet, the short interest has ostensibly not even decreased (implying this isn’t a short squeeze yet). If this wasn’t a short squeeze, then what was it exactly? 

GME short Interest had the following amounts the last few days. The short interest has been relatively stagnant. 

1/11  - 142.59% SI of float
1/12 - 138.16% SI of float
1/13 - 137.73% SI of float
1/14 - 137.51% SI of float

So the short interest isn’t even decreasing. So what’s causing this upsurge in price if it’s not a short squeeze?

Also, let’s say it isn’t a short squeeze. if there hasn’t been a short squeeze when the price has gone up 800% the past year. Then what’s to make anyone think it will ever happen? someone still shorting it at 42 is just as foolish as someone shorting it at 100 in my eyes. I don’t think we’ll ever see a large outflux of shorters.

Hi guys. I would like to ask a few questions about managing risks and hedging in swing trading. I've been fairly successful in swing trading and practice what I would consider fairly strict risk management. That is, I never risk more than 2 percent on any trade and I typically only expose 6 percent of my account at once. eg if i risk 2% on each trade, I will open up a maximum of 3 trades at the same time. I will layer on more trades once/if the initial trades are in profit and a stop loss is set at breakeven. The reasoning behind this is that if I open up too many trades today, a market correction tomorrow could wipe out my account or cause an unreasonably large drawdown that might take forever to recover from. Lately I've been thinking of ways that I can open more trades while still protecting myself from an unreasonably large drawdown, and I'd like to ask for advice. Do any swing traders here have experience in hedging?? I know how to hedge, but if my understanding is correct, hedging typically lowers your overall profitability, which is not necessarily something I want to do. I was thinking an alternative might be to actively seek out quality bearish trades despite the fact that we are obviously in a bull market. I would look for stocks perhaps at resistance or at the top of their range/rallies that appear exhausted. That way, if there is a correction or worse, my bullish trades would tank, but might be balanced out by the open bearish trades becoming abnormally successful all at once. An additional benefit would be that in the absence of a crash, the bearish trades may be successful in their own right as I would be actively seeking out quality bearish plays, rather than simply opening up a bearish trade for the sake of opening a bearish trade (which seems like the type of hedging that limits profitability). Can anyone offer advice/critiques. I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have had success with bearish plays even during a bull run.

# Process

Top post is about algos right now, and I saw a lot of comments around here talking about trading based on wallstreetbets so I thought I'd share. I've actually been running this strategy live for the last year and got great results. I also posted this strategy on Quantopian and Quantconnect a couple months ago but thought y'all might like it.

This algorithm searches wallstreetbets looking for posts related to the stocks SPCE, LULU, CCL, and SDC (these stocks are popular there). Then it conducts a sentiment analysis of the comments in the identified post and stores the values in a data frame. 

Stocks are ranked by those most popular to least popular, and then automatically bought in proportion to their relative popularity (or sold in proportion to their relative un-popularity) using Alpaca's trading API.

Retail investor participation in the market is at an [all-time high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-investor-exposure-to-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-td-ameritrade-2018-01-08), and there are plenty of simple stock analysis tools to help small investors make informed decisions. If the general sentiment from retail investors is up, then they could be purchasing the underlying equity.

Here are the links to the [csv file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qydhy62v08tw4em/Reddit_Sentiment_Equity.csv?dl=0) generated from the [Reddit sentiment analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0) program.

# Results

After just a few months: 45.3% return over the period (vs S&P 5%), 9% max drop (vs S&P 30% max drop). I recognize this is too short a time to know if this is a good long-term strategy. Turns out the wild hive mind of r/wallstreetbets has blessed foresight, is great at pumping stocks, or I'm just a lucky bastard. The S&P (a good benchmark) over this period only returned \~13% (and is up more now, as is this strategy). The risk/reward (measured in the Sharpe ratio) of the S&P is 1, this strategy is 2.2, meaning is outperforms the total market pound-for-pound.

GME is set to default in the next 8 months without further cash infusion.

# Business Model

GME high margins has always been reselling popular titles. They buy low and sell high for popular titles. This has worked in the past but the tipping point had arrived in 2019 \[1\] putting severe pressure in the old business model.

In the next generation console, online purchases will continue to be dominant. Moreover, when popular titles become less popular, they are heavily discounted online, incentivizing consumers to find deals online rather than holding on to physical media.

This compression in its high margin and sharp drop in foot traffic to drive sales will continue to impair cash flow in the future, leading to a solvency problem.

Lastly, the previous console generation had been saturated. It’ll be unsustainable for GME to depend on customer selling and buying previous console titles.

# Competitor Advantage

There has been excitement about Ryan Cohen trying to transform GME to an online business. But the competitor moats are too big to overcome. Microsoft and Sony own game studios and will continue to offer better deals on their online platform. There is no way for GME to compete with these monopolistic moats.

It is important to note that Blockbuster tried to shift online once it realize that Netflix had disrupted its business model. Blockbuster was unsuccessful because of Netflix’s first move advantage, ability to raise large debt, and operate at massive losses at scale to undercut Blockbuster move online.

A similar environment is facing GME as it plans its online pivot. Microsoft and Sony have massive cash reserves and at scale, and lower marginal operating costs compared to GME online business. Moreover, they control studios and can offer their exclusives first buying opportunities on their platforms before sales move to secondary platforms.

# Value Trap

GME has no virtuous cycle. Unlike Blue Apron that was able to improve cash flow because of the pandemic and people buying meal kits, or TSLA improving production and selling more green credits to improve production, GME has no virtuous cycle.

Market analysis indicates there is a structural shift to online buying and online platform to provide heavily discounted prices of popular titles once their popularity wanes.

I will argue that GME business model is similar to Blockbuster after it was disrupted by Netflix. GME is in a death spiral, unable to compete against Microsoft or Sony.

# Cash Flow Problems

GME operating loss in October 2020 was 184M. They had 450M in cash \[2\] at the end of October. This implies a runway of 2-3 quarters in which they need to raise cash or face default.

# Short Squeeze Mania Explained

Much excitement has been made about a possible short squeeze against Melvin Capital. People point to the recent 100% rise in GME to argue for a short squeeze. Much discussion has been made of it so I won’t add to it, except to offer another explanation, focusing on MM and delta hedging.

As rumours about an infinite short squeeze on GME rose, a sharp rise in call option buying occurred. MM as part of their delta hedges would need to buy up shares. However encountering few shares to buy MM started buying ITM calls, and moving to OTM calls. This led to higher prices and MM needing to further buy shares and call options to delta hedge. So the steep rise in price wasn’t from Melvin Capital but MM delta hedging. Furthermore, realizing the risky positions MM had taken as part of delta hedging (imperfect hedges) they decided to eliminate GME margins to slow down the gamma convexity

Therefore it is the MM that had been buying shares and not Melvin Capital. This is supported by the early evidence that Shorts took on more shorts/puts as the price went up.

# Conclusion

GME is at risk of default in 6-8 months and a short squeeze may not come. ***In fact what may be happening is that retails have entered a massive value trap that will cause them to lose most of their investment should GME continue to face a cash crunch on weak sales/massive operating cash flow losses over the next 8 months without a huge cash injection***. Even then their business model is structurally problematic.  **The risk of default is very high but retails are ignoring this in hope of a short squeeze.**

Dan_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biden proposal calls investments in federal IT ‘an urgent national security issue’ As part of his COVID relief proposal to Congress, Biden called the need to upgrade the federal IT infrastructure an urgent national security issue. To that end, the proposal requests $9 billion for the Technology Modernization Fund—a **3,600% increase over the $25 million it received in fiscal 2020.**

//

“By asking for $9 billion in TMF funding, the Biden team clearly understands its unique value proposition and ability to drive critical IT modernization efforts that can support agency efforts to respond to COVID-19 and accelerate the delivery of enhanced digital services that citizens are demanding,” said Matt Cornelius, the executive director of the Alliance for Digital Innovation, an industry association, and a former senior technology and cybersecurity advisor at the Office of Management and Budget. “OMB and GSA could use this infusion of capital to ‘flip the model’ of the TMF and use it to fund large-scale, enterprisewide IT modernization efforts across some or all federal agencies, while still making targeted investments in individual agency programs that could benefit from the TMF Board’s oversight and the flexibility of funding that TMF provides.”

We've seen the entire market crash and then recover to new all-time highs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen entire sectors of the market *(healthcare/vaccination, electric vehicle, energy, marijuana, etc.)* go completely parabolic, and we've seen some serious pump and dumps of 200%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more in a single day.

All of this volatility in 2020 gave us some incredible money-making opportunities and, whether you were able to capitalize on them or not, it also reinforced some very valuable stock market lessons that can be used going into the new year. The rest of this post will dedicated to those stock market lessons. *Keep in mind that, even though history often repeats itself, these lessons may not be as accurate under different market conditions.*

**1. Buy. The. F\*cking. Dip.**

Realistically I could probably end it here because if 2020 taught me anything it's to buy the dip! This year it happened to be a little bit more than just a dip, with the S&P 500 *(and its ETF equivalent $SPY)* dropping about 35% from its high due to worldwide economic shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic. It only took about 5 months for the S&P 500 to completely recover up to its previous high, which it ended up soaring past. Anyone that bought the dip would have been rewarded nicely, which historically has always been the case when dip buying the S&P.

Additionally, countless individual stocks also plummeted during this period, even though many of them hadn't been directly affected by the pandemic. These stocks also made great dip buys and, as you can see from their charts below, offered some incredible investment opportunities from their lows in March:

**2. Don't underestimated pump and dumps!**

Pump and dumps are a huge part of the stock market and, specifically, the penny stock market. They happen when groups of traders, such as large chatrooms or alert services, simultaneously begin to promote and buy the same stocks. Eventually, the pumpers cash out with nice profits while other traders that chased at the highs are left with a loss when the stocks gets dumped back down to reality.  Although trading them sounds a bit sketchy, there are many ways to make a lot of money with pump and dumps. If you can spot them early enough, you can ride their momentum and sell for a nice profit before the dump. Alternatively, you can wait for the pumping to end and the dumping to begin to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down. However, with this type of trading strategy you have to be extra cautious that you're short-selling the reversal, not just a temporary dip.

2020 has shown the importance of not underestimating pump and dumps and avoiding being an early short-seller. Otherwise, you can easily end up wiping out your trading account if you get caught in a short position in a stock being pumped 500% or even 1,000% or more like we saw this year with $WEI, for example.

**3. Invest in sympathy plays**

The market has had no shortage of sympathy plays over the past year, and hopefully the same will be true in 2021! Sympathy plays are simply stocks that spike for no reason other than their relation to another stock that is already spiking. Usually sympathy plays fall into the same sector as the leading stock/company and will have similarly priced stocks. A great example of this is the electric vehicle section of the market. Of course, the most well-known company in this category is Tesla *($TSLA)*, but because of the overall popularity of electric vehicles in 2020 there's been countless other companies that have jumped into the electric vehicle market just to take advantage of the momentum!

These sympathy plays may not be as reputable or as investment worthy as the sector leader, but when there's a sector with a ton of hype around it, you can make a killing by hopping into some of the lesser-known companies early on.

A quick and easy *(and free)* way to get an overview of which sectors have been performing the best lately is to go to finviz.com and select "Groups" at the top. This will show how different sectors of the market have been performing over multiple timeframes such as the past 1 day, the past 1 week, the past 1 month, etc.

**4. Don't fight the trend**

If you've been trading or studying the market for awhile, odds are that you've heard this rule. This is just a friendly reminder to trade the trend... **not** fight it! The reason this was such an important lesson from 2020 is because of the overall market. After the initial "crash" in March, seemingly everyone was expecting a 2nd crash to come shortly after everything in the market started to recover. This led to a lot of traders and investors taking losses when they tried to short-sell into the bounce, with the expectation that their short positions would profit from the market making new lows. In other words, they fought the trend.

With the market trending strongly in either direction lately, it's more important than ever to avoid fighting the trend. This means that you're better off buying into upward momentum than you are trying to buy at the exact bottom when there's a downtrend. The same is true for short-selling... you're better off short-selling into weakness than you are trying to short-sell at the exact high of a stock the is uptrending.

I think VW AG stock is so undervalued compared to the hyped EV stocks (Tesla, NIO, BYD, ...) and here's why:

\- First, I already know that the stock market values the future, and second, I'm not German!

\-For people who dont know : VW AG develops vehicles and components for the group’s brands, which include Audi, Porsche, Seat, Škoda, Scania, and MAN besides its core Volkswagen brand.

\-VW's problem was that they were late, but not too late, on EVs.

\- The Volkswagen Group capped off 2020 with 231,600 deliveries of EVs, or more than triple the 73,600 it delivered in 2019.

\- In Norway, more than 50% of registered cars in 2020 were EVs. Guess which model is #1: The Audi e-tron .

\- Porsche sells more than 20,000 Taycan electric cars in its first year of production (a taycan price is from 103.800$ to 185.000$ ).

\-VW founded a new company, Car.Software.org , with 10000 IT specialists (in Germany, Seattle, China and India ) to develop their own operating system VW.OS and VW cloud.

\-VW invests 17B euros in the software company and 10B euros for electromobility.

\- Electrify America operates an electric vehicle DC fast charging network in the United States, with more than 500 charging locations and over 2,200 individual charging units as of November 2020.

\-Electrify America is the first company to offer *Plug&Charge* service to multiple automakers.

\- Electrify America belongs to VW (subsidiary of Volkswagen Group of America).

Here are this week's results. After the overwhelming enthusiasm you’ve expressed last week on [my post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kumtz1/i_built_a_program_that_spots_buzzing_stocks_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I thought I’d share with you the new weekly picks from my program that scrapes Reddit and Twitter for emerging stocks.

As always, please do not consider any of those picks as buy signals nor recommendations. I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks.
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light DD I run before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out.

**Enough said, here’s the list!**

**TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp. (TPGY) +834%**

Market Cap: 1b

EVBox, the undisputed leader of EV charging in Europe is going public through a merger with blank-check company TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp.

Reasoning: The company has installed over 190,000 charging ports all across Europe, from Spain (3,000 ports delivered) to Germany (40,000 ports delivered) to the UK (7,000 ports delivered) to the Nordics (10,000 ports delivered). EVBox already counts multiple big companies as customers – such as Avis, McDonald’s, IKEA, and Amazon. Kristof Vereenooghe, President and CEO, will present on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, at the 23rd Annual ICR Conference. EVBox is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by late Q1 2021.

**Precision BioSciences, Inc. (DTIL) +546%**

Market Cap: 635,5m

Precision BioSciences, Inc., a genome editing company, develops therapeutic products in the United States. It offers ARCUS, a genome-editing platform to cure cancers and genetic disorders.

Reasoning: Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, ARCUS, which allows for gene editing free of patents and licenses. Compared to CRISPR, ARCUS uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. They recently signed strategic partnerships with high profile companies, such as Eli Lilly in Nov. 2020.

* Cash on Hand: $2.945B

**Growth & Opportunities**

Okta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  "We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future."

Just recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.

Okta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.

As president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.

**Price Target**

March 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.

[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \~4%) with tops being at $313.

**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARKF vs MELI? I recently was going over my positions and realized I actually held a lot of the top holdings currently in ARKF as individual positions. I have around 6-8% of my portfolio each in PINS, SE, SQ and around 5% in ARKF. I’m realizing this is a lot of overlap so I’m a bit confused on what to do. 

I really like MELI as a future growth stock, as well as some international exposure. However I do already hold SE and AMZN (and somewhat PINS) in e-commerce so I’m a bit concerned on having too many positions in the same industry. 

Other options would be to keep ARKF as it is, or distribute it among my other ARK holdings (Q and G), or open a new position like MELI or TSM. 

What would you guys recommend?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Plus500 Been playing with Plus500 demo mode. When I buy/sell, the price i have to reach is well below/above the price i need to make any money. Just wondering what this is called and wondering if anyone knows the set limit for Pluss500?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARK ETFs - A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy? I'm sure that you all are aware of this phenomenon, it seems that whenever ARK fund manager Cathie Wood invests in something, the individual ticker will always take off upon the release of daily trade notification reports.

One recent example would be PLTR - when PLTR was down about 2.27% on 14 Jan. After the trade notification report of ARKW's 497k shares purchase in PLTR was released after trading hours, reddit/stocktwit community immediately started to share about the news and it further amplified the news to a huge extent, where it popped 11% the next day after opening before inching back down.

Or another one would be the recent announcement to start a ARK Space ETF - and space related stocks were soaring on the very next day.

This phenomenon almost seems like the Midas Touch, where she has the ability to touch (or invest) anything into gold due to her almighty influence. Honestly, the best play I would reckon would be just to invest in her ETFs given the self-fulfilling nature and you never know when she will dump the stock (since a sell-off will inevitably follow thereafter).

Any thoughts about this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thinking in bets: on expected value of outcomes and evaluating decisions. The original idea here is inspired from a book called ‘Thinking in bets’ by Annie Duke. 

1. Every decision is a bet

I want you to try and think of a future prediction you're certain of. I’ve put down two examples to get your mind rolling.

    a. Are you certain your gym membership will be valuable?
    b. Are you certain the stock market will continue to go up or down?

Let me know once you've made up your mind. Because the next question will make you vet your belief, “Do you want to bet on your prediction?”

When you're asked to put a wager on your beliefs, you naturally pause to think: "What information am I missing? What does this person know that I don't?"

When you start thinking of decisions as bets, you begin to see a range of possible futures, outcomes are no longer binary. You becomes less biased, and more open to new information.

2. Expected Value

If there is one principle any long term successful poker player abides by, it's positive expected value.

Expected value = Possible reward * Likelihood of reward

For example, if a poker player determines she has a 50% chance of winning a $100 pot, the expected value is $50. If she only has to commit (or call) $25 to the pot to see her opponents hand, she has a positive expected value ($50>$25). Therefore, she should call the $25. If she loses, she still made the right decision, because over a large enough sample, she will make money.

This brings us to an even more important concept that is applicable to most areas of life.

3. Decision evaluation

The key principle to understand here is below.

Quality of outcome =/= Quality of decision

In poker, I can completely misread my opponents hand, make a terrible bet but get lucky and still win the hand.

Similarly in life, I can make a terrible decision and get a good result. I could buy a stock based on a hunch without doing market research, get lucky and make money. But if I use the same methodology over a statistically significant time frame, I will undoubtedly lose money.

“What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process.” - Annie Duke_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is "Hype" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

3. When they merge they have locations in Europe, Canada and the US.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are 5-10% annual returns sign of failure now - sign of the roaring twenties? Boomers and many investment books cite 5-10 % annual returns as good. In the recent months many stocks have gone up 3 - 5 X and the Nasdaq is up about 30% compared to Jan 2020.  As an investor (M26) who entered the stock market in Aug 2020, I have turned 2000 dollars to 4000 dollars and I am a rookie!

So I decided to invest in African ETFs but I can't find a place to do so.
Where can I do that? And how?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The rotation portfolio We can all see that the market is a bit extended and frothy. The safest thing you can do during a downturn is shift into undervalued stocks (not necessarily traditional "value stocks"). When everything is trading at an extreme premium, it's a good idea to move into stocks that are trading at a discount. I dont see most cruises/oil/airlines as value because there's a difference between plain cheap and undervalued. Undervalued stocks are good businesses whose price for whatever reason has not kept up with a companies outlook. Below are some of my personal favorites at the moment.

#Cyclical

MED- how can a company whose price has increased 626% in the last 5 years be undervalued? By being a top 5 fastest growing company (source: Forbes). Forward p/e and ev/EBITDA are both under 20 and peg is near 1. The profit margin and growth rate are mouth watering. With a market cap of just 2.4b they have miles and miles to run. They shouldn't be this cheap.

LKQ- A peg ratio of just 0.48 and managing to grow earnings in a pandemic earns them a spot on this list. The last 2 earnings have beat estimates by 231% and 41% respectively. They're expected to grow by 33.5% per annum the next 5 years, astounding considering their low multiplies. By every metric they're extremely underpriced and not for any negative reasons.

Honorable mention: LGIH

#Defensive

ACI- They're growing faster than Kroger and trading at lower multiples. Peg ratio of 0.3 is almost unheard of. Their debt remains fairly high from the Safeway purchase several years ago but it's really paid off in growth. As they continue knocking down long term liabilities we'll see them climb closer to $30.

Honorable mention: DG

#Industrial

BLD- One of the 16 companies that come up when screening a strict combination of growth and value measurements. Home improvement will continue to be popular as people move out of cities and work from home remains part of the modern work life. Excellent margins and expected EPS growth.

Honorable mentions: CSL

#Tech

CACI- This more mature version of PLTR has a great price/free cash flow ratio, low forward p/e and ev/EBITDA, good profit margins, and substantial growth. They've taken a loss of 8% over the last year in share price while nearly maintaining their growth rate through the pandemic. Solid margin of safety here and possiblity for a huge jump in price at some point.

SNX- They recently spun off their sibling company CNXC and it was expected that SNX would see slowed growth while CNXC grew rapidly. The first earnings report since the split showed the exact opposite to be the case. A bit weird seeing a tech company trade at an 8 pe, especially considering how business has picked up recently. A steady performer that won't fall far in a crash.

SSNC- earnings in 2018? 103m. Earnings in 2019? 438m. Earnings in 2020 through 3 quarters? 430m. They continue to grow earnings yet the share price has risen a meager 6% the last year. Peg ratio under 1, profit margin at 12%, and an excellent price/free cash flow make this a great discounted buy.

Honorable mention: JBL

#Communication

FB- The 1st really big name on the list. Nothing seems to stand in the way of their growth but we've only seen modest returns for it. Theres always the risk of them being forced to break up but the sum of the parts are worth more than the whole in this case. With the overall market froth you'd expect these guys to be at $300 by now.

#Healthcare

HZNP- They blasted off into profitability last year and havent looked back. Their multiples are much too low for a company experiencing this much success. Hedge fund interest plotted on a chart over the last year is is a vertical line straight up. Intrinsic value from dcf puts this at just over $100 while it trades at $78. One of the most undervalued stocks imo.

HUM- Theres no reason this should be below $450 but here we are. Their return in capital is at 24% where the industry average is 10%. An encouraging sign for future growth. The multiples look great as well.

Honorable mention: ELMD

#Financial

PJT- While looking at their share price gain and p/e compared to the rest of the financial sector you'd think I was crazy for calling this stock undervalued. A deeper look will point out just how undervalued they are. Through 3 quarters they've already beat 2018 and 2019's earnings combined. That puts their peg ratio at 0.7. Much too low. Charting their revenue and earnings out over the last few years paints an impressive picture of sustainable growth. 

PFSI- The number one most underpriced stock in the entire market. Period. 3.3 p/e and 0.1 peg ratio. All while exhibiting unbelievable growth and margins. Hedge funds are stuffing into this stock like a clown car, the number of funds investing in them has doubled in just one year. I believe the market has priced in a "top" of the housing market. By the time it actually starts to decline we'll see interest rates rise which should only help PFSI.

Honorable mention: OMF

#Real Estate

CBRE- Like OMF this stock got hurt by the pandemic but should be back on track this year. They have an impressive 30.5% margin of safety. The robust balance sheet supports the acquisition moves aimed at expanding their geographical reach.

#Basic Materials

GOLD- Warren Buffet was on the right track buying Barrick last year and the reasoning hasn't really changed. Massive stimulus building supports the gold bull case long term. 

Honorable mention: FMC

#Utilities

DTE- Only one utility company is expected to see EPS growth while having a forward p/e under 30, a peg ratio under 3, and decent price/cash flow. I dont have them being notably under intrinsic value but if you're going to own a utility that isnt renewable this is the one._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about dividend issue I bought ABBV EX dividend date is 1/14/2021.

Thanks in advance for help_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about leaving company with stock options 3-6 months before IPO I'll try to keep it quick

* I want to leave my company within the next few weeks because I'm miserable there and I found a new job that excites me and has better benefits.
* The company is still private and I have some stock options with a grant price that's super low. I haven't bought any yet, but I could buy about 2500 shares at any time.
* The company started IPO talks back in Sep. 2020 and according to the CEO the process could take 6-12 months, so we're about 4 months in. 
* Based on the current market, the company's trajectory, and IPO prices of similar companies recently, I could maybe make 50-100k off these stock options. So I'm really tempted to stick it out there depending on the answer to the following questions...

I read about post-termination exercise periods and I believe my company's policy is the standard 90 days. What I'm confused about is: does "exercise" mean buy or sell? If I bought all the shares I could now and then left the company before they IPO, do I have 90 days to sell those stocks? What about the lock-up period for insiders which is typically 90 days-- how does that affect the PTE period? Or once I buy my options at my set grant price, are they my shares indefinitely so I can sell whenever? 

Thanks in advance for any help, I feel like I can't ask anyone in the company for fear of tipping them off._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (Serious) does anyone else get extremely antsy before/after trading hours and especially long weekends?

There is a lot of hype around electric vehicle charging station companies, EV's that look like coffins on wheels, to some that look like something out of Blade Runner.  Why aren't electric utilities getting gobbled up?  Doesn't the electricity to power all of these new electric vehicles need to come from somewhere?  Sure a few electric utility companies have gone up in price, but why haven't the other top 10 not gained as much as EV stocks?

As The Great One likes to point out, investing isn't complicated. He's consistently preached about investing in good companies with great management or investing in within your circle of competence. Sure, he's missed out on the tech boom, but results are results. His teachings span across all generations and his quirky teachings make investing seem so simple. 

We're now in an environment that many say is a bubble (though that's been the case for 20 years), uncertainty about the FED artificially inflating the price of stocks, and an army of young investors YOLOing it all on garbage companies, perhaps exploiting how easily the market can be manipulated. But for Buffett, the dude just grabs his McDonalds sandwich each morning, heads to work, sucks down a Coke, and reads for like 8 hours...completely ignoring all the noise. Why? He's invested in good companies with good management. 

So assuming you could only invest in 6 stocks, (1 of which is completely speculative just for fun) and TOMORROW the markets shut down for 10 years, which companies would you invest in TODAY?

They just opened more restaurants in the middle east but that had literally no impact on the stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Green energy and battery stocks With biden’s administration it looks as if green energy and EV are in the IN. What etf’s stocks are we to look at that will make big moves coming in 2021. Also chinese battery stocks since they make over 70 percent of all batteries?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to build a diverse portfolio with buffet’s circle of confidence advice? To have a circle of confidence makes sense to me. I hate not knowing why my stock is dipping, and I should be confident in what I own, however I feel as though this information conflicts with the advice to “diversify your portfolio.”

How can I invest in my small circle of confidence, whilst also having a diverse portoflio across different industries? There’s no way I can be extremely confident in every possible industry._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My portfolio for the next 10 years Here’s my current breakdown after recent rebalancing. I used to be 40% in clean energy etfs at the March lows and just sold alot of them. Ive been trading in and out of ICLN, QCLN and PBW since 2009. This is the 3rd multiyear swing trade I’ve been involved with them resulting in 100% or more gains. Right now i think alt energy needs a 30% drop to shake out alot of new late money coming from hype posts on reddit and elsewhere. All of a sudden everyone knows they’re a great bet after 300% up but very few here were saying buy them in March and NOBODY on CNBC was saying buy them at any time between March and now. Only last month have i been hearing CNBC heads talking about them. Great timing!
I know everyone here loves shit like VT but i don’t waste my time(or my opportunities) with it as i do not trade China/HK, India or Russia stocks and don’t want to invest directly in their entire market aside from the stocks from China that are in some of my etfs below like for example NIO is in a few of my etfs

I trade around a core position in all of these as they outperform i move money to underperformers every few weeks or months.

21% - EWC and BBCA - Canada - Canada has a 1.5% annual population growth rate. That is 3x the US rate of 0.5%. Nobody on CNBC talks about Canada or Australia which is my next biggest holding. They will all be hyping them eventually when they look for growth and “suddenly” realize theres 2 continent sized countries with stable governments and educated people rich in natural resources and rich in natural beauty with a currently small population with massive growth potential. They also have excellent immigration systems of bringing in people based on merit, education and skills required.
Canada in particular is gaining new previously mostly frozen land as the world warms. Endless amounts of land for actual humans to live on and  land with nat resources.

17% - EWA - Australia - also a 1.5% population growth rate that is scheduled to continue at that pace for the next 10 years at least.

Only downside to my Canada and Australia etfs is they are 33% financials which i hate but i like the rest of the sector weights they have and that weighting can change if their industrials and  tech cos become bigger just like financials in the SP500 became a way smaller % weight since 2008. 

22% - Technology etfs listed in order from biggest position to smallest. I believe alot of money will come out of bloated big tech like Facebook and at the same time big tech will continue to buy small tech cos. Facebook bought 80 companies in the last few years. When boomer morons on CNBC are saying sell tech to buy banks i know i should buy more tech. With tech to me valuations are often meaningless. You are investing in groups of smart brains/thinktanks. You are actually betting on 1 or more of them inventing a time machine( or other huge advancements) one day and that stock and any etf holding it opening the next day up INFINITE %. What will the banks invent? A better way to extract money from all of us as they get free fake newly printed money from the Federal Reserve? 
I also consider clean energy etfs to basically be tech but i will list them separately.

IRBO
TDIV(yes this is big tech that pay divis, i hold it for the security of owning some megacap tech and i take the divis to buy more of these other smaller cap tech etfs)
MOON
XT

QQQJ
ARKK
ARKW
IDRV
DRIV
HAIL
TECB
PRNT

8% - individual stocks currently only 2 stocks, 70% TSLA and 30% SPCE

7% - alternative energy
ICLN
QCLN
PBW
FAN

4% - Europe 
DFE(great euro small cap mix)
EWU
GREK
EWP
FEZ
VGK
IEUR
EWD
ENOR

5% - Aerospace/Industrials, I’m proud to say i knew these were good holds(and SPCE) before Cathie Wood and Ark announced the Space etf. I will hold these going into that etf coming out and then move some of this money into the Space etf depending on the initial holdings they choose.
ITA
XAR
XLI
VIS
FTXR
IYT
PAVE

5% - mix of various etfs that i have been trading in and out of and increasing or decreasing how much i have in each based on performance. I shift money around them but always hold some of each long term. Some of these used to be a very large % of my portfolio but i recently rebalanced everything based on where we are now.

MJ - Cannabis, used to be 15% of my portfolio but now way smaller as i rode it up since March and sold most of it

XME/PICK - metals companies, also was 15% of my portfolio but with metals/materials making up 20% of EWA and 13% of EWC thats enough coverage for me.

JETS - airlines

HDV, SPYD, IDV - high divis

XLY - consumer discretionary, like it because its 21% Amazon and 18% TSLA

IYZ - telecom

ENZL - New Zealand

RYT, XLK - tech

IXJ - healthcare 

MOO - agriculture 

QQQE, QQQM

XLB, VAW, IYM - materials

ESGD, SUSL - esg 

Theres another 20 etfs i usually have in this list but don’t own right now like MTUM, SPHB, SKYY, WCLD, CLOU

I also trade short side adding hedge as we go up and for quick day or week trades but usually never short with more than 15% of my money_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Low effort electric school bus DD (BLBD) Before getting in to this I would of course like to start off by saying I am not a financial advisor, and know literally nothing about school busses or school bus manufacturing companies. A short summary of BLBD is that they make school busses which is pretty lame, but that they also make alternate fuel school busses, which is a market that they dominate. I was drawn to this company last week due to their relatively low market cap compared to their revenue and even profit per share. The stock has a market cap of around 600 million, yet revenue from 9/30/2019 - 9/30/2020 of 879 million, a tick down from the previous year that saw revenue around 1 billion dollars (downtick possibly because of Covid). Along with this, the stock has a P/E ratio of around 50, which isn't bad for an industrial stock during Covid. The final good bit of financial news is that their quarterly revenue for 6/30/20 - 9/30/20 was around 281 million, a large uptick from the previous quarter's revenue of around 190 million, and one of the best quarter's they've had since even a little before Covid. This uptick could be due to a larger demand for their alternative fuel school busses and schools opening back up in general. Anyways though I bought a little less than 9 shares of the company on Friday deciding to just dip my toes in before possibly putting in more. For some reason the stock went from being down 2% for the day to being up 18.36% after hours just before the closing of afterhours for a reason that is beyond me. The stock and company rarely sees any significant news at all, and the only reason i could find for why the stock would go up is this dude with 79 followers on seekingalpha who sports a fish profile pic posting an article saying he had a 82 dollar price target because electric and alternate fuel vehicles make valuation go brrrr. He cited that the company currently has around 76% market share in propane school busses, and 59 % market share in electric which is pretty cool. Anyway the point is that I have seen a lot worse stocks get ridiculous valuations because they make alternate fuel vehicles and apparently there is a market for alternate fuel school busses even during covid so maybe afterwards they will make even greater revenue and profit. I do not know how to put emojis on non mobile but if I did I would put some rocket ones here, BLBD stock might be worth looking at, if only to see what happens on tuesday after whatever that was that took place after hours on Friday._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the currently the best value play in the consumer discretionary sector?  I'm mainly a value investor and have been trying to increase my allocation in the consumer discretionary sector. Ebay, Qurate Retail and Tapestry are currently on my radar right now. What would be your stock picks in the sector?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All ARKs, or just one to rule them all? I've been playing with stocks for a year, so I don't know much, and I don't really invest much.  But reading advice on reddit around last March/April (investing in NIO) enabled me to continue to have an interest in it. Turns out stocks are fun when you make money! 

I use M1, and I have a pie of 5 ARKS right now.  This may be a stupid question, but should I go with just one, or is it reasonable to spread out among all 5?  I'm definitely interested in the new space ARK, and wondering if I should go all in on that ARK alone, or add it to the pie and continue to stay diversified?  Or is that kind of question one of those million dollar questions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A stock site suggestion, but with criteria Hi All, 

&#x200B;

I'm struggling to find a stocks site that has the right mixture of things I am wanting to manage my portfolios. I'm willing to spend a little, and need the following features: 

&#x200B;

1) The ability to show multiple indexes from different countries, currently UK, US and Canada. 

2) The ability to see the impact of currency fluctuations on each of my stocks. 

3) The ability to see investments, capital growth and dividend re-invested breakdown. 

4) The ability to project expected dividend payments at least 12 months into the future. 

5) The ability to create custom groups for my reporting. (As an example, I have a "speculative" grouping that I have capped at 5%, but I also split financials and technology into sub-groups). I still want them in a single portfolio for ease, but I want a pie chart to show my groupings. 

&#x200B;

I have found multiple sites that do some of these, but struggling to find somewhere that does them all. 

&#x200B;

I have even seen tons of short ideas like $DE, etc.

Does not a single industry or assst class do better when the DXY goes up?
