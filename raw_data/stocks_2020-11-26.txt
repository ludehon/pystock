 Small thank you and lament Last year I was a Crypto Currency douche. I hung out in the subs, followed ‘experts’ online and fell head over heals for the hype. I bought in early and made some small gains that went towards the renovation of my house and all round was a huge help.

My husband seeing these gains put our small amount of savings completely in my care and encouraged me to ‘invest’ further... so I did. 

Then (to keep it brief) I fell for a scam whilst ill with Covid and lost the lot. All 17k I had raised was transferred out of my account before my eyes in a split second. It was entirely my own fault as I believed an APP to be real. It was fraudulent and took everything. 

We contacted the police and the fraud unit set about tracking down where our crypto was held. Turns out my report has uncovered a multi million dollar fraud scheme based in Chile... and their government won’t do a damn thing about it. 

Today that crypto would be worth near $30k 

Now completely scared from being part of an unregulated sector, I turned to stocks and this sub.

Thank you. 

It’s not much compared but these past few months of gains from APPL, AMD and now PLTR have kept my key worker husband and I afloat during Covid. We are currently building back up slowly at $7k so far. 

Yes losing what would have been $30k today stings like hell, but you guys have given us a lifeline I will never be able to thank you for enough.

Edit: so are we all pulling out of PLTR today or not? lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An Explanation of $TSLA's Recent Surge [Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VOLV-A.ST Hey there,

I went to look for GAP which crashed hard today in my current sheet I'm operating off of and it was absent. If anybody has a master list of all the publicly traded symbols I'd be very grateful. 

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Swing Trading With APPL vs Passive Value Investing ? Please help me confirm my assumptions – 

I have a brokerage account worth about $20K. Most of it invested in well-known stocks. It’s been hovering around 10 to 15 % (YTD), depending on market. Sometimes it goes well below 5% but it does not bother me because I’m not afraid of loosing this money and most of the stocks I trade are bound to bounce back at some point. Plus, this strategy enables me to be hands-off and not have to closely watch the market. 

I recently realized that I could be making better use of my money by swing trading. 

For example, if I purchase AAPL at today’s price of $116 and even if it goes up by $5 in a weeks time, I could possibly be gaining around 4.5% ($20K/$116 = 172 stocks times $5 = $860). Now, if I’m able to repeat this process few times over a month or two, this would be better than just purchasing a few high potential stocks and let them sit through ups and downs. (Let me know if you can think of other stocks where this logic is applicable).  

On the flip side, if the stock goes down dramatically for whatever reason, I’m not too concerned as it’s not a meme stock and I can set stop loss. If stock does dips too much, that’s an opportunity for me to buy additional stocks. 

Please let me know what you think!

There are a few solid “pure park” stocks like $SEAS, $FUN and $SIX that have plenty of upside. Other “mixed” tickers include $DIS and $CMCSA.  On the OTC front is $PRKA. 

I’ve held these for almost a year and they are all posting solid gains ($PRKA is bar coding, but not volatile.)  

In the past 3 months, $SEAS (46.67%), $FUN (34.53%) and $SIX (58.57%) have delivered consistent returns for me and have balanced out red days in other sectors. $DIS (12.44%) and $CMCSA (16.25%) have yielded less, but they are also more diversified companies with stakes in film, television and streaming beyond the parks. (Percentages based on my portfolio.)

Theme parks are a HUGE industry and, though the shut-downs have brought big losses, many properties have successfully re-opened, remained so, and are planning for a big year of new attractions and greater potential attendance in 2021. 

This sector started to move substantially again around the beginning of November. Keep it in mind for investing.

In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition "will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket."  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.[why square jumped 5%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/25/why-square-stock-just-jumped-5/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XIAOMI great prospect for 2021?

The lead is "M&A Wave Awaits Software." Any suggestions for other companies that may look tasty to buy up by those gazillion $$$ tech name brands? As above, if Slack is on the radar, who's next?  Ideas are most welcome!  :-)

The main holdout against mall-owner PREIT’s plan to restructure its debt burden has dropped its objection to the proposal, opening a likely path for the deal’s approval.

Strategic Value Partners, an investment firm that specializes in distressed debt, said in a filing late last week, with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., that it would not oppose the plan, which frees up as much as $150 million in new borrowing by PREIT and gives the company more time to pay back its existing loans.

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, as PREIT is formally known, is scheduled to ask Judge Karen B. Owens to approve the proposal at a hearing on Nov. 30.

The hearing had been originally set for this week, but was postponed to complete paperwork._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to sell PTLR Let me explain with a simple comparison. I know these industries are not similar at all, but it's to help put things into perspective mathematically. 

&#x200B;

Tesla has a revenue of 20 billion. Tesla has a market cap of 544 billion. This is an extremely overvalued stock for a multitude of reasons, but just looking at it mathematically and their revenue projections for a year on don't add up to their market cap. Basically, Tesla's market cap exceeds Tesla's revenue 27 times over. 

Palantir has a revenue of 800 million, but let's just say 1 billion. In their earning report, they said they can release their revenue 50%! I believe them 100%. A revenue increase from 1 billion of 50% is 500 million right? Maybe there is something fundamental that I'm not understanding, but I just don't see how Palantir can get from 1 billion revenue to their 50 billion market cap. I understand that stocks are basically a way of betting on future potential growth, but I don't see how Palantir can grow 500% in the next 5 years even. Growing to that size in a decade is more realistic to reach that market cap. 

Just know that when you buy PTLR right now, you are betting on basic momentum continuing forward or the continued hype around it. You are not betting on anything related to the company at this juncture. 

Also, I sold today and made a 100k officially just off of this stock! Thank you random Redditor who recommended this when it was at 15 dollars._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Apps For Recommendation Hi, I came here for a advice. I’m from Europe (Poland to be exact) and as my stock app I’ve been using Plus500. And recently they just add a expiry date to my position and when I bought this stock there wasn’t a expiry date. Also this overnight funding is getting very expensive. So I would like to ask what other apps would you suggest for me that doesn’t have those payments or has maybe lower? Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
