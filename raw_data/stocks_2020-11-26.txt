 Is over diversification bad? Are less stocks more profitable? Starting a new portfolio **In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less > more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

The second holding is Apple, is there anybody that doesn’t know this company? They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don’t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

Zoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.

I know I didn’t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. 

So here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

We've all seen tesla rise almost 50% since the announcement of it's inclusion in sp500.    
The addition date is **18th of December.**    
So what exactly does that mean happens now, on 18th, after 18th?    
Does the sp500 index buy shares to track it?    
Have they started already? Or do they wait until 18th December?

What about etfs?

Thank you and Happy Holidays!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can anyone explain this scene in the 1987 film "Wall Street?" I have seen this film plenty of times but am not sure I have completely understood all of the underlying mechanics of this scene.  Pardon my ignorance, this is probably obvious stuff to a lot of you.

Anyway, 

&#x200B;

Gordon Gekko sends his broker Bud Fox to obtain information about rival investor Larry Wildman.

&#x200B;

Once Gekko learns from Fox that Wildman intends to buy a steel company in Pennsylvania, this exchange starts between Gekko and his broker, Fox:

&#x200B;

Gekko: "**Buy 1500 July 50 calls. Start buying 1000 share blocks and take it up to 50 dollars.  When it reaches 50, give a little taste to your friends.  Then call the Wall Street chronicle and tell them Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel."**

Gekko then instructs his in house brokers to buy the same stock covertly.  We then see a montage of Anacott's stock climbing during the trading day culminating in Fox telling his associates to promote the stock to their clients.

&#x200B;

1). Did Gekko ask for 15 contracts of 100 shares each at the strike price of 50, or 1500 contracts?  Why July?

2) Are the "1000 share blocks" separate stock purchases in addition to the purchase of the call options?

3). Did he intend to sell the calls after the stock crossed the strike price, or exercise his option to buy?

4) was the purpose of all this to cause the stock to drop sharply eventually?

Why would someone offer an SPW at a price higher than the current buy price? why would the first nation people accept the price being higher for their 50,000 SPW shares?

Anyway I heard that 4 weeks ago, 3 historical drilling sites that detected a very considerable g/tonne/m of gold were awaiting geological valuation. This analysis would take a month to complete as per their last news.  


Does this announcement to first ensure the permissions of the MFN on the land imply they struct gold? That they got good results on the evaluation?

Everyone deep down knows that Tesla is overvalued and that to justify their current valuation they would have to pretty much absorb a majority of the car market.

To keep this question less theoretical, I will use my own situation with PLTR. Moreover, I am more of a long-term, part-time/free-time investor that just wants to do something useful with his money.

FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is an emotion that partially lead me to buy PLTR at an average price of a little below 18$ per stock. I say 'partially' as I know the company since quite a few years back and I understand what it does. I know that its management is top-notch and that it has been increasing its private sector client base a lot lately (almost 50/50 public sector/private sector split).

Now, PLTR was the first individual stock that I have ever bought. I had only bought ETFs up until that point.

The price increase of PLTR has been a huge hit for me (in a totally good way). Being used to the constant, but less steep growth of ETFs, you can imagine the contrast.

Now I am torn between actually investing more into PLTR (soon it might reach a price twice my average one from above). I don't plan selling it for at least a few years, maybe more. Would it be FOMO at the current price point? I have read that it might dip soon, and all that stuff. But I find it hard to predict.

Long term, do you think that buying something like NIO (I know, another meme stonk, but I picked it for the sake of this example) might provide greater returns? If TSLA wasn't that costly, I would even consider it, but I really don't think it has that much growth potential, compared to either PLTR or NIO. Buying NIO still feels like FOMO, though.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A case for Oil, a forgotten stock option? Hi all

I am a frequent lurker here on r/stocks and regularly see the popular/meme stocks being posted as well as mentions of airline/green energy with the idea of the economy reopening and Biden's Green New Deal on the horizon, but I very rarely see oil mentioned.  

The typical assertion is to buy low and sell high.. Well there's never been a bigger low for oil than there was a month ago during the widespread lockdowns.  Negative oil prices earlier in the year and low demand has caused many companies to rack up huge debts. But with lockdowns ending, stimulus on its way and vaccines around the corner, the price of oil has been increasing this week, along with share prices. I think there are some good players available for people:

Premier Oil - this is a UK company which has rise over 100% in the past 3 weeks, from its low of 10.6p.  Premier had accumulated huge debts to the tune of nearly £2 billion, however recently shareholders approved a takeover by the company Chrysoar which is set to be announced in Q1 2021.  This takeover will clear Premier Oils debts and establish establish itself as the biggest energy company in the UK.

These smaller oil companies are typically more responsive to the oil prices then larger, well diversified companies. With oil prices rising nearly 50% in recent weeks, market cap increasing with the takeover and the share price taking a 15% fall, following huge increases, this company could surpass its 60p valuation at the beginning of covid making it a strong multibag candidate.

Shell / BP / Total - whilst these companies might not see the same returns as Premier Oil and other smaller oil companies, these major oil companies are still undervalued compared to their pre-covid levels and are seeing strong gains in recent weeks. 

These companies are well diversified in many areas of green energy, such as solar and wind technologies, often taking commanding shares in leading renewable energy companies, meaning they will be sticking around  for a while longer.  Their reduced share price through covid could make these companies a stable or positive investment as economies begin opening back up, with further lockdowns being unlikely and higher oil prices to follow once the vaccines are distributed. Finally, their large dividends will likely be a great return once stimulus begins and companies return strong profits in the first half of 2021. 

This is just my opinion as a relatively new investor (~2 years) and so I would love to hear more opinions or insight from you guys on these companies. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving to any American readers._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla has surged past $525 billion in market value and could soon overtake Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Here's why that's astounding https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-market-capitalization-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2020-11?amp

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

Would it be illegal for Cohen to buy 10% of the shares, offer to buy GME for the current price, sell his 10% stake for at least 10 times more during the short squeeze, and either walk away with the company for essentially a 10% initial investment, or more likely, make a tenfold return?

2. I am a senior in college and have accepted a job where they will match 6% investment into my 401k so I will at least be putting in 6% no matter what
3. I want to put 10% of my salary into savings, 30% into investing (401k and personal investing). I know 40% of my salary is a lot but I'm grateful for a good job out of college, I can live easily off of 60%

I am really interested in the stock market and have put $750 into my account (had a rough first few months but recently moved into the green all time). I feel like there's not much of a point in a 401k if I am willing to spend the time and invest the money myself, so I just want to get a little advice on putting my money in a 401k vs personally investing. Thanks for any help!

It seems like Amazon is literally everywhere and has every single product you can imagine, plus the stock price they have is pretty high (not saying overvalued, just high from my perspective). 

Can you think of any way that this company could still grow? 

I thought about expanding more its market in Asia, as far as I'm concerned it isn't as popular there, right? 
Also, I thought on an improvement in delivery, for instance, partnering with companies like Workhorse to use their drone technology and renew their way of delivery? 

Those are the only scenarios where I could see Amazon growing even more, other than that I think that such a monolithic company has to stagnate at a certain point in terms of growth.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Flooded market First, all of the following is based on gut feeling and 0 empirical data, which I know goes against the unspoken rules of this sub but I would like some of the experienced investors/traders' opinions.

&#x200B;

I, like many others got into the stock market last March, and noticed considerable hype concerning stocks and trading overall among some peers, which I expected to die soon after the pandemic situation settles. Fast forward today and people are giving stock advice on tiktok and a serious amount of people are into the stock market. Since I am new myself, I understand I can be biased since I have no reference points, so I would like to ask the oldies of this sub if they could confirm my observations.Secondly, my key take if this is to continue, is that I would start looking at stocks purely from a supply/demand perspective, because ultimately it is what price action boils down to. I have been discouraged from following this strategy since institutional traders dominate said price action, but with more retail traders entering the market I am reconsidering; many 'meme' stocks with no fundamental catalysts are soaring simply because people are buying. In addition, there are talks of negative interest rates in Denmark and the UK, if other countries follow  I think the stock market would appear even more attractive to individuals.

So I’m looking for companies that has both sides, analog and digital._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hidden gem or doomed stock? Hi Guys, I'm quite new here. Recently I 'found' the stock Vallourec  (VK).

This stock seems to have a lot of potential. It was at 112 euro/share in january, went all the way down to 11,5 untill november, and now it's going up again (28/share now).

It might be a stock to keep an eye on. I need to do more research about it but I thought it might be good to share so everybody could give their opinion and maybe give some advice to a beginner.

To be fair, the stock has been going downhill way before corona even happened so it might not 'just bounce back' to it's level of pre-corona.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Small thank you and lament Last year I was a Crypto Currency douche. I hung out in the subs, followed ‘experts’ online and fell head over heals for the hype. I bought in early and made some small gains that went towards the renovation of my house and all round was a huge help.

My husband seeing these gains put our small amount of savings completely in my care and encouraged me to ‘invest’ further... so I did. 

Then (to keep it brief) I fell for a scam whilst ill with Covid and lost the lot. All 17k I had raised was transferred out of my account before my eyes in a split second. It was entirely my own fault as I believed an APP to be real. It was fraudulent and took everything. 

We contacted the police and the fraud unit set about tracking down where our crypto was held. Turns out my report has uncovered a multi million dollar fraud scheme based in Chile... and their government won’t do a damn thing about it. 

Today that crypto would be worth near $30k 

Now completely scarred from being part of an unregulated sector, I turned to stocks and this sub.

Thank you. 

It’s not much compared but these past few months of gains from APPL, AMD and now PLTR have kept my key worker husband and I afloat during Covid. We are currently building back up slowly at $7k so far. 

Yes losing what would have been $30k today stings like hell, but you guys have given us a lifeline I will never be able to thank you for enough.

Edit: so are we all pulling out of PLTR today or not? lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An Explanation of $TSLA's Recent Surge [Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VOLV-A.ST Hey there,

I went to look for GAP which crashed hard today in my current sheet I'm operating off of and it was absent. If anybody has a master list of all the publicly traded symbols I'd be very grateful. 

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Swing Trading With APPL vs Passive Value Investing ? Please help me confirm my assumptions – 

I have a brokerage account worth about $20K. Most of it invested in well-known stocks. It’s been hovering around 10 to 15 % (YTD), depending on market. Sometimes it goes well below 5% but it does not bother me because I’m not afraid of loosing this money and most of the stocks I trade are bound to bounce back at some point. Plus, this strategy enables me to be hands-off and not have to closely watch the market. 

I recently realized that I could be making better use of my money by swing trading. 

For example, if I purchase AAPL at today’s price of $116 and even if it goes up by $5 in a weeks time, I could possibly be gaining around 4.5% ($20K/$116 = 172 stocks times $5 = $860). Now, if I’m able to repeat this process few times over a month or two, this would be better than just purchasing a few high potential stocks and let them sit through ups and downs. (Let me know if you can think of other stocks where this logic is applicable).  

On the flip side, if the stock goes down dramatically for whatever reason, I’m not too concerned as it’s not a meme stock and I can set stop loss. If stock does dips too much, that’s an opportunity for me to buy additional stocks. 

Please let me know what you think!

Despite the vaccine news, vaccinating the US population remains to be a challenge.  Not only are we talking about a production issue, but not all Americans are convinced that the vaccines being put out for emergency approval by the FDA are safe.

All this to remind us that recovering from this pandemic is going to take time just as it will take time to rebuild the economy.  The impact of COVID remains to be the biggest question mark as of now.  That said, this may be an important reminder to keep in mind when making your trading/investment decisions.

One that I could not form an opinion on is the awaited SCOTUS decision on Oracle vs. Google: it would seem that decision in Oracle’s favor would push ORCL higher and GOOG lower, while a decision in Google’s favor seems to be already priced in, but I cannot quite tell when a decision may come down and if there is any reasonable opportunity here.

I am currently working on a project about Pfizer, and we have to present our findings. We noticed quite a few articles about how Pfizer is undervalued.

I found this article but having a hard time making any sense of it. I would really appreciate your help. Thanks!

I sold to open a covered call today @ .70 or $70.  Of course, the stock then rose more than I anticipated.  If I buy to close the same option which is now worth .90 or $90, I will close the option and take a $20 loss.  Is that correct?  

Thank you in advance for the help._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does anyone feel bitter about missing out? There is so much FOMO going on with the meme stocks, especially PLTR. Meanwhile my investments have barely moved in a long time. And yet, I am scared that the moment I will try to get in on the action, then the trend will reverse and I get burned. I am just wondering, are there any fellow investors here that are sitting on the sidelines regretting at every new 15% PLTR or TSLA, NIO etc increase that they haven't joined?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Theme Park Stocks When considering COVID recovery stocks, I often read about general entertainment including cruise ships and movie theaters but very rarely see much about theme park stocks. There are a few solid “pure park” stocks like $SEAS, $FUN and $SIX that have plenty of upside. Other “mixed” tickers include $DIS and $CMCSA.  On the OTC front is $PRKA. 

I’ve held these for almost a year and they are all posting solid gains ($PRKA is bar coding, but not volatile.)  

In the past 3 months, $SEAS (46.67%), $FUN (34.53%) and $SIX (58.57%) have delivered consistent returns for me and have balanced out red days in other sectors. $DIS (12.44%) and $CMCSA (16.25%) have yielded less, but they are also more diversified companies with stakes in film, television and streaming beyond the parks. (Percentages based on my portfolio.)

Theme parks are a HUGE industry and, though the shut-downs have brought big losses, many properties have successfully re-opened, remained so, and are planning for a big year of new attractions and greater potential attendance in 2021. 

This sector started to move substantially again around the beginning of November. Keep it in mind for investing. I’ve been glad to own a stake during the red days, I love the industry and I believe it to be a better bet than even cruise lines due to the seemingly successful mitigation of COVID-19 issues.  

Anyone else out there going long now on theme parks?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just Getting Started I just downloaded RH and I am absolutely in love. I have always been a numbers guy and I am very intrigued with stocks, companies, and markets.

Article from Investopedia two days ago: “(TSLA) will be joining the S&P 500 on Dec. 1. This is a significant moment for the company, and it is being spun as both a validation of Musk's technology and recognition that electric vehicles (EVs) will be the future.”

Article from the Wall Street Journal on 11/16: “Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has taken another step to turning the Silicon Valley electric-vehicle maker into a mainstream car maker, parking the company in the S&P 500 index.

It marks a milestone for the company that over the course of its 17 years has sought to overcome cash flow problems and defy skeptics from Wall Street and Detroit.

(Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort Avoiding low effort)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Square Jumped 5% The 317x earnings criticism is a fair point.  Would love to hear opinions on why this guy is right and why he is wrong. 

What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a "definitive agreement" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition "will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket."  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.[why square jumped 5%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/25/why-square-stock-just-jumped-5/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XIAOMI great prospect for 2021?

The main holdout against mall-owner PREIT’s plan to restructure its debt burden has dropped its objection to the proposal, opening a likely path for the deal’s approval.

Strategic Value Partners, an investment firm that specializes in distressed debt, said in a filing late last week, with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., that it would not oppose the plan, which frees up as much as $150 million in new borrowing by PREIT and gives the company more time to pay back its existing loans.

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, as PREIT is formally known, is scheduled to ask Judge Karen B. Owens to approve the proposal at a hearing on Nov. 30.

The hearing had been originally set for this week, but was postponed to complete paperwork._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to sell PTLR Let me explain with a simple comparison. I know these industries are not similar at all, but it's to help put things into perspective mathematically. 

&#x200B;

Tesla has a revenue of 20 billion. Tesla has a market cap of 544 billion. This is an extremely overvalued stock for a multitude of reasons, but just looking at it mathematically and their revenue projections for a year on don't add up to their market cap. Basically, Tesla's market cap exceeds Tesla's revenue 27 times over. 

Palantir has a revenue of 800 million, but let's just say 1 billion. In their earning report, they said they can release their revenue 50%! I believe them 100%. A revenue increase from 1 billion of 50% is 500 million right? Maybe there is something fundamental that I'm not understanding, but I just don't see how Palantir can get from 1 billion revenue to their 50 billion market cap. I understand that stocks are basically a way of betting on future potential growth, but I don't see how Palantir can grow 500% in the next 5 years even. Growing to that size in a decade is more realistic to reach that market cap. 

Just know that when you buy PTLR right now, you are betting on basic momentum continuing forward or the continued hype around it. You are not betting on anything related to the company at this juncture.
