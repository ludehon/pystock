>Robinhood Markets, the trading platform that’s proved popular with novice investors, has asked banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

>The company is aiming to go public as soon as the first quarter of 2021, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

>The company’s plans could change and it might decide not to pursue an IPO, the people said.

>A representative for Robinhood declined to comment.

>Robinhood raised an additional $460 million in a series G funding round, lifting its valuation to $11.7 billion, the company said in September. Robinhood’s investors include Sequoia, DST Global, Ribbit Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures. and D1 Capital Partners.

>An IPO would follow a huge boom in volume on the platform, with stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic driving up retail trading. Robinhood has also tapped into a new demographic -- millennial and Gen-Z traders. Robinhood has 13 million accounts on its platform, which allows for trading in options, gold and cryptocurrencies as well as equities and funds.

>Larry Tabb, head of market structure research for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note that Robinhood’s targeting of millennials and its business model will increasingly draw the attention of other brokers.

>“Yet competing versus Robinhood will be difficult,” Tabb said.

>For More: Robinhood Rise Brings Setbacks of Irate Traders, U.S. Probes

>Founded by two Stanford University graduates, Robinhood declares on its website that it is “on a mission to democratize finance for all.” The company has experienced some growing pains.

>In the first half of this year, U.S. consumer protection agencies received more than 400 complaints about Robinhood -- roughly four times more than competitors such as the brokerage units of Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments. The grievances, obtained via a public records request to the Federal Trade Commission, depict novice investors in over their heads, struggling to understand why they’ve lost money on stock options or had shares liquidated to pay off margin loans.

For some of you that hold stalwart companies that refuse to not pay dividends or cut the dividend ($KO, $PEP, $HSY, $MMM, $UPS, etc.), you usually read that reinvesting them back into the stock may be the best thing and so you just set it to DRIP (if your broker has such a plan for you to be able to do that) and forget about it. But for some of you that aren't reinvesting dividends and aren't living off of you dividend payments, are you just keeping the cash in your portfolio as firepower for the next big investment you want to make? Are you taking dividend payments from company A and using it to buy stock in company B because you think you can get a better return sooner with company B? At the end of the day it's still cash that is being given to you, shareholder, and you have to decide what is best to do with it.

Sherrill, McKinley Lead Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Access to Telehealth Services https://sherrill.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-sherrill-mckinley-lead-bipartisan-legislation-increase-access-telehealth

The subject of telehealth seems to have an overwhelming bipartisan support continuing post-pandemic. What would this spell long-term for telehealth companies like Teladoc and Amwell?

> This summer, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) laid out specific policy priorities to ensure Medicare beneficiaries continue to access telehealth services even when the COVID-19 pandemic ends. One of these priorities is to give the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand the list of providers eligible to offer telehealth to their patients.

> “This legislation removes unnecessary statutory barriers that restrict patients’ access to care and empower patients and their providers to decide on the best care options,” said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO of ATA. “As the only organization exclusively dedicated to the advancement of telehealth, the ATA commends Representatives Sherrill and McKinley for introducing the Expanded Telehealth Access Act.”

> “Ensuring access to quality health care is more important now than ever. All too often people who live in rural communities in West Virginia don’t have access to the health care specialists they need,” said Rep. McKinley. “It is crucial that such access via telehealth not end abruptly once the public health emergency ends.”

> According to the CDC, telehealth services have been particularly valuable for vulnerable populations, especially those with compromised immune systems or in rural areas far from a provider. The CDC also notes that expanded telehealth availability is likely to increase health equity. 

> “COVID-19 has underscored the need to provide timely and reliable patient care through telehealth services,” said Rep. Riggleman. “I have been at the forefront of expanding telehealth during my time in Congress, and I am proud to be an original sponsor of this legislation that will expand access to telehealth services to rural and underserved communities. This bill will go a long way to remove barriers and bolster healthcare for both patients and providers.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for a live excel stock screener Hello everyone, I came here because I figured if I couldn't find one reddit could.

Anchorage Capital Group also acquired 2.95 million shares. That follows purchases by other hedge funds including Soros Fund Management, which snapped up 18.5 million shares.
Palantir shares rose as much as 18% in intraday trading on Tuesday. The stock has gained over 155% since it went public in September.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a privately held business. The Denver-based company, which sells data analysis tools to governments and companies has climbed about 77% since the U.S. election as investors were optimistic about Palantir’s prospects after Joe Biden was elected president.

The FTSE 250 price for the same stock is £11.98.

Which represents nearly a 15% discount over the equivalent S&P 500 stock.

The two stocks are essentially the same - just listed on different exchanges. They have the same voting rights etc. However, there is a 15% spread.

Is it right in assuming that the two prices will eventually come back together and sit around the same level? Is the spread caused by volatility and uncertainty etc? 

If so, naturally, you'd expect the FTSE 250 price from here to gravitate towards the S&P 500 price - even if they meet in the middle at £12.90 or so?

Any thoughts on why there's such a significant spread when the two stocks are for all intense purposes, the exact same stock with the exact same rights and dividends; just listed on two exchanges. 

If it's just natural divergence and a natural spread, then it's possible there could be a 10%-15% upside on the FTSE 250 stock just from the currency conversion spread?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Calculating investment gains correctly accounting for new investments throughout the year? This might be a silly question.  I know the easy way to calculate my ROI in my portfolio.  If I started with 60k in my portfolio and didn't touch it all year, it grew 20k and ended with 80k I would just take (80000-60000)/60000 which would be a 33% gain on the year.

However, if I started with 60k, invested 100k in different stocks, and ended with 200k I obviously wouldn't do the same formula.  Is there an easy calculation for this?  Also, I have everything in Amerirpise but I'm new to them and find their reports hard to figure out.  Besides using mint, are there better apps or software to track just my investments?

I noticed that all of today, VTI has had a lead of nearly .4 to .5% on SPY, GSPC and even ITOT. This is such a large margin in my opinion. I own both VTI and ITOT in two different accounts. Can this really be the result of Tesla being only in VTI? Or is this more the aggregate result of the small cap stocks in VTI pushing it up. I don't really care about the negligible financial impact in the short term, as I'm invested for 20 plus years.

Thanks !!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Next Big Thing kinda post! My portfolio is pretty much mainly made up on Tech and EV stocks. I’m looking to invest in 2 or 3 more, ideally in a different sector to diversify a little but it’s not crucial. The hope, like everyone, is to find the ‘next big thing’ I have quite a high risk tolerance. 

After doing some research my thoughts on one’s that could do well are
SBE - Dunno if Tesla will take away much of their market though
ICLN - Seems expensive atm from what people are saying
PLTR - This one seems pretty high risk but with the chance of strong returns
BLDP
LIT
FAN

I know some of these are connected to EV and Tech. Lithium and batteries seems like it will grow. 

SQ is another one. I dunno if people think this will continue to do well or if it’s at a pretty high price currently?

Be great to get people’s thoughts on the above stocks and any others that have great potential that I’ve failed to mention. I’m open to any sector tbh. Clean Energy seems like it’s going to only grow but I don’t know much about the space and I’m struggling to find anything I’m really confident on, hence ICLN and FAN.

Hi everyone, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and get paid to do this. 

For this week I look at DraftKings, let me know what names you would like me to do next week as well as your feedback. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings.

**What’s new:**   DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42%  year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced  $131mn-$133mn range. [(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm) DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.

Also  with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to  $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn  (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This  range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which  could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next.  Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all  states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars  aren’t disrupted.

**Valuation Methodology:**  I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear  is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be  exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market  will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market  will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing  on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s  market share of the  future betting markets. I believe **DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,**  therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the  best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated  Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to  continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much  of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors  garnering a  better understanding of how \[that\] ultimately flows to net  revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything  beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to  disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.

I  try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth   figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market   because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a   pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M   to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly   changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects   expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’   ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth.

**How is the Street valuing DKNG?:**  Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on  equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a  Discounted Cash Flow  model.

Morgan  Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37  valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech  multiple.

Deutsche Bank models  DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA,  discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA  from their current forecast is worth \~$4 to their Price  Target and  every multiple point is \~$2.

**Our Model:**  I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit  DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth  rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc.  because **DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23**.

If  the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates   from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to   capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%   EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I   get a valuation of around $39, implying \~9% downside. Let’s look closer:

I  start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market  size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn –  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from   Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR’s in the previous paragraph   and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate  this  growth profile as my Base case. I don’t want you to stay fixated  on the  \~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall  market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but  trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years  out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market  experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case  studies. We get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates.

**Is this a reasonable TAM:**  Deutsche Bank is a noted Bear on this sort of sports betting TAM Share  argument in the 20bn to 25bn  range for sports betting. They say in  their “A Lot of Unfounded  “Expectations” at a Lofty Price; Remain Sell”  Note on Penn National,  “Said simply, in the period from March 2019  through February 2020, prior  to the pandemic, the per adult spend on  sports betting (GGR/NJ adult  population) was $51. Given there are 240  mm adults in the US, to arrive  at even a $20bn TAM, implied that not  only does every state legalize and  all 240 mm adults can bet sports on  their mobile phones, but that … the  adult spend grows by \~65% from this  $51 level”. I look at the idea of full legalization and spend per adult  in the table below.

To get to our $20bn TAM, indeed every  US adult would need to be  spending $84 a year on sports betting and  online gambling. This ties out  with DB’s 65% figure.

Next  I estimate the DraftKings’ EBITDA based on the market size and  their  share of this future market. An important point is DKNG’s  promotions  and how much it subtracts from top-line revenue. We use 20%  here, but  management has stated in the past that promotions are  generally in the  high 20%’s. We give DKNG credit for being able to  continue to decrease  promotional activity in the future, so for our 2025  EBITDA analysis we  settle on 20%. Just for reference, promotions were  \~26% in Q1 and Q2 of  this year.

I use a healthy 30%  EBITDA margin across all levels of market share  and market size. As you  can see, our Base Case is $785 mm in EBITDA for  2025. Not bad for a company expected to have over negative $400mm in  EBITDA for 2020.

Finally, given the current stock price of $42.84 at close on 11/13, what   is the implied 2025E EBITDA multiple for all these scenarios? 

 Every additional turn in the EBITDA multiple adds \~$2 to our price  and  every additional $100 mm in 2025 EBITDA adds \~$5. If the market  grows  by only 15%/ year with lower market share and EBITDA margins in  our  Bear Case, we get a valuation of $14. Likewise, if the market grows  at  45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case,  we get a $75 valuation. 

**Upside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations
2. Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue
3. DKNG is able to take outsized market share
4. Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting

**Downside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO
2. TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable
3. Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue
4. Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend
5. Negative legislative outcomes

Profits have been lackluster in recent years without a new hit game, but even then reports show increase in profitability.

The factors which led me to a purchase are

-great demand of Nvidia and AMD cards, almost everything is out of stock
-great demand for new consoles. PS5 is out of stock and hard to find.
-cyberpunk received great reviews in the summer by journalists testing beta versions. The game will be polished (pun intended) to perfection. I expect lots of 10/10 reviews

Q4 profits will be boosted by additional merch which became available and the release of the game in Q4. As new generation console titles are rare, I believe sales momentum will continue in Q1 2021.

WASHINGTON—Chinese companies with shares traded in America would be required to use auditors overseen by U.S. regulators or face being kicked off exchanges under a plan being drafted by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposal, which is likely to be issued for public comment in December, would address the disparate treatment that applies to Chinese companies going public in the U.S. The firms have long been able to sell shares here, yet their auditors violate a key investor protection: China hasn’t allowed their work to be inspected.

Auditor supervision has been overseen by a special watchdog—the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board—since the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. nearly 20 years ago. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken different tacks to try to get China’s cooperation with the PCAOB, from suing its audit firms to get information on fraudulent companies, to negotiating with Chinese regulators and issuing public warnings to U.S. investors about the problem.

Now, the SEC’s proposal would put the onus on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq NDAQ -0.23% Stock Market to require compliance with the audit inspections—or bar a new Chinese company from listing. Those with shares already traded here would have a few years to comply before possibly losing their listing.

The SEC is moving fast to propose key elements of the plan before the departure of Chairman Jay Clayton, who announced Monday that he plans to leave by the end of December.

China has said it is worried about auditors revealing strategic secrets held by domestic firms, some of which are majority-owned by the Chinese government. The country put up a new hurdle this year, implementing a law that prevents its citizens and companies from complying with overseas securities regulators without the permission of its own market supervisor and other components of the Chinese government.


To address that issue, the SEC’s plan includes a separate proposal to allow Chinese firms to get a second review of their books by an accounting firm based in a country where auditors comply with PCAOB oversight. The audit firm doing the work would likely assume liability for the opinion it provides, and the PCAOB could check the work.

The details for such “co-audits” would need to be spelled out in a regulation. The SEC would have to address obstacles to such arrangements, including the political and regulatory risks the second auditor might encounter in China.

“How do you meet the U.S. goal which is an audit subject to a meaningful inspection, and what appears to be the Chinese goal of limiting the access to information held in China?” said Paul Leder, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier and former head of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs.

Another wild card: It’s unclear how much China still values access to U.S. exchanges for its companies, and thus how much it is willing to negotiate. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which went public on the NYSE in 2014, chose to raise $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. Ant Group Co., the fast-growing financial-technology giant that grew out of Alibaba, was set to raise $34 billion in Shanghai and Hong Kong before the Chinese government halted the deal.

The SEC’s proposals would take months to adopt and implement, and Mr. Clayton’s successor and the Biden administration could seek to tweak the approach.

The SEC’s anticipated moves follow recommendations issued by a panel of U.S. policy makers in July that suggested how to address the inspections standoff. The panel, known as the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, recommended tightening the exchanges’ standards for listing Chinese companies.


NYSE and Nasdaq have declined to voluntarily change their listing rules as the President’s Working Group suggested, people familiar with the matter said. Such a move could have taken effect more quickly than a new SEC regulation.

Nasdaq officials felt they couldn’t implement the listing rule without clearer guidance from the SEC about how co-audits would work, a person familiar with the matter said. Nasdaq in May moved to raise its minimum requirements for listing companies from countries where PCAOB cannot inspect auditors, a step that could discourage initial public offerings by smaller Chinese firms. NYSE declined to comment.

Booting Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets would hurt the revenues of NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE 0.36% and Nasdaq. The shares could still trade over the counter.

Both exchanges earn annual listing fees from such companies and benefit from the trading activity that comes from their shares. More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.


Congress is weighing its own solution. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements—or face delisting from Nasdaq and NYSE. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the House as an amendment to a defense-spending bill.

While the SEC plans to publicize its proposed actions in December, the agency will likely issue other proposals directing public companies and mutual funds to amplify their disclosure of the audit-inspection risks associated with China, the people said. Those other proposals may not be finished before Mr. Clayton leaves, the people said._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

Here are some important details:

The number of shares available at the IPO price is limited. Receiving this message and completing the form is only the first step in the process and does not guarantee that you will be able to participate.

If more Hosts express an interest in participating than the program is able to accommodate, eligible Hosts may be invited to register by the Administrator based on tenure, as determined by the year they first hosted on Airbnb. Registration will be available on a first come, first served basis, by invitation from the Administrator.

When the program reaches capacity, registration with the Administrator will be closed. If this occurs before you complete the registration steps you will not be able to participate.

Program capacity permitting, Hosts who complete the above form will receive information about the program directly from the Administrator in the coming weeks. By submitting the form, you consent to us sharing your responses with the Administrator.

We expect that there will be a minimum purchase amount of at least $300 in addition to a maximum purchase amount. We may further limit the amount any one Host can purchase depending on total demand for the program and Airbnb’s initial public offering price.

There are certain regulatory and other requirements that may restrict the ability of a Host to participate in the program. Hosts must be United States residents to be eligible.

“Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest academic research into retail investing.

When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found.

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did Tesla's stock jump 13% in after hours trading as a result of being added to the S&P 500?

Soros Fund Management and Third Point each bought more than 18 million and 2.4 million shares of Palantir respectively.

“Soros Fund Management, run by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, and Third Point, the firm led by occasional activist investor Dan Loeb, both disclosed late Friday that they own shares of Palantir.

The Soros investment was worth about $175.3 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That works out to a purchase price of $9.50 a share. Palantir's stock is currently trading at just under $16 a share, so the Soros stake is now valued at about $294 million.

Palantir went public through a direct listing of existing stock on the New York Stock Exchange. That means Palantir didn't need to sell new shares through a more traditional initial public offering. It's how Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) also started trading on Wall Street.

Shares of Palantir have more than doubled from their so-called reference price of $7.25 a share on the day of the direct listing. Palantir is now worth nearly $30 billion.”

Airbnb is looking to go public 12 years after its founding and with $6.4 billion in equity and debt funding raised over the years as a private company. Particularly, Airbnb is said to be targeting an IPO before the year runs out.

Airbnb's S-1 filing shows $4.8 billion in 2019 revenue and a net loss of $674 million in the same year. In the year before that, the company had $3.65 billion in revenue and a net loss of only $16.9 million.

In the first nine months of this year, however, Airbnb saw its revenue go down by a wide margin as the early months of the coronavirus pandemic brought about global travel restrictions that widely affected its business. The company posted $2.5 billion in revenue in the nine months leading up to September, compared to $3.7 billion in the same period of the previous year. The company's losses also more than doubled within that period from $323 million to $697 million.

As of the end of September this year, Airbnb reported having $4.5 billion in available cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. A significant part of that amount comes from the $2 billion in fresh debt and equity funding that the company raised in April this year when the coronavirus pandemic largely affected its business. The funding came from a group of private equity firms including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.

Notably, Airbnb actually turned a profit in its most recent quarter, reporting $219 million in net income on revenues of $1.34 billion. It comes after the company laid off one-quarter of its workforce in May this year.

Airbnb intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ABNB”. The company's public offering is being managed by a party of investment banks including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup, Jefferies, and Allen & Company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
