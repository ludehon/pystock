 Borrowing on Margin (2% APY) for boring Buy and Hold ETF Investing My broker is willing to let me borrow 40% of the funds in my brokerage account at a 2% APY interest rate. They will issue a maintenance call if the account drops 50% but it contains relatively boring ETFs that I plan to hold for 10+ years and therefore I don't envision this happening.

It seems like I should borrow as much as they will give me and reinvest it back into the ETFs as they're expected to return 5-8% per year over the long term. 

Is there something I'm missing? This feels like a no brainer._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The meaning of “over-valued” There is a lot of talk of stocks being “over-valued” without clarification of what this actually means. People forget that valuation is what is being done when people are willing to buy a stock at the price it shows up at. There has been a progressive dissociation between valuation and company worth. If you’re a trader, it doesn’t matter but if you are investing for long term gain this principle is extremely important. If you are a long term investor, simply buying at whatever asking price and pricing far future without checking how that asset is actually doing vs ones that cost the same is asking for a surprise.

This is why I have made the table below. I feel it puts into context what is being discussed for some of the stocks with largest market caps. And gets us thinking about how much “potential” we are actively pricing into some of these assets. There is a reason corrections happen on the market and some can be devastating. 


It is worth thinking about:
1. How much revenue does the company have vs those of a similar or lesser market valuation?

2. How is the rate of revenue increase and actually changing?

3. How much is the profitability vs companies of a similar lesser market cap?

4. Do the current assets hold actual value and how does this value compare with other similarly valued businesses?


At a simpler level:

1. How accessible are the products they physically have available right now? 

2. How many of them do you, your family and your friends have and use currently? 

This explains the growth that some have experienced and some that you might expect given your company choice.


Figuring this out will allow you to figure out how much “potential” investors as a whole are pricing into a company's worth. Furthermore, if a correction occurs on your chosen stock, how much growth will it take to reach those levels again. When corrections occur, the only thing that changes is the market valuation whilst fundamental company metrics stay put and that is why certain stocks never get back to previous valuations i.e. because they were substantially “over-valued” by investors who priced in substantially more potential than they should have. See below.

A lot folks have been posting about investing in ETFs lately. However, nobody is talking about the ETF fees associated with some of these investments. Is this not mentioned because people don’t know about them or think the returns will be greater than the cost of bothering with the fees? Am I missing something? (Newer to investing in ETFs)

For example, ARKG is all the rage but the expense ratio (net) is still .75%. That’s high in comparison to let’s say SPY at 0.09%. 

Can somebody help explain why ARK and let’s say MSOS are so popular but have high expense ratios? Is this a concern?

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/walmart-to-create-fintech-start-up-with-investment-firm-behind-robinhood.html?__source=androidappshare

Walmart has been aggressively expanding in the past couple years.

They're looking to tap into healthcare and finance services and are becoming an in person Amazon, which provides not only every good you'll ever need, but also every in person service.

With their large presence and high volume low cost model, I believe Walmart could really draw upon the pool of underbanked and fintech Americans.

I’ve been interested in bitcoin for a couple of years now but have been reticent to pull the trigger because of price levels. For some reason my investment principles aren’t being applied to bitcoin, but perhaps that is happening to other people as well.

I will say that a part of me wants to just buy the index noted in the title so I don’t have to leave my brokerage. I’m starting to rethink given the APY available in Bitcoin platforms. 

However, for the sake of debate, I’m curious specifically about the pricing differences between the index and bitcoin itself. It’s hard to line up any hard numbers because of the constant fluctuations, but it appears that the index is down significantly more today. Am I wrong about that? If not, what’s the reasoning behind this? Any information is welcome. Thanks exclamation_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question to Investors who have been through the multiple bubbles One of the fundamental reasons why I feel the stock prices are going up is because there are very few places you can park your money:

\- Real estate requires huge capital.

\- Gold and Bitcoin are only a hedge at best. 

So, even though these stock prices are nuts, I can make a case for them to continue to go higher. 

My question to folks who have been through multiple bubbles (including the dot com bubble) is, was it a similar case then too? Was there every few assets where you could park money then too?

1.  If you're invested in a company for the long term, sharing your DD makes it MORE LIKELY for your company to succeed. You get more people to invest in the company you own, the company gets more money to improve their bottom line, (marketing, hiring more engineers, obtaining more money for R&D etc...).  Which then encourages more people to invest in them.  

2. MF has been operating for the past \~30 years. If they really were operating a pump and dump scheme, they would've been ousted long ago.  

3. One of the MF founders interviewed Jack Bogle. During a segment they discussed that the more often you trade or sell stocks, the more likely you are to underperform the market. And they also found that if Warren Buffet never sold a single stock he would've been much wealthier today. Similarly MF found that if they never sold a single stock that they purchased, they also would've performed better. So they stopped adding when to sell stocks on their news letters. 

That's why long term investors like ARK and Motley Fool SHARE all of their research and purchases. When they do that, more people invest in their companies, those companies then have a better chance of getting an early advantage compared to their competitors, and so on.

Disclaimer: I'm not subscribed to Motley Fool, but my dad has for the past 2 years and his portfolio consists entirely of MF stocks. He bought SHOP and FSLY before they were 1/10 the value they are now.

2) E-commerce purchases as a part of all retail in Latin America at the end of last year were somewhere around 4% of the total. Huge growth ahead.
3) MELI jumped 7% on friday because in a press release, MercadoLibre said it will offer $400 million worth of debt paying 2.375% interest and maturing in 2026, and also $700 million worth of debt paying 3.125% and maturing in 2031. The company noted that this will be its first offering of debt securities. 
4) Just started to ride the Green wave, which only brings gains: "MercadoLibre intends to use the net proceeds from the sale ... to finance or refinance ... environmental objectives such as: clean transportation, land conservation and preservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, green buildings and pollution prevention and control."

I'm sure most of you saw that snippet from 60 minutes (posted on WSB recently), saying, "Amazon would have to sell every book being sold in the world today to justify its stock price." That was way back in the late 1990s when Amazon was just an on-line book store. 

Someone else said, "That's Tesla today." 

I'd like to know how. 

Amazon had a clear path to expand from selling books, to household gadgets, to literally everything and anything sold by anyone anywhere. Including things that didn't exist in the 1990s, like AWS cloud services (that \*should\* have gone to someone like Akamai or CSCO or MSFT, or Oracle or even freaking WalMart had a better information system infrastructure than Amazon had in the 1990s.)  Amazon dominating that segment was just a fluke. And currently the lion's share of its revenue too.

Also, I wanted an electric car but didn't want Tesla's goofy iPad-style interface system, among other things, so I took an old sports car and built my own EV. Guess what? EV's are not hard. Sure, mine is definitely not more efficient than a Tesla (or Bolt, or etc.) but I learned something important -- replacing the drivetrain and installing batteries was the easy part (granted, I have some electrical engineering experience -- but not much). Literally everything else about building a car was way, way, WAY harder. Companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc. can \*easily\* outbuild Tesla, and highly efficient, high-torque electric motors and solid state batteries appear to be on their way to commodity status. 

Solar Panels, self-driving capability, yada, yada... I don't see how these can possibly match the scale of what Amazon did. Grid energy storage, merging with Space-X and using Starlink's Skynet as part of the self-driving hive-mind... maybe? 

What else could there be? Fully autonomous, self-managing houses? Is Tesla going to start selling phones that use Starlink, to fulfill the space Iridium tried to back in the 90's?

I've made a few posts here about the different data I collect, so here's another one on the Piotroski Score.

I started tracking the Piotroski Score for >5000 companies last year and dove back in this past week to see how the different scores performed. The answer? Quite well.

**Companies with a Piotroski Score of 9 (10 total) on July 1, 2020, as a basket, returned 56.10%** if held through till market close on Friday. The S&P 500 during the same timeframe returned 22.75%.

There were some super small companies in that batch though including Fuwei Films and Socket Mobile. So I took a look at something a little cleaner, companies scoring 8 or 9 with a market cap > $1B. This, too, beat the market, but by a smaller margin 31.5% versus the 22.75%. It also consisted of 74 stocks, so a little harder to manage if you were to buy them all.

So, is it worth following? Not sure yet, but I use it as a tool to make investment decisions. I like to keep track of it for the companies in my portfolio and watchlists to see that they're improving in this area and not scoring lower and lower over time.

**Companies with a score of 9 today:**

* Avantor Inc

Obviously no one has a crystal ball but what are your stock pick for early January here that you think will rip upwards in 2021.

I'm really looking at $Roku and $FVRR which will continue to grow but I'm simply perplexed with Tesla at the moment and don't understand it's movement other than Fomo at this point

In addition I've been pretty heavy on Arkk and arkw_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When you execute a call and buy the 100 shares, who are you getting the shares from? I know this seems like a pretty generic question but I have never been able to find an answer to my question. My first thought was that the person who sold them the call had to buy 100 shares at the current price and sell them to them at the strike price. But we know that’s not true so who is it, the brokerage? (Edit: Technically this is true sometimes if you buy it from someone writing a call)

Edit: Question answered the original person who wrote the call has to buy and sell (or just sell if it was a covered call)the 100 shares hence selling an uncovered call and selling a covered call. I’m not stupid I mostly understand options. I was confused on whether the liability transfers to you when you bought and sold an option (I was 99% sure they didn’t or else everyone would execute not sell). I was also curious about whether maybe brokerages were usually the ones selling them since they have the big money to cover their calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What's stopping big quant funds like Renaissance Technologies, DE Shaw and Two Sigma from having the future of Long Term Capital Management? As Warren Buffett puts it, LTCM has possibly had the highest concentration of intelligence in a group of 16 people who have worked together in a United States office. A staff made up of the academic and financial elite that ended up bankrupt.

What guarantees that large quantitative funds such as Rennaisence Technologies, DE SHAW, Two Sigma (although this only operates with raw materials) do not have the same future? Especially after the hyperliquidity bubble caused by the FED explodes, which facilitated prediction and reduced market volatility in recent years.

My conclusion is: quantitative strategies are profitable and sustainable only until the size threshold is reached that allows you to take advantage of the instantaneous inefficiencies of the market and an equation will never be invented to solve the market.

Is there a specific legal or technical problem?

Here is the description of medallion fund for anyone who doesn't know:

>*The Medallion fund is considered to be one of the most successful hedge funds ever. It has averaged a 71.8% annual return, before fees, from 1994 through mid-2014. The fund has been closed to outside investors since 1993 and is available only to current and past employees and their families. The firm bought out the last investor in the Medallion fund in 2005 and the investor community has not seen its returns since then. About 100 of Renaissance's 275 or so employees are what it calls "qualified purchasers", meaning they generally have at least $5 million in assets to invest. The remaining are "accredited investors", generally worth at least $1 million. By the year 2000, the computer-driven Medallion fund had made an average of 34% a year after fees since 1988. Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. Between January 1993 and April 2005, Medallion only had 17 monthly losses and out of 49 quarters in the same time period, Medallion only posted three quarterly losses. Between 1989-2005 Medallion had only one year showing a loss: 1989.*

So I hope someone will able to come up with the answer to this question. Hopefully this question wasn't asked in the past._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In this day and age with advanced computers, why does volume spike at all? Logically, wouldn't an algo compensate to buy low over the course of weeks vs paying a premium of 30 40 50 percent on a particular day? I was working on some charts tonight and this logical question popped up. In today's world with advanced computers and algos, why does volume "pop" anymore? Logically, wouldn't I want all my buys to be spread out (as low as possible) over a few days or even weeks? Is this "pop" actually intentional (once a large position is built up) to signal other algos to take notice? This is the only explanation I can think of. Thinking about it, why would a firm pay 20-30-40 percent premium on a single day? It could easily wait and build up a position in my mind_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What happens when you invest in a SPAC? When you buy shares of a SPAC, and then the SPAC merges with a company to ‘Faux-IPO’ it, will the share price adjust such that it is as if you bought what the company would have IPO’d at? For example, if a SPAC IPO’s at $15 but is trading at $30, and they find a company to merge with and the price will be $95, is the financial end-result about the same as the company going the rough the IPO process and pricing/debuting at $95? Will you benefit from the same potential upside (and downside) of day 1 volatility?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) Someone I spoke to recommended adding an MLP, specifically Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) to my portfolio.  I'm just curious about what everyones opinion is about MLPs since it doesn't seem to be discussed often on this sub-forum. 

A few questions I have are: Do you own any MLPS?  Would you recommend MLPs in a portfolio?  Any issues with Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)?  Are K-1 forms really nightmare and do they cause any tax filling issues  (I've heard they're normally mailed late in the tax season)? 

Any feedback will be appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you evaluate management? Just like the header says; what methods do you use to evaluate upper management and their decision making process?

In school, we were taught financial valuation, and innumerable methods thereof.  The older I get though, the more I believe I'm missing an element to my process.  Namely, the human factor.   CEOs are a bit more forward, a quick google search can yield anything I could hope for an more.  But when it comes to other executives and directors I was hoping I could pick the brains of r/investing for your insights._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are the best in-depth books that teach you about mining stocks especially small companies? I would like to learn about mining stocks especially small companies. I have found some books about the subject but none of them have in depth knowledge.

I think we may see people and institutions begin to take profits. This would correlate with the average market low on 3/18/20. If people are holding for 366 days to negate the short term gains taxes, we may be in for a nice correction.. Just a thought. I mean, I am beginning to wonder anything might correct this current environment of stocks only up up mentality?

What do y'all think?'_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Softening the blow of the future crash (my thoughts and guidance request) I'm not sure of how to soften the blow of the impending crash, but here is my current plan.

1. Look over my portfolio and sell the extraordinarily overvalued stocks on the next solid green day (probably after Biden's stimulus speech, assuming that hasn't been priced in).  Already sold TSLA, but I have some mini-TSLA positions that are nearly as absurd.
2. Start investing in gold on every day that gold is in the red.  I'm still debating between gold, gold miners, or gold-related etfs.  But it's looking like GLDM for me.  Any advice here would be useful.
3. Build up a cash reserve (typically, I go for about 7%, but I think I'm going to aim for about 12-15% as there are certainly going to be amazing stock sales coming up).
4. Pump excess cash into fairly valued or undervalued low-volatile/established stocks as, even when they crash, the recovery will be faster (and I can still enjoy some modest gains waiting for the large correction).
5. Save 5% of my portfolio for the wacky, rocket-to-moon rides (enjoy the ride while the ride can be enjoyed).

How does that look as a proactive plan?  What is your plan?  Any adjustments that you would make to this?

I’ve been looking online, but I can’t find a definitive answer—most likely because I’m learning. 

As an example. If a company has 500mm shares OS. They cancel a credit line, returning 100mm shares back to the treasury. Does this action reduce the OS, float or both by 100mm?

I am trying to find a few undervalued funds (even holding companies) in the form of low cost ETFs or mutual funds to park some money over the next year or two. I've been considering energy but I dont know any low cost ETFs. Was also considering Berk.B as I feel is still very undervalued, although it is underperforming the market.

I'm currently 19 and have invested 10.5k into VDHG and 5k in NDQ. I'm thinking of investing 4k in AMZN primarily for their Cloud Services. I've aimed to have a fairly diverse portfolio so I'm wondering if putting so much into a single stock would be dumb given my current portfolio.

Copper is already way up though, and I’m curious what people think in terms of upside from current prices. Is infrastructure investment already priced in? Considering nothing has officially happened yet, I wonder if things could still go way up_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
