 Leverage and Margins I‚Äôm not a trader nor do I intend to be one but a mate of mine recently spoke about how he had a rough trading session I was trying to wrap my head around it, he mentioned about Leverage and Margins, and how it could force him to essentially sell a trade at a loss as opposed to riding out the fall.

Apple would best buy Nissan (and maybe ABB) to accomplish that OK, so lets assume a report that Apple wants to make an iCar in a mere 3 years, by 2024.  A Reuters report says so.

My guess is Apple is going to buy Nissan, or be best served by buying Nissan to achieve that goal. Symbol NSANY.  They make the Nissan Leaf, which is the #1 rated EV according to CarMax. as in

[https://www.carmax.com/articles/best-electric-cars](https://www.carmax.com/articles/best-electric-cars)

The Leaf has been around for years, since 2010.  So the bugs have been worked out.  Apple would only want to acquire a company with a car with quality suitable to their Apple brand image.

If you are not a car company you are not going to make a car from scratch by 2024.  You have to make an  acquisition.  Nissan stock is dirt cheap, an easy purchase for Apple.  Nissan's market cap is in Yen, so given the current exchange rate

0.0097 x 2.459bil\_yen = $23.9 billion in USD -->  would be needed to buy Nissan.

Apple has $192 bil in cash.

Tesla is clearly too expensive a company to purchase.

Tesla's achilles heal is it has no dealerships.  Nissan does.  Apple has the Apple store, so there is no evidence to suggest that they would be averse to having an in person sales channel.

Or spin the wheel of fortune to determine which car company Apple will buy in early 2021.  This one is my opinion.

If Apple also wants to eat up the business of equipment that charges EVs (similar to a gas station but with electricity as many of you know), ABB makes the power electronics guts that goes into the EVgo service.  Perhaps Apple would buy them too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top stocks holding 2020 Tesla is now officially in the S&P500.  Not only is it in the S&P it is a top 10 holding of the index.

I‚Äôm a 22m filmtrepeneur from Baton Rouge. 
I have a production company that myself and a few friends from high school started once we graduated that‚Äôs been doing pretty well and gaining a good reputation among our community. 
Even still, the business is very contract dependent. The recent boom of mobile trading caught up to me like many throughout the quarantine, and the concept of using stocks as a sort of passive income while my business grows is very appealing. 

I started by riding whatever stocks my friends and redditors were talking about, and learned quickly that I‚Äôm not made for day trading penny stocks. I would watch stocks go up up up and then drop as soon as I bought a share! I tried that for a while, only hooked by the times I‚Äôd see my money rise for a while before kicking my hind again. Eventually I decided that I‚Äôm not any smarter than the real investors out there, and that I should just invest in ETF‚Äôs. My friend introduced me to option trading, and I must admit, I took TOO MUCH of his advice, and sunk my portfolio again into penny stock options. DARN!

So I‚Äôve retreated back to ETF‚Äôs. ETF Managers are better than I at this and I fully surrender to that! This time though, I‚Äôm confident to reach beyond just buying the stocks and I‚Äôve bought a few options on ETF‚Äôs.
Today marked my largest growth yet, as my portfolio rose 11%! 

I‚Äôve taken a lot of hard falls while trying to ride the trends of pennys and other day-trading techniques, and today I‚Äôm fully confident that it takes some cuts and bruises to learn anything. I hope to continue learning my strengths, and to prosper in my own lane. 

I hope to hear if anyone else has experienced this for themselves, or if they have a totally DIFFERENT experience!

Dec. 21, 2020 10:42 AMfuboTV Inc. (FUBO)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor

FuboTV (FUBO +17.0%) breaks higher after Axios says the company is looking at forming exclusive sports content deals.
CEO David Gandler is quoted by Axios as saying it is not unreasonable for FuboTv to consider exclusive options with sports leagues._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When researching a stock, how and what do you do? When doing research on a stock you‚Äôre looking at, what are your ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù sources? Do you head straight to charts, reports, etc.? How long does it take you to get a comfortable feel for the stock? Where/how do you store information of the stock?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are my PUTS worthless now? (Need advice) I am fairly new to options (few months of experience) so basically, I bought few puts for $RP for $65 a few days ago, and now Thomas Bravo plans to take $RP private for $10.2B, Shares jumped from $67 to $90 overnight.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/realpage-deal-12-things-for-rp-stock-investors-to-know-about-the-thomas-bravo-news/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/realpage-deal-12-things-for-rp-stock-investors-to-know-about-the-thomas-bravo-news/)

Thomas Bravo plans will have it paying a total of $88.75 in cash to shareholders for each share of $RP stock that they own.

So in this case are my puts completely worthless? What will happen to stock price will it always stay above $88.75 since this is the price they are offering to pay? Is there any chance my puts are worth anything or will be worth anything in the next month? They were expiring 2 months from now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ KOPN is a momentum play.  

Last week, I posted a recommendation to buy short term calls on VUZI(AR glasses company). Since then, the stock has run over 100%(?!?). Crazy, I didn't even expect that.

The next play would be KOPN. KOPN is a display manufacturer that is a supplier for VUZI. That's currently running up, and I'm not sure how long this one will last. If you are risk neutral to loving in your trading, consider buying calls to ride the wave(maybe stocks would be better for this one).

Hey reddit, stock noobie here looking for some clarification. So I recently invested in Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), not knowing the difference between BEP and BEP-C, and read on their website about how BEP requires us to fill out the K-1 Form for tax purposes on an annual basis. I have never done this in my life and was wondering if this is for the dividends that we receive which are taxable, or if it is the actual price of the stock as well?

For example, if I bought 100 shares for $40 at $4,000 and by the end of the year the stock is $45, do I have to pay that income tax of $500 and report it on my K-1 form? And then do that every year going forth, or is it strictly based on dividends?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I don't understand the ARK funds alignment. I am interested in buying into these funds but am having trouble with their alignment. I see a lot of the same stocks are in multiple funds but also some that don't seem to fit the description.

When looking at ARQ for example i see they hold positions in the following.

I think I had the final straw from WF brokerage. Its a rather convenient system with free trading, but there has been some serious ‚Äúglitches‚Äù that have cost me money. For example, I had stocks that I couldn‚Äôt sell after a split, their system glitched the stock and had to be fixed over the phone. More recently, I had a limit sell order automatically cancel on me....literally was being used as a safety cushion that didn‚Äôt work! The stock was in the sell limit too, prior to losing $700 more after having to sell manually over the phone. Everytime I sell I have to wait 4 days for funds to be available and theres no way to track this (i.e. it still is shown as available funds). If you use it too early, 90-day freeze. I‚Äôm not really an active trader (buy and hold usually) so it has worked for me so far, but was really wondering if theres better out there. I have yet to do much research on other brokerage options, so just wanted to ask you all if you have any advice.

I really like having commission free trades and easy access to transferring money into the brokerage from my checking. Are those options not available for <$30,000 users in the other brokerages?

Thanks for any tips!

I'm very new to all of this so I've probably made a mistake somewhere along the way but here's my situation: I bought a few shares of a stock that has been booming the last few months. This is great, except I've lost like 15 bucks on it even though it's now worth more than what I bought it for??

[12-21] **The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).

We saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).

Here is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.

For the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.

We also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.

While the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.

We also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.

So, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.

We also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.

We also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.

In some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.

We also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED‚Äôs second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.

Let‚Äôs hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn‚Äôt worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn‚Äôt affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer & Moderna.

Maybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. 

My belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don‚Äôt think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.

- FED printed $ for handing out to jobless wankers. They are likely to spend it on PS5 and gaming accessories such as headsets
- lockdowns starting in Europe so more wankers are gonna stay home and play games

(NASDAQ:TSLA) will make up for 1.69% of the S&P 500 index as it makes its debut on Monday‚Äôs open, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.

What Happened: Silverblatt said S&P 500‚Äôs price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.

S&P 500‚Äôs dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.

Why It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).

Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A and Class C shares have 1.66% and 1.61% weighting, respectively.

Goldman Sachs analysts last week said Tesla‚Äôs addition to S&P 500 will not make the index more expensive, noting that the aggregate index P/E multiple of S&P 500 will be lifted by slightly less than 1.5% on the EV maker‚Äôs inclusion.

What Happened:¬†The latest tranche of the relief package includes $15 billion in aid for the airline industry as reimbursement to reinstate payrolls.

The $15 billion aid comes with similar restrictions as¬†the previous aid that expired in October.¬†Reportedly, airline carriers will attempt to bring workers back but the period without the aid has made it difficult, according to the Airlines for America trade group.

As many as 32,000 airline workers were furloughed after the last round of stimulus expired. As per¬†an earlier report, many employees took a pay cut and expected the new relief bill to cover airline salaries through March 2021.

Why It Matters:¬†The pandemic has severely dented the airlines. Over the last seven days, airlines passenger traffic was roughly 35% compared to last year, as per Bloomberg. According to TSA data, it is the lowest year-over-year comparison since September.

Airlines are losing money due to a steep drop in travel. Though lawmakers from both parties have called for more aviation support, congressional leaders have not agreed on the provisions for a broader relief bill.

Apart from the $15 billion payroll aid, the bill also includes $1 billion for airline contractor payrolls, $10 billion for state highways, $2 billion for airports and airport concessionaires, $2 billion for the private motor coach, school bus, and ferry industries, and $1 billion for Amtrak, Bloomberg reports.

The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Monday followed by the Senate, as per Reuters.¬†Outgoing President Donald Trump has expressed his support and will sign the bill into law, a White House spokesperson said._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on SPYG?

I am recently new to trading, so i'm a bit of a rookie in the game. I've come up with some general ideas of what industries could posinly boom after the pandemic ends and the economy recovers. I'd like to become a generally more long-term stock investor, not a penny trader or day trader. But i'd like to hear any opinions or criticisms on my ideas:

Tourism. I know that investing in tourism is a generally risky industry. Airline and cruise holdings plummeted when lockdown was put into effect and the pandemic really spread. Royal Carribbean stock plummeted 30 dollars, and airlines crashed. However, is it a good idea to buy now when they're cheap and down, and after pandemic, when demand for visiting, vacations, and business trips increases due to a prolonged amount of time of that being unavailable, the stock goes up, and i've made a profit. 

Pharmaceuticals. I've already put some money into pfizer and Biontech shares. There's been discussion amongst online news journals discussing whether Biontech and Pfizer stock is a buy. A vaccine is obviously gonna be in demand. But, to my knowledge, most countries are going to buy the vaccine with federal funds. So, is this going to improve stock? If so, it might be a good idea to invest in Moderna as well. I'd like to hear thoughts on this one.

As a new stock trader, are there any industries that will boom after quarantine? There's certainly gonna be a resurgence in the economy, or at the very least, a general growth after the pandemic is resolved. So i'm wondering if any stock might see a rapid growth due to being unavailable in quarantine. Also, please provide me some tips about trading, i'm a young a fresh dude who's interested in it. Thank you for your replies!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I could use a bit of portfolio advice. Currently, ARKF holds about 15% of my portfolio. The rest is split between VOO/VIG/VGT. Now, I like ARKF and I really do believe in Fintech, specifically Square, PayPal, etc. However, is 15% too much to allocate towards an ETF that‚Äôs a bit more risky than VOO/VTI? I also don‚Äôt like having an ETF that doesn‚Äôt pay dividends.

Yes, I'm young and yes the money are low, but I want to try. If you have no will to help yet another "100$ guy" just quit the thread. I don't need more "stop investing and start saving" comments.

Hi. Backstory - I'm 20 yr old student from europe. I started my adventure with stocks 2x nov, so I'm a newbie here. Bought a single CDPR share back then (wish I bought more) and sold 7 dec, earning 20$. I know it's pennies, but I'm proud of myself because I'm newbie and my whole portfolio is like 350$. People on this sub told me that I shouldn't do it as CP77 was already priced in, but I decided to buy it anyway. I was right (newbie's luck I guess).

I want to invest more and make the 350$ into some bigger numbers. My monthly savings are like 50$, because as I mentioned, I'm young student living on my own and that's all I can afford.

I heard that PLTR is probably going to skyrocket in next few years. So here is my question. Should I invest the whole 350$ + future savings and wait until it hits the moon? Or go more into short term/day trading?

Right now I bought 2 People Can Fly shares (20$ each) as they have just entered the market and predictions are they will rise +30% in february. Probably gonna buy more if it gets cheaper. Maybe it's most stupid thing I could do, but I have 0 knowledge and money is low, so I'm willing to take the risk.

If it's good idea to invest into PLTR, what are best european brokers? I heard degiro is decent.

You can view the original Post here [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kcn9iz/weekly_update_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/)

Just to recap the data collected for the analysis was collected from 12/6 ‚Äì 12/12.  We scraped comments and posts on reddit that mentioned stock contracts that expired Friday 12/18. The goal of the project is to see how reddit preforms picking contracts‚Ä¶ Is reddit right or wrong.  

My hypothesis is that for the most part reddit will be wrong.  So, selling the most popular contracts will be a profitable investment.  Just to be clear this is a hypothesis and not something I actually traded.  The idea here is that if I start the week selling the most popular contracts, I will end the week profitable.  

In my previous post I said I would sell the 630 TSLA 12/18 Calls,  32 PLTR 12/18 Calls, LAZR 25 12/18 PUTS, LAZR 20 12/18 PUTS Monday morning.  Below are the options and the Premium Gained as of Monday Morning: 

* TSLA 630 $3710
* PLTR 32 $40

* LAZR 25 $130
* LAZR 20 $ 20

TSLA was a big loser this week as the massive pump in the last few minutes of trading.  I have been unable to identify the exact price that TSLA options executed on Friday, but according to Tradingview TSLA closed the week at $695 (if anyone knows what price TSLA options executed at on Friday's close, please let me know.). With a Closing price of $695 that would have netted a loss of $2,800.  The PLTR and LAZR plays would have closed 100% worthless, bringing week two's total to -2,610$.

Week 1: +$1710
Week 2: -$2610 

Additional Data:

(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said on Sunday it has agreed to buy U.S. rocket engine manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc for $4.4 billion, including debt and net cash.

The deal is Lockheed‚Äôs biggest acquisition since Jim Taiclet took over as chief executive in June. He is seeking to beef up the company‚Äôs propulsion capabilities amid competition from new entrants such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, for space contracts with the U.S. government.

‚ÄúAcquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne will preserve and strengthen an essential component of the domestic defense industrial base and reduce costs for our customers and the American taxpayer,‚Äù Taiclet said in a statement.

‚ÄúAs part of Lockheed Martin, we will bring our advanced technologies together with their substantial expertise and resources to accelerate our shared purpose: enabling the defense of our nation and space exploration,‚Äù Aerojet‚Äôs CEO Eileen Drake said in a statement.

Lockheed said it will pay $56 per share for Aerojet Rocketdyne, a 33 percent premium to Friday‚Äôs closing price. The purchase price will be reduced to $51 per share after the payment of a pre-closing special dividend, Lockheed added.

The Bethesda, Maryland-based company already uses Aerojet Rocketdyne‚Äôs propulsion systems in its aeronautics, missiles and fire control offerings.

Lockheed said the transaction, which is set to be scrutinized by regulators given the company‚Äôs leading position in the defense sector, is expected to close in the second half of 2021.

Taiclet took the top job at Lockheed in June and closed here on a deal to buy Integration Innovation Inc., a Huntsville, Alabama-based hypersonic weapon software and systems maker, by November.

I  currently make around 130k, and income in my field typically goes up  exponentially with experience though COVID-19 seems to be causing  dramatic shifts for the worse in the field. I should be able to get  250k-300k once I am experienced in industry though.

I first focused entirely on increasing savings enough for a cushion, but have now started to look at investing (as of Dec 1st). My portfolio is as follows:

\~19k in RSUs of company I work for (don't want to mention name, but it was one the largest growth stocks in the S&P 500 this week)

4k in AAPL

1k PLTR

5k in AMZN

10.5k in VFIAX (S&P 500)

340 in FXIAX (S&P 500 - 401k employer match)

I  plan on keeping all investments long term. Current plans for investing  are 500/week into VFIAX and maximize employer match into 401k which comes to around 700/month (will go into FXIAX). I do not plan on adding additional single company investments at this time. This brings total investments per month to about 2700 USD, about 36% of post tax income. My friends and family have told me I am being way too  aggressive with stocks and say that the market is too volatile right now  and we should expect the market to crash in the next year or two.

The market and most growth/blue chip tickers were very mixed in performance last week.

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week and my buying power currently sitting at about half my account. Tickers with positions still open: **CODX, FROG, NIO, PLTR, TDOC, U, WKHS**. Most are sitting at 40% profit already and I'll be looking to close around 60-70% if we get a good pop. Let's see.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my "watchlist". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**OSTK ($62)**

[OSTK - chart](https://imgur.com/Po9EXD0)

I'm going to bring OSTK back this week after the red day it had on Friday. It's still near the lower end of the channel (consolidating) and I can see this getting a bounce back into the $70 zone. Support will be in the $57-58 zone if it continues to drop further.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $55 put for $3.25 or $325 premium. Return: 6%

2. Buy the dip on some shares and take some off the table as it gets close to $70.

&#x200B;

**PLTR ($26)**

[PLTR chart](https://imgur.com/bLj6zOo)

Implied Volatility on PLTR has been giving absolutely juicy premiums, however, it seems like it's starting to go down after its been in the $25 range the last several weeks. I'd like to see this stay above $25 next week and then potentially break-out back above $30. It's currently at the bottom of the channel, if it breaks maybe we'll see back down to $22 support. I like this ticker and will be buying the dip when I can or if I get assigned.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $24 put for $1.75 or $175 premium. Return: 7.3%

2. Shares are also good here, but I prefer to collect on the high IV while I still can.

&#x200B;

**SPCE ($24)**

[SPCE - chart](https://imgur.com/rXuPjHe)

SPCE had to re-schedule their launch last week and the stock price seemed to be relying on a successful trip. It's had some pretty big gap downs last week and is sitting at -30% in the last 7 days. With the volatility the stock has experienced, the trend is difficult to identify. However, I think $22 level will provide good support and some buyers. If not we may re-visit $18 again like it did back in November. I'll be testing my luck on this one selling some puts.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $22 put for $1.37 or $137 premium. Return: 6.2%

2. Shares might be a good entry looking for a bounce play. Like I said, the positions I am entering will be expecting the stock to stay above $22 and perhaps get back into the $25 range.

&#x200B;

**PSTH ($25)**

[PSTH - chart](https://imgur.com/8s6Ok0s)

PSTH had a good run-up recently. Many investors are expecting some big news coming from Bill Ackman. Many rumors floating around for different acquisitions, but nobody really knows what's happening. In my opinion as more time goes by then we will be getting closer to a merger. With more exposure the stock has been getting I think the speculation on which acquisition alone will keep the stock above $25. Implied Volatility also not bad here. I'm going to sell an ATM put on this one. Risk level is a little higher, but any early assignment would actually do me a favor and make my trade more profitable.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 6%. Break-even stock price here is $23.50, so I only need the stock to stay above that in 4 weeks.

2. Might also pick up some shares if the stock dips some more.

&#x200B;

**BIG ($45)**

[BIG - chart](https://imgur.com/nr9F2De)

This name is somewhat unusual and isn't mentioned very much. I've been keeping my eye on it and look at this consolidation it's had over the last 3-4 months. It's been within a 10% range the entire time, kind of cool to see. It's had a big gap down and a massive red candle Friday. I want to see some of the price action Monday or Tuesday, but in my opinion, the $43-44 level could provide a good bounce.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $42.50 put for $1.85 or $185 premium. Return: 4.5%. Break-even stock price is $40.65 here.

2. IV is fairly moderate here and selling puts wouldn't be the most efficient. I might buy some shares instead and look to start taking profits at the $50 level._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Volume Importance I do understand that stock volume is very important for liquidity. What volume is considered good/bad? For example, I'm in love with IHI ETF, it's for medical devices. The average volume is about 150K. Is this an issue at all?

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic‚Äôs shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
