thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BBBY Short squeeze plan Here is my take on $BBBY 6 days before their Q3 ER.

After a big change in management now led by Mark Tritton, $BBBY has managed to crawl back from the dead by shutting down numerous stores, selling the Cost Plus World Market and significantly improving the online shopping, which has played a large part in BBBY's success story.  All the company's debt has now been paid off and they have announced a large share buyback plan.

$BBBY managed to beat their Q2 estimate by $0,73 which resulted in $BBBY skyrocketing 70%. After that the stock has fallen 33% and has at the moment over 60% short float. 

All aforementioned information means that a large üåàüêª trap has been set and we are going to see a massive short-squeeze. Q3 earnings are supposed to be positive and are going to function as a catalyst to brutalize the bears. Combining it with the January effect, $BBBY has set its course to the Moon and the engines have been fired up.

Possible risks:
-$BBBY fell through its support line at $18 per share. There is a large gap to fill and although unlikely, the fall to $15 is not impossible.
-According to Yahhoo Finance $BBBY has formed a bearish Top Triangle pattern. A bullish Falling Wedge pattern has also taken form in 1 day chart but in my opinion patterns won't play a large role in this short-squeeze.
-Average analyst rating is 2,6. Who really cares tho.

TLDR:
-Possible short-squeeze incoming
-60% short float
-Q3 ER in 6 days, likely to beat the estimated earnings
-$BBBY has fallen almost 20% during December, great time to buy.
-Buy shares not options.

January 9: GME releases December sales numbers.

* **How did get tied up with QS?**
   * The VW CEO Martin Winterkorn son (also named Martin) works/worked for one of the QS Founder (Prof Prinz) at Stanford.

   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/)
   * CEO Winterkorn resigned from VW (Dielgate) in  2015, but VW completed their first investment in QS in 2014 (and had a 'relationship' with QS since 2012 (according to the recent QS presentation))
* **Guess**: VW "diesel-gate" caused VW to bet bigger on clean-tech like QS, since they were already down the plan.

&#x200B;

**Tech**

* **Prototype cell**:  Single-layer and 30 x 30 mm (1.1811 inch x 1.1811 inch)
   * The small size, which is quite far away from a commercial size cell makes be doubt if the results will scale to commercial size cells.

&#x200B;

* **Lack of Energy Density Data**:  This is usually measured in Watt-hour/weight or Watt-hour/volume (Wh/kg or Wh/L).  QS shows a graph with their energy density at 1,000 Wh/L, but it wasn't backed up with any data, so it just looked like a goal.
   * Another point is that, when you have a 'solid' battery like QS, with no liquid electrolyte, you need  some additional materials to create the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (an anolyte and catholyte). No liquid electrolyte is good, since it reduces the "explosivity" of the battery.  But some in the industry think that, the need for an anolyte and catholyte, will cause the battery to have a lower energy density, and therefore not make economical sense.

&#x200B;

* **Solid State Separator (SSS**):  QS's main technical achievement is in the SSS, which separates the anode from the cathode.  Why hasn't anyone developed a good SSS yet?
   * **Perfect surface:**  The SSS needs to have perfect surface qualities.  If not, dendrites grow, and end up breaking through the SSS, and shorting out the anode and cathode (think of sticking a 2-prong fork into your electric outlet).
      * **Manufacturing Costs**: To create these perfect surfaces, requires technology more similar to semiconductor manufacturing than battery manufacturing equipment.  Semicon equipment is very expensive and doesn't have high-throughput (yes, when you're selling a < 0.5" square chip for $100+, it makes sense, but when you scale up to battery sizes, it doesn't make economical sense).
      * **Thin**: In order to keep energy density high the SSS needs to be thin, but the thinner it gets, the less strong it is.
      * **Fragile**: These thin and perfect SSS's are somewhat fragile, so in order to not degrade over the 100k mile life in a car, the battery pack needs to have more cushioning and other structures to make sure the SSS doesn't crack.
      * **High Temperatures**:  SSS's conduct electricity best when they are warm 30C+.  This is why the main QS results are done at 30C and 45C.  Yes, QS shows some data at lower temperatures, but if QS's SSS worked well at lower temps, why weren't all the results shown at room temp (20F or 68F)?
      * Also needing equipment to warm up your batteries, takes up more battery-pack volume, therefore decreases the energy-density, and increase cost and complexity.

Look over the list of stocks that have more than tripled in 2020 and GameStop has to jump out at you. GameStop? Really. The small-box video game retailer is one of this year's biggest winners despite wrapping up what will be its third consecutive fiscal year of declining sales. We're not buying physical games these days, and that's bad news for a model that relies on folks trading in their used games and gear for in-store credit.

We're kicking off a new console cycle, but hardware is always the lowest-margin business here. Once you score your PS5 you're not going to come back to GameStop for games the way you did in the past. GameStop used to be a cash-generating machine, but it's been three years since it turned an annual profit. The once beefy dividend was nixed two years ago.

A short squeeze has propped the stock higher, and the market's underestimating what a new console cycle will mean for GameStop. This game was over before it even started, and GameStop -- like DoorDash and SeaWorld -- will be a silent wealth killer in 2021.

Individuals who are looking to to enter and exit a trade on the same day (day trade) more than 3 times a week are restricted in doing so by the Pattern Day-Trade Rule or, ‚ÄúPDT‚Äù. There are important exceptions to this rule that new investors should understand and consider.

1. Does not apply to cash accounts
2. Does not apply to accounts LARGER than 25k
3. For every one account you open you get 3 day trades a week.

Assuming most of us don‚Äôt have $25,000 to put into an investing account right away and opening multiple accounts can over complicate your investing, we are going to go with **opening a cash account.**

A cash account in investing is a direct/non-credit account. This means you will receive no margin/funds from your [broker](https://tdameritrade.com/) to invest with on top of your initial cash balance. **There is no day trading limit on cash accounts**, keep in mind though this also means you will have to wait for your money to clear which usually takes 2-3 days from the closing date of a stock position. **Good news for options traders!** Funds from your daily option buying and selling are available the next day for you to trade with, without the PDT rule. Funds recieved from closing option contracts take less time to clear than funds recived from closing stock positions.

Many traders will allocate the amount of money they will use to buy and sell options. For new traders, lets say I have $1000, I am going to put $800 in long term positions and use $200 to trade options. If I buy an AMD contact for $180, even if I sell that AMD contract right after buying it, that $180 won‚Äôt be available for me to use again until it has cleared the following morning. This is one of the many reasons why it is important for small account holders to plan their trades, ensuring they will have funds available to them for their planned entrances.

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. 

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an "Expected Value" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

This could have been 407.1 shares of GME or 325.7 shares of Pltr at current prices.

Edit-updated to dollars from euros for the simpletons

I'm glad I was part of this special moment.

Congratulations retards, this is de way üöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fulfilling my Ryan Gosling Big Short fantasy by throwing my life savings into DoorDash puts DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO so that confirms that this isn't gonna do something retarded and pull a STONKS ONLY GO UP move. People can see that its worth dogshit. Only \~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.

Here's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at an average of $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade in the beginning of March. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.

Now considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.

Fundamentally, DoorDash is also doorTrash. While it does command 50% of the food delivery market, it made a measly $1.9B revenue through September 2020 with $149M in losses ([DoorDash releases S-1 for IPO, reports $149M in losses through September (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/doordash-releases-s-1-for-ipo.html)) during COVID lockdowns across the nation, when it is literally the best possible conditions for food delivery. As vaccinations and anti-maskers start going out again, revenue will only decrease. There is also no brand loyalty, and no advantage over its competitors such as UberEats, Postmates, Grubhub, Waitr, Seamless, Munchery, Instacart, the pizza delivery guy fucking your wife, etc.

I have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.

Looking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded. Also would really like a Bubble Boy flair.

Edit: Since some of ya'll reminded me of how irrational the market is, I might roll out my puts to Jan 22 leaps depending on what happens next week. Thanks for the feedback, love this community_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GameStop Short Squeeze (The Movie) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just unbanned for GME DD. Next up TWTR DD for 2021. I am writing this Twitter DD on 12/28/20 while currently banned for posting a rumor that I made up that Gamestop would be delivering vaccines.   

Onto the Twitter DD.  

Point 1: Look at TWTR just by the numbers. The market cap is $43B as compared to Snap at $73B. Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 187 million daily actives. Snap has something like 101 million daily active users. Snap has 1.72B in revenue in 2019. Twitter had 3.5B in revenue in 2019. The maths dont add up.   

More recently, Q3 2020 was $775M for Twitter and $679M, Q3 2020.  Snap is growing faster so the higher multiple may be justified from that perspective. But what if Twitter came up with a new revenue stream? If you are still reading, might as well read a little more. It's not like I am going to start a rumor that Gamestop is going to deliver the coronavirus vaccine despite this map showing how easily half the United States could both get coronavirus-free and a new PS5 while waiting https://bit.ly/2WSQvq8. I digress...

Point 2: Twitter announced in July that they are going to work on a paid version ala OnlyFans (https://cnn.it/34L1VRl). If they actually introduce that this year, this should be a similar moment to Disney killing it on digital subscribers (which I made 1000% and $100k on https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqytzu/mickey_mouse_mega_gains_mickey_mousa_usa_usa_1500/) or Facebook adding local stores or whatever they did this year. The question is WHEN will Twitter introduce it. If you are hiring in July would you beta something 6 months out? 9 months out? 12 months? That's for your call options to decide.   

Point 3: Twitter has the worst career pages of all tech companies. But if you are willing to suffer through the shitty animations, the worst search you have ever used, and forced diversity showcasing imagery, then you might notice that recent Engineering posts like the one in this screenshot https://imgur.com/a/D85SNsM (post here: https://bit.ly/37QZnD3) hold a curious couple lines around payments. Specifically:  "We‚Äôre on a mission to build the foundation of a strong payment platform to enable a multi-fold growth of Twitter‚Äôs revenue." and "Enable payments functionality for advertisers, and in ****not-so-distant future****, for other Twitter revenue streams."   
   
Now again, it's up to you to decide what "not-so-distant" means. To me, that means 1-2 quarters maximum. To a shitty company, that could mean 1-2 years or it might never happen. My opinion is that now that Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter employees can "work from home forever" they might actually be motivated to build some shit that makes more money. To prove that this may actually be the case, check out Glassdoor reviews. You will notice that those from engineers have become more positive with 5 star reviews https://bit.ly/2X44h9P.   
   
tl;dr Twitter might be your chance to invest in something like OnlyFans before OnlyFans IPOs or gets acquired by a SPAC or whatever

Palantir:

 'A ***palant√≠r*** ([/Ààp√¶l…ônÀåt…™…ôr/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); *pl.* ***palant√≠ri***) is a fictional magical [artefact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(fantasy)) from [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palant√≠r* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\[T 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?

Mithril:

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, "beauty and terror \[were\] side by side".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil "inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth",[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: "Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. 

Does Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?

As we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?

Does that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  üöÄ ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan Happy new year WSB, here's my perspective on how to trade TSLA in 2021

**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

>Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

>Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

>Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for "all other things being equal"), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

I wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citron was wrong about NIO. Tesla Model Y in China is priced higher ($52 k) than rumored ($49 k). Government subsidies only apply to EV that cost less than 300,000 yuan ($45,920) so the model Y doesn‚Äôt qualify.  

However, since NIO has swapping stations, NIO qualifies for $2-3k in subsidies.  The starting price for NIO is $56 k before subsidies (or $46 k if they decide to lease the battery).

https://cntechpost.com/2021/01/01/china-made-tesla-model-y-goes-on-sale-price-from-about-52000/

Update:  

Analysts predicted the price for the Model Y could be as low as $41 k:

‚ÄúLeft argues NIO is vulnerable to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y pricing in China. Where analysts thought a price tag of $56,000 to $73,000 for the Model Y would be problematic for NIO's ES6 hatchback, analysts now believe Tesla could price it as low as $41,000, which hammers even harder at NIO's valuation relative to its rival.‚Äù

One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just "cloud" and "software" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd](https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd)

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20](https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20)

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability.

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better.

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

Edit: Just take a look a the reviews for salesforce [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP.

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then the stock could be in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be late February/early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&#x200B;

tldr; buy puts for late February/early March

Both these movements suggest a potential stronger movement in the coming week.

Just an idea after looking at Best Of's in other subreddits._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME with Greeks for the Geeks ETHOS: I've been scalping stocks for four years. From the start, I've planned on making a living from it. YTD I've finished 2020 at 230%. (Only played tesla once and lost on it.) This is my career path and my rent, car, bills, wife, and step child all depend on it.

PATHOS: fuck banks. Fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck them. Anybody who's tried to swim in the market knows that big money controls money. WSB has caught two such banks with their shorts down. Melvin and BOA have their shorts around their ankles on GME. 

LOGOS: The market is not a gentle place. And what's right does not always prevail. My 12/31 16.50 calls turned to equity today and now I hold $20k+ in GME. I'm right, GME gang is right, the people are right and the banks are wrong. 

I'm in this trade because I'm waiting for a squeeze. I don't think the banks are even sweating yet. My $20k and WSB's $20 million aren't enough.

due to the cares act pasting earlier in 2020 you are able to take forbearance and not have to pay back the missed payments until the end of your loan. 

Think about it, you basically get an interest free loan for 30 God damn years.

Example: My mortgage is $1300 now even if you were a boring ass boomer excited about your 7% annual returns after 30 years you would accumulate $118,751 after the 30 years.

Now if you want to showcase how massive your giant bull balls are you can put that money in PLTR, GME, or TSLA and see real fucking gains.

Notable positions:

Jan: Mostly Tesla and SPCE FDs

Feb/Mar: Cashed out on my FDs and became bicurious, lots of SPY and CCL puts

Apr: Doubled down on puts, became too gay and ended up fucking myself like the rest of the stupid üåàüêªs. Learned to never fight the printer ever gain.

May/June: Random plays from different companies, stayed flat between gains and losses

July: Fucked by PCG, my first of many purchases of a certain a penny stock (banned in here since it's apparently a pump and dump, but its a psychedelic company that I bought after watching a video with Mr. Wonderful and the CEO of the company)

August: CHGG calls, made some gains and doubled down, but ended up losing some in September, bought more of my penny stock

September: üåàüêª again, SPY FDs, penny stock purchase

October: My penny stock begins to print bigly, sold off my gains to prepare for the PLTR üöÄ at the end of the month

November: PLTRüöÄ takes flight, sold all any remaining positions that wasn't PLTR and bought PLTR FDs lol. Got off the flight just before the month ended

December: Secured my tendies, paid off my motorcycle (2020 YZ250X) Hopped back into my penny stock again just in time before it really printed, but I won't be selling those shares any time soon.  Bought into MT and hoping that this steel üöÄtakes off next year.

A lot of you tards theorized that the price could start going up in Jan because of this but remember, the shorts are watching us

Remember this every time you read any post or comment about GME on this sub

_____________________________________________

We already know you fucks are paper hands and that a ton of you guys sold after Q3 er in Dec since people genuinely thought the squeeze might happen then but the share price dropped

I predict the shorts might continue dropping the price throughout January because sentiment is so high for that time and cause more people to sell

I'm telling you to fucking hold because we will get those tendies

_____________________________________________

Now why am I telling you to roll out Jan and Apr calls? Because you guys are still too fucking jumpy on the squeeze date and squeeze duration

Listen the Volkswagen infinity squeeze lasted less than a week because Porsche owned a ridiculous amount of shares by themselves so the price violently went up until Porsche decided to sell

Since GME ownership is spread so thin, people will be selling off at 30, 40, 50, etc at various points up to ~180 (my peak price target). This means shorts will be able to cover slowly one at a time but also that the squeeze will happen over a period of 3-6 MONTHS like Overstock and Tesla in 2013

If you have Jan or Apr calls, you will almost certainly miss the peak of the squeeze if it even happens before then (unlikely imo)

_____________________________________________

I HIGHLY suggest selling calls soon and BUYING SHARES to üíé‚úãat least another full year

or rolling out your calls to Jan 2022 expiry whatever strike you want because ideally, you want a buffer of 45 days + 3-6 months between the start of the squeeze and expiry, in order to capture the entire squeeze and not have theta decay eat into your gains

Jan 2022 expiry means you're hoping the catalyst to squeeze is icr conference (Jan), holidays sales report (Jan) (both unlikely imo), Q4 er (March), Board vote (June), Q1 ER (June/July) and Q2 er (Sept/Oct)

Playing Jan or Apr means you're only betting on a few events triggering the squeeze and you won't even get the full thing

_____________________________________________

It's important to remember that even though Ryan Cohen is able to turn GME around, making software and transforming the company into a digital focused one takes a lot of time especially if the GameStop coders are really bad (which they are, Silicon Valley engineers are many, many magnitudes smarter and faster than typical non tech corporation ones, I've been a software engineer at both types of companies)

Since the transformation will take a long time, the fruits of Cohen labour would only be apparent in a much later er so I HIGHLY recommend shares and just liquidating any calls with < 2022 expiry

The best ‚Äúnews‚Äù can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they‚Äôll use someone effective. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#DD points: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as ‚Äúessential business‚Äù was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to ‚Äútechnology‚Äù category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that they‚Äôll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with ‚Äúabout 6‚Äù vendors and providers ‚Äúa couple which were just recently.‚Äù That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They‚Äôve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let‚Äôs be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you‚Äôre not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You‚Äôre helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn‚Äôt to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You‚Äôve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 3 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn‚Äôt taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isn‚Äôt going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells ‚Äúused games‚Äù for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don‚Äôt make this decision, they sign contracts that can‚Äôt reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business after customer service is to have profit margins.

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you‚Äôre on...

Let‚Äôs talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that‚Äôs part of why you get offered low prices.

There‚Äôs other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, it‚Äôs not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There‚Äôs much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There‚Äôs pros and cons to everything. I‚Äôm not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 


#TL;DR:

ICR changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. They‚Äôve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.

Ok so this is bugging me the fuck out. basically this is the 1/15 GME OTM calls for today and on the 2nd to the last column is the % change for the day. now GME swung up and down \~2% throughout the day ending the day with a big dump. 

I watched the price action on my OTM calls all day and noticed that prices did change violently as the stock swung violently. But towards the end of the day when the stock dumped, options price did not change at all. If fact it went up a little.

From my understanding, any far OTM FDs get wrecked if the stock price goes down just a little bit. but this time it went up??? I'm just wondering what could have caused call options starting from 27 all the way to 40 caused the price to go up. I understand it could be like a liquidity issue but then who's buying all these options??? Could it be the institution?? I'm hella confused.

Many fallen brothers have been lost this week and we must ensure that we do not lose any more blood moving forward into the new year. Today, I spent the entire trading day obsessively dollar cost averaging on my PLTR stock position and figured out an effective strategy on how to effectively limit your downside risk exposure on this stock while it continues to tank. Get the fuck out of your option positions and stick to buying this stonk only until we start to see an actual reversal. If you are not already deep in the fucking hole already, dedicate 30% of your funds to your entry point and as it continues to drop every 20 cents consistently buy more shares. When PLTR rallies on the day chart then sell a portion or half of your position when you break even and wait for it to continue dropping and then continue to dollar cost averaging on your position accordingly.

Also, why they didn‚Äôt give my boy PLTR a fucking percentage?? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Leaps - Vega Plays For those who don't know their Greeks yet, go read the Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))) and then donate $2.75 of your 2020 gains to them so you get the tax write-off. Probably will cross post this with r/thetagang this weekend, but they tend to get uppity about Vega plays.

2020 had historically high volatility, but we have already started to see that volatility steadily drop over the course of the year. My thesis is this will continue to drop significantly throughout Q1/Q2 of next year and then level off once "normal" business operations resume sometime in the 2nd half of 2021.

Most people are familiar with Theta plays involving selling an option and running out the clock. In a nutshell, Vega measures how the value of an option will respond to changes in volatility (IV). If you are buying piles of PSTH, GME, PLTR, shares (etc.), you might consider selling a covered call far into the future with intentions of buying it back in 3-6 months. Yes, the stocks are going to go up eventually, but probably not as fast as Theta and Vega will drag them down over the next several months. Also, you should time selling it for a spike and buying back a few months later on a dip.

I have been doing this with mostly SPACs with mid-dated calls (3-6 months out), but also a handful of stocks like PLTR, DISCA, and some small caps I can't name for Leaps. My costs basis on the shares have been pushed down significantly and now all of my SPACs shares are significantly below NAV (below $20 for PSTH and below $10 for the others). I haven't always timed things perfectly, but overall this has been an effective strategy the past 3 months.

**Edit:  wouldn't recommend doing this with small/microcaps if volume for leaps is low.**

***Alternatively***, poor man's covered calls (PMCC) are quite viable, but be careful doing that on Robinhood because if your short leg gets called they will automatically call your long leg to cover it and you'll lose a bit of money. This runs counter to my thesis in the mid-run but for many stocks in the long run it's a good play as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying $PLTR be like.... Buy high sell low _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gamestop Visit About 30 minutes ago I went to GameStop here in San Diego to buy some used Switch games. It was nuts. Super packed with a line out the door. When I finally got in I found that they were wiped clean on used games, so I spoke with the manager and asked him about it. He responded with the following:

-This past holiday has been the busiest he'd seen yet

-They've been wiped clean on used versions of all major titles (Zelda, Smash Bro's, etc) for most consoles

-Nearby stores have been wiped clean as well. Some one came in asking for a specific game and got redirected to a store over 30 miles away

Definetly not anything groundbreaking, just more positive info on the Q4 earnings. I'm curious what you autists have seen.

Tldr: An autist asked people who worked on GameStop for a price point, they said to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME YOLO update (Shares ONLY) Dec 31 I had a hunch my hero [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) was still in since the MOASS hasn't even been started so I added a couple hundred shares to my portfolios.
