I am a chemistry nerd and medical student. I don't know shit about the stock market and I hope ya'll can point out where I am wrong by doing your own DD. Here's my DD about NNOX technology and I hope you can see why I'm excited about it.  

**What is NNOX?**

Here's their company statement:  We have developed a digital X-ray source enabling a cost reduction of imaging systems by orders of magnitude. We are a global company planning mass deployment of imaging systems. Our goal is to drive  early detection preventive healthcare as a new standard of care.

Basically, they made a cheaper and smaller X-ray device. They currently have a 2D model (simple X-ray) and a 3D model (CT scan) called the Nano-X ARC. That's their whole thing. It sounds boring as hell and their CEO Ran Poliakine has said on multiple occasions that their product is not groundbreaking: "X-ray is X-ray".

**Why is their technology special?**

It isn't. Traditional X-ray and CT machines use a hot spinning cathode that is large and requires active cooling or long off-cycles to not break. Cold cathode tubes are nothing special, and have been around for a long time. In fact, there are cold-cathode X-rays already on the market ([Meiden](https://www.meidensha.com/news/news_03/news_03_01/1231258_3190.html), [Carestream](https://www.cmxmedicalimaging.com/product/carestream-drx-revolution-nano-mobile-x-ray-system/) \+ [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/d9t1w5/testing_a_carestream_nano_portable_xray_unit/)).  What they are doing is comparable to replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs.

**Why is this exciting?**

Foxconn is why this is exciting. The cold cathode X-rays mentioned above use carbon nanotubes ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/437968a)). However, if you look at Nano-X images and promotional material, it seems to be almost like a semiconductor chip. They are making nanolithography-printed chips that can be cheaply mass-produced by Foxconn, who have invested in this technology ([Their engineer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11431-009-0156-7)). Nanolithography is basically printing on a very small scale, and I've been a major fanboy of this Northwestern scientist who pioneered it ([Mirkin](https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/project/dip-pen-nanolithograph/)). This is going to make these things cheap as hell (relatively).

**Monetization and business plan**

Their machines will initially be limited to whoever preordered them. They're selling them at a loss but charging per scan to make up the cost (estimated 1-3 years breakeven). Similar to game consoles nowadays. I don't have any idea what this means for their fundamentals but I can tell you the CT and X-ray machines at our hospital are constantly scanning and printing money for the hospital. Someone please tell me if this is a stupid business model so I can exit this position.

**NNOX started their IPO with a bang, then Citron and Muddy came in**

Their stock price was overbought on September 14th, and they were smeared as the next Theranos. Huge price drop. Keep in mind that their CEO has run a company into the ground, no academic papers were published, and no one has actually seen their machine work yet. The short sellers just pointed out the obvious. Then, NNOX announced they would showcase their device at the RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) where all the US radiologists visit (virtually) to bump shoulders and review academic research. Stock rose and dipped again in anticipation yesterday. The bar was so low. All NNOX needed to do was to show a working machine...

**AND THEY FUCKING DID IT (**[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcrzuODNhrs&t=14s)**)**

I got to see them do this shit live thanks to my professor! I bought the dip immediately (24 shares $88 avg) and it feels almost like insider trading. Basically, they showed a 2D scan and a 3D scan. The 2D scan was nothing special (XRAY is XRAY) but the CEO wanted to scan his own hand. However, the 3D scan was amazing. The 3D tomography was clearly noisy and crude, but the visualization is very high-res and crisp.

Some skeptics about the images say that their fake, but they look very real to me. The hand X-Ray matches his hand perfectly, and the 3D has peripheral noise as opposed to axial axial artifacts that a CT machine would produce. It looks like they may need some software engineers to tighten up image quality though. They also criticize him for not doing a live CT scan, which would take at least 15 minutes and would also give him an unhealthy dose of radiation. Another design flaw is that their ARC machine looks like it would not support fat people.

**Next moves**

They are filing an 501(K) FDA approval. I don't know much about their filing except that it's the "we're releasing existing technology" filing. These filings from what I know, are typically accepted. Some critics say they should be filing for a more exciting and risky FDA approval of some sort, but I think their tech is just old stuff used correctly. Hopefully their stock keeps rising as they approach approval next year.

**Major upside expected in the next 6-12 months with $FNMA---**

**Tldr:** This stock currently trades at **$2.50** and has gigantic upside in the next 12 months. The supreme court will hear arguments on December 9th challenging the government’s legal right to take over the company (hugely conservative court now that always vote against gov takeovers) AND Trump has gotten the ball rolling on doing it through the treasury with intent to do it before the Biden Inauguration. **Likely upside potential if either of these things happens = stock rises to $8-10.**

**Again this company is huge with a 2019 net income of $14.2B**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright you clowns, listen up. Incredibly strategic play here on Fannie Mae. Ever heard of it? Good.

This DD will give an easily  comprehensible  overview of FNMA and why this play is super compelling.

The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as **Fannie Mae**, is a United States government-sponsored enterprise founded in the 1930’s and, since 1968, a publicly traded company. The purpose of Fannie Mae is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities, allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market.

In other words, they basically buy mortgages (middle class people mortgages) from banks and chop them up in tiny pieces by issuing securities that are backed by them and then guarantee those securities. Basically, they are an insurer of super low risk assets.

Now this all may sound familiar and if mortgage-back securities sound familiar then you probably saw The Big Short or know a thing or two about the housing and financial crisis in 2008-2010. In the lead up to the housing crash, FNMA blew up because they were inadequately capitalized and started buying subprime mortgages (the big short explains this all well actually).

Following the housing crisis in 2008, Fannie Mae fell victim to a complete government takeover and the stock died. Shortly before the 2008 election, FNMA was place into conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. So basically, the government took FNMA over and injected a gigantic amount of money and capital into it.

In 2010, FNMA announced their stocks would be delisted from the NYSE. The Federal Housing Finance Agency directed the delisting after Fannie's stock traded below $1 a share for over 30 days. Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.

So, what was the outcome? At the time of the takeover, FNMA was written off and many believed it was destined for insolvency. But interestingly, the opposite happened. **In the years that followed, FNMA built capital and re-paid the loans back to the government with over 10% interest.**

Politics got in the way, however, and the Obama Admin refused to privatize the company and allow it to hit the normal markets again. The trump admin, however, was very interested in ending the games and removing government control, privatizing the company, and allowing it to re-list again on NYSE. Many of the bureaucratic steps necessary for this have already happened.

**This is where the timing of this buy is simply incredible. There are two upcoming decision points and a lot of context that make it likely this stock moons in the next 6 months.**

1. The Trump admin has 2 months remaining and some insiders believe strongly (and this is corroborated by the fact much of the leg work has been done) that they will make this deal prior to Biden being inaugurated. Trump treasury secretary has a particular fascination with this given his wall street background and wants to get the deal done.

**2) Secondly, and perhaps most important, is that on** ***December 9th***\*\*\*\*, the Supreme Court of the United States with hear a case as to whether or not the government expropriation of FNMA is legal or not.\*\* This again, is very important. The supreme court has changed dramatically in recent weeks and years and is now solidly a 6-3 heavily conservative court.\*\* Conservative courts are notorious for ruling against government take-over of private companies. The fact the court is hearing this case so soon after the most recent judge’s confirmation is likely telling (the court itself votes on which cases on appeal to even hear).

3) If either of these two things results in positive news for the reversal of the government involvement in this stock, insiders, including the **SPACMAN Bill Ackman** (whose holding company holds a big chunk of FNMA purchase in 2013 at around the current $2.50 price) believe that the stock will be guaranteed to rise by as much as 6X and at a minimum 2-3X. There would also likely be know delay in this rise, given how gigantic these companies are.

4) Finally, regardless of whether Trump or the Supreme Court makes this happen, things are on track for the change to take place under Biden in any case, it just may not be as quick and may happen sometime later in 2021.

The only recent news I can see that may cause concern was one of the vaccine manufacturers  had cut down the amount of vaccines it could produce but that was earlier and priced in, and superseded by the "implication" that a new stimulus was "close" to being negotiated in Congress.

Doordash valuation 23.8 - 27 billion approx. outstanding shares 317.7 million after ipo approx. raising about 2.8 billion about $75 - $85 last round raised in late June at 16 billion valuation. Had 1.9 billion in revenue in last 9 month about 543 million customers and adj. ebitda -149 million

Q2 revenue 675 million adj. ebitda 23 million

Q3 revenue 879 million adj. ebitda -43 million


Uber eat while is a part of Uber and ubers ride sharing has taken a hit you can say Uber eats approx. valuation is 37.3 - 56 billion (40% - 60% Uber value) outstanding shares 1.76 billion.
About 3.1 billion revenue unknown number of customers (remember seeing somewhere they had over 500mil customer too) adj. ebitda -728 million in 9 months

Q1 revenue 819 million adj. ebitda -313 million (Uber eats only)

Q2 revenue 1.211 billion adj. ebitda -232 million (Uber eats only)

Q3 revenue 1.451 billion adj. ebitda -183 million (Uber eats only)

GrubHub valuation 6.46 billion and shares outstanding 92.75 million and revenue last 9 months 1.316 billion and adj ebitda of 78 million

Q1 revenue 363 million adj. ebitda 21 million

Q2 revenue 459 million adj. ebitda 13.3 million

Q3 revenue 494 million adj. ebitda 43.7 million

supposedly doordash has 50% of market shares but I don’t believe that based off the numbers and number of locations. Uber had higher GOV and slightly higher revenues and both Uber and doordash had about 500 million customers still Uber reported slightly more. I believe Uber and doordash to be almost equal in market share Uber 37% doordash 35% GrubHub 23% other 5%. Now the question is GrubHub crazy undervalued if doordash and Uber eats both worth over 25 billion? Grubhub would be easier to pump lower float. But doordash is gonna have ipo hype

FCX has been steadily climbing since COVID and shot up to $24.57 immediately following market open today which was the signal to buy.

**What about IPOB ( Opendoor)?**

 For me it's a hold/wait. I missed the wave and most people did but it's apples and oranges can't compare the too. 

Majority people in here don't understand or own real estate and will say IPOB ( Opendoor) is more exciting because of Cathy Wood and it's ability to disrupt the real estate industry. Or they will say [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) is an angielist or something else. Again competition is good and not all business succeed. 

But basically Opendoor is 10x better at ibuying compared to Zillow but Zillow has the strongest MOAT at the moment and make Majority of their revenue from Buyer Agents(ME).

Rolls Royce was in the middle of restructuring after writing down hundreds of millions of dollars due to unanticipated maintenance issues on their Trent 1000 jet engines (common on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) when coronavirus hit and totally demolished the market for jet engines.

Additionally Brexit plus aggressive, reactionary Chinese foreign policy has impacted their ability to compete in many of the largest markets.

They have laid off thousands and were forced to raise a significant amount of capital. 

Buying now may be great for a slow climb to significant gains.

1. As both a major defense contractor and employer, the British government is unlikely to allow Rolls-Royce to go into bankruptcy (receivership is europoor English).

2. As the whole market knows, were on the back end of the virus saga and the jet engine market will start climbing out of this hole in the coming year.

3. [Hard Brexit is here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-02/supply-chains-latest-rotterdam-s-port-braces-for-brexit-chaos) Britain is about to start negotiating new trade deals that will prove to be nothing but positive catalysts for beaten down RYCEY.

4. Rolls-Royce sold their nuclear maintenance unit but kept their modular reactor program. They are leading a consortium that is [set to get significant funds from British, French and possibly other clients.](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/UK-commits-funding-to-Rolls-Royce-SMR) 


Financial times: 
   [‘ 	Each mini power station would operate for up to 60 years, providing 440MW of electricity per year — enough to power a city the size of Leeds.  The government's support “should deliver sufficient cash to get the consortium through building the factories and well on the way to construction of power stations prior to finding more money from other sources,” said one person with knowledge of the situation.   .......    	It would give vital support for the strategy of Rolls-Royce, a prominent UK manufacturer, of developing new revenue streams to reduce its reliance on the civil aerospace sector, which has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic.’](https://www.ft.com/content/d7016b80-e0c4-4444-a059-2daf32b9a4ab)



5. Additionally, despite COVID cancelling the E-Fan X project. [Rolls-Royce is a leader in both hydrogen and hybrid electric aircraft propulsion.](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/rolls-royce-presses-ahead-on-hydrogen-power-after-scrapped-airbus-project-1.1097892)

6. The new Trent UltraFan currently in testing is projected to offer 25% fuel savings and will be hitting the market just in time as it will take a while for aircraft manufacturers to start seeing big demand again. (Tired of linking shit, just google it.)

7. Lastly, as a major defense contractor and the designer of the new F35 VTOL powertrain and the engine builder for Britain’s 6th gen jet fighter ‘Tempest’ scheduled for 2035 they have a major revenue stream not impacted by COVID-19 and likely to benefit from increased militarization of European countries (Sweden and Italy are already in the tempest project with GB)

pricing on these options started making sense yesterday and I loaded up on calls. You have possibly upward sloping call delta for returns that are 50%+. While this is pricey, it is where options were when PLTR was about 20 bucks last time. This tells me selling pressure is near exhaustion.

As other people have mentioned, we have hit the long term trend line and have bounced off of that. I see one more retest of the trend line before we go back up. ~~Now we haven't hit the 38% retracement level of 32, which is around 20. So there is a chance we may go down to 20 before going back up~~. (Thanks  [brandimore](https://www.reddit.com/user/jbrandimore/)). We have hit the 38 retracement level at 22, which is also the long term trend support. So the risk ~~retard~~ reward is quite attractive now.

I see a move into near 38-42 by the end of the year. We saw similar moves by Nio and Tesla in the earlier part of their large 10x run-ups. I think there is a high likelihood the run-up for PLTR is only beginning. Based on sentiments on WSB, i see another 3-7 days of consolidation around 22-25 to shake out the week hands as well as burn off the 12/4 and 12/11 options before we will see a continuation of the upward trend.

From the FT

https://www.ft.com/content/5a5aa2a6-0888-49b9-92f5-8fbf967bf283?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6

Quick quiz: What do Virgin Galactic and Plug Power have in common?

On the face of it they are totally unrelated companies. The former offers day-trips to space for the unspeakably wealthy, the latter hydrogen fuel systems for equipment and electric cars. But both soared double digits Wednesday on seemingly no news:

What they share is that both have become the object of co-ordinated buying by users on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets. If you’re not familiar with this particular corner of the world’s most popular messageboard, it’s where retail punters go to discuss their punts, and much more besides. “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,” as the website accurately describes itself.

Scroll through it today and you’ll find dozens of posts boasting of giant gains on call options and straight equity purchases with Virgin Galactic and Plug Power, along with punter-favourites Tesla, Nvidia and AMD.

Normally retail investor activity is but a drop in the ocean in the $30tn US equity market. Not this time. The behaviour is so pronounced that options trading has been showing up in aggregate market data, as Jennifer Ablan reported Wednesday:

While the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq have surged to record highs in recent weeks, another rally has taken hold. The US options market has been experiencing a huge jump in trading — led by large-capitalisation companies including Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Disney, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Vishal Vivek, equity derivatives strategist at the New York-based bank, noted that trading volumes in US options were now almost as high as volumes on the underlying stocks, at 91 per cent. That is the highest level in at least the past 14 years, and about three times the equivalent percentage in 2016.

These co-ordinated attempts to take a stock “to the moon” does call into question whether it constitutes market manipulation.

After all, nearly every time a company’s share price collapses hurt executives, shareholders and government point the finger at a “bear attack” by evil short-sellers. Often taking legal or market measures to try and shut down the selling. But what about when a price shoots higher? Silence so far.

Question is: will the exchanges and regulators feel the need to do anything about it?

Oversight of US equities trading is a strange beast. Technically it is run by the Securities and Exchange Commission but fully-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets have a quasi-governmental status too.

All parties are governed by the Exchange Act of 1934, and on the first page one value seems eternal:

...there is an important national interest in maintaining fair and orderly securities trading, assuring the fairness of securities transactions and markets and protecting investors.

That stipulation is in part to ensure trades are done in an economically efficient way and that there’s fair competition between all. But it’s also to ensure: “the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities.”

You could argue that a bunch of people publicly discussing their plans on a free website qualifies on that score.

However, on the “fair and orderly” stipulation, the Reddit bull attacks arguably fail the test. There isn’t anything orderly about a stock exploding just because a bunch of retail investors decide they want it to.

To what degree the swing to commission free trading in the US has helped to fuel this collective behaviour is another thing worth bearing in mind.

In that context, what can regulators do? One thing they might want to look at is who exactly is posting on these websites.

During the dotcom boom, Yahoo message-boards and AOL chat rooms were the Reddit-equivalent. But, as we found out after the fact, not everyone was an impartial observer.

Take the story of John Freeman, who in the late ‘90s worked as a temp at banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. There, he became aware of mergers and acquisitions long before they happened, which he shared with his pals online. The game was up, according to Dan Davies’ book Lying for Money, when the SEC realised a giant flow of prescient market orders for a takeover target were coming through one stockbroker in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

FT Alphaville is not suggesting the same thing is happening here — after all, these bets are placed purely, it seems, “for the lols”. But then again, what’s to stop one company insider, desperate for whatever reason to make their stock rise, faking a screenshot of a giant call option trade on the site in the hope the herd follows? Not much, we suggest.

On the face of it Reddit users don’t appear to be aware of what they’re doing. Here’s one quote from a user looking to pump Microsoft’s stock:

Also if this happens to be illegal, I don't know about it so I'm safe.

This is the internet, so who really knows anything. If the quote is genuine, FT Alphaville isn’t sure the rationale will hold a lot of water if and when officials come knocking._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: why are AMC, CNK down?

All of the meme stocks, the PLTR, NIO, PRPL, whatever next week’s flavor is gonna be, are extremely volatile, and, you're probably not going to have them for 2+ years, but these people will. You can’t recommend they buy those, because, like, imagine how stupid you are. Then, realize that your parents actually made you, so they’re just as retarded too. They’re gonna buy PLTR at the top and get fucked by JP/Citron, because they don’t know any better. Even if it did, they don’t think about their ‘next play’. They’re already asking YOU for advice, I mean come on, they obviously have no fucking clue what they’re doing. You are assuming a risk to your relationship based on how stupid they are. But you also need to get them to shut up and leave you alone, so what do you say?

This is what you need to say. “Just buy SPY/QQQ and hold”. It’s foolproof. Even if the entire market tanks, you just say “well look at the S&P and the Nasdaq, the whole market is down, not my fault”. Then they’ll be happy with their 10% gains. You won’t be getting any extra inheritance, but you’re not going to get disowned. They’ll look up the chart for SPY/QQQ, be like wow it goes up, looks safe, they’ll buy and hold forever while you get drilled by your increasingly OTM calls. They may be able to buy you some Wendies as commission when you end up losing everything in your own account and have to move back home.

The price floor/support is at $22. However, there is a small chance, that with bad news it could also drop to $18 before a huge move towards $35. Although a few dollars will not matter if you’re in for the long term, dollar cost averaging would still be a good option.

Its a heavy weight with a light weight price.

When you realize that its comparable to the other tech giants and its only $24!!!!! You realize that price is a steal. You don’t even have to buy options, you can just buy stock and watch your money triple by summer. It’s an investment.

Here are my reasons:

•It will eventually be an operating system ( like Microsoft :[Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch) )

•It is backed by a billionaire

•It is backed by the US government

•This entire community loves the stock(mostly very rich people)

•They just signed a $300 million dollar deal… it’s on the website, is that reflected in the financials?If it is not, then I think the price needs to go up to adjust for that (asking not telling)

•This presentation is amazing: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc\_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)

•The company is expanding at extremely rapid pace.

I bought before the hype and I still believe in it now. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR GANG RISE UP _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GMHI -> LAZR baby ⚡⚡ GMHI announced its merger with Luminar and is now trading with the ticker LAZR.

In all seriousness this is a great stock. Luminar has the best Lidar sensors which every car is going to have. The CEO is this genius 25 year old big dick Stanford drop out who engineered the best Lidar sensors. They already have contracts which will give them like 70% of the market.

It was up 30% premarket this morning, and then a big profit taking run from small sellers drove the price down, as well as big institutions depressing the price to buy in. But the actual value is up there. I believe this stock will hit $50 in the next two quarters.

Ive seen elon blasting LiDar tech saying its trash:
https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/

"They're all going to dump lidar," Elon Musk said at an April event showcasing Tesla's self-driving technology. "Anyone relying on lidar is doomed."

"Lidar is really a shortcut," added Tesla AI guru Andrej Karpathy. "It sidesteps the fundamental problems of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy. It gives a false sense of progress, and is ultimately a crutch."

But also a bunch of companies are using it, considering even the fucking army uses it:
https://idstch.com/technology/photonics/military-applications-lidar/

"by combining the laser range, laser scan angle, laser position from GPS, and laser orientation from Inertial Navigation System. Additional information about the object, like its velocity or material composition, can also be determined by measuring cert"

Again i have shares in LAZR and i am probably going to sound biased but who is right here?

Papa Elon has never steered us wrong, but the might dick of the US Army hasnt either.

In my honest opinion, i feel that LiDar is in its infancy, and even if Papa Musk is right, LAZR can sell their tech to other industries like air travel/space/defense

TLDR: SPY 360 Puts 12/11  


I'm not going to lie, I tend to be a little bearish, but this looks like a great setup for a week long short. Over the last 3 trading sessions, SPY has hit the R1 resistance 3 times, but never breached it to close out the 6 hour candle. 6 hour RSI is at 66.5 (at the time of this post), which is almost at the 70 level after which it's considered overbought by all the algos.  


I believe that over the next week or so it should bounce of off the R1 and approach the pivot line (360ish level).  


This is not even considering all the stimulus talk starts and stops, which most likely won't get announced until the 11th (even if it does). So no immediate catalysts to the upside.

Well well well...looks like you degenerates didn't listen and are missing out on the gravy train here. CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.

Highlights of what you have missed since my last post:

* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System
* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.
* Craig Hallum upgraded CEMI as a buy today for $10 PT

That BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.

On top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.

Still long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.

**----Previous Post on 10/16----**

Listen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:

* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.
* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)
* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered in the United States immediately.

Their platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.

Any partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \~$4.62.

Good luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.

(DXCM) and Why I BOUGHT THE DIP and YOLO’d 80k. As you autists know, BUY THE FUCKING DIP. For the last few months, I have watched this sub decay into exclusively meme stocks, SPACS, EV, GYNA companies, Weed stocks, and a government backed Skynet. Instead of presenting real buying opportunities, WSB has been filled with pump and dumps and shit stocks. This is not that, this is a real market opportunity to make gains by BUYING THE FUCKING DIP. This DXCM dip has been completely overlooked by WSBets...because once again, you're all fucking degenerate autists. I know this because I am too, I participated in many of the swings and after breaking my neck a couple times, the whiplash caused me to do my own research and fall back on the most basic principle BUY THE FUCKING DIP.

I believe so strongly in this position that I have YOLO'd $80k into DXCM calls. You can see my positions and my ass at the bottom of this post.

Now my analysis of DXCM is broken down into 7 parts: The Product and Increasing Market Share, \~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~, price targets, Revenue, Earnings, Partnerships, Competition, COVID impacts, and most importantly THE DIP. This post is pretty long, but the TL;DR is that this company is recovering quickly from a massive dip, dominates the market, and presents a great tendies taking opportunity.

**The Product and Increasing Market Share**

DEXCOM is undoubtedly the best diabetes management device in the market and their market shares continue to grow as more Type 1 diabetics are switching from syringes and finger pricks to insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors.

Dexcom is currently the market leader in continuous glucose monitors. If you don't know what a continuous glucose monitor is, simply put, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracks glucose levels throughout the day and night and can alert Type 1 Diabetics if their levels go too high or low. CGM systems take glucose measurements at regular 5 minute intervals, 24/7, and translate them into dynamic data to show glucose direction and rate of change. Dexcom CGM tracks glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, while simultaneously sending glucose readings to the user's smart device or receiver every five minutes. Dexcom CGM then translates readings into dynamic data so that Type 1 diabetics are better able to manage treatment.

**\~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~**

**Price Targets and Strong Buy Recommendation** \- Avg Price Target of **$445.60**, Currently trades at $334

DXCM is currently trading more than $100 under its price target and is closing the gap rapidly as it recovers from its recent November dip. See the Analyst Consensus Rating below:

[AVG. PRICE TARGET $445.60](https://preview.redd.it/jceur9o6su261.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2c196f05dfd7bdf3444e42aa3066d4ac15e4b1)

DXCM is currently rated as a Strong Buy by almost all analysts.

[DXCM = Strong Buy ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x9gc0e8v261.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e967ca9c66ade9770a0419e6ab244a4c2114490)

**Steady Revenue Growth, Balance Sheet, and Growing Market Share -** Dexcom Revenue continues to steadily climb and just passed half a billion last quarter with positive cash flow on its balance sheet, a growing market share, and an increase in Continuous Glucose Monitor users worldwide.

[Continued Revenue Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/g031y7q60v261.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f86e4f844f99fb49e1d4d8ac09ece7ace2acdd)

**Earnings -** Dexcom does not miss on earnings and has consistently beaten expectations by wide margins. I expect they will continue to do so next year as more diabetics get back to regular endocrinologist appointments. See the graph below:

[DEXCOM ALWAYS BEATS EARNINGS](https://preview.redd.it/u6vuq1vfzu261.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e50be2755bc34b313d7dd6fafa0e2f480997fc9)

**Key Partnerships -** From Wikipedia - "[Tandem Diabetes Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Diabetes_Care) received FDA approval in December 2019 for Control-IQ, a closed-loop technology that uses Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump and the Dexcom G6 to "to automatically increase, decrease, or stop the delivery of insulin in response to the glucose levels of people with Type 1 diabetes." Dexcom entered into a partnership with Livongo, a digital chronic care management company, in January 2020 to share CGM data from the Dexcom G6 with Livongo’s platform. This integration will allow Livongo to incorporate the CGM data along with other patient data to provide health insights based on its algorithm to help patients manage their diabetes. In February 2020, Dexcom and Insulet Corporation signed a non-exclusive, global agreement to combine current and future Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring systems with Insulet’s tubeless insulin delivery Pod into the Omnipod Horizon™ System for automated insulin delivery. This will give the ability to adjust insulin doses based on Insulet’s algorithm or through their smartphone. The company also announced in March 2020 a partnership with Welldoc to integrate G6 CGM data with BlueStar, a digital platform for diabetes management. BlueStar will combine the CGM data with information on patients' activity, nutrition, sleep and other factors to help them manage their condition." [\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexcom#cite_note-25)

**Little Competition and Positive Market Sentiment**

There are 3 major players in the Continuous Glucose Monitor market. They are Dexcom, Guardian Medtronic, and Freestyle Libre. Dexcom is by far the most advanced, accurate and used device of these three. I will try to highlight the main advantages of the Dexcom over the competition, but I highly recommend you look into the reviews and research around the accuracy and features of these devices. The points below are from SugarMDs - [https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:\~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently](https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently)

1. Dexcom has nightime monitoring for increased safety - "One of the biggest risks that a person faces is highs and lows while they are sleeping. A Dexcom G6 and Guardian Medtronic (but not Libre) CGM system can monitor and alert you at night should your blood glucose drops. Unfortunately freestyle libre does not have that feature.  You can also choose to notify someone about your blood sugar levels by sharing your glucose data. The timely warning can prevent you from experiencing side effects related to highs and lows.
2. Accuracy - "Between the Dexcom versus libre, Dexcom appears to be more accurate in the low glucose ranges below 80 mg/dL compared to libre."
3. No finger pricks - The dexcom, unlike Guardian Medtronic which needs to be calibrated at least once every 12 hours, does not require any finger pricks to calibrate the device. This saves patients hundreds of dollars on test strips and is one of the best features of the device behind it's accuracy.
4. Customer Service, Reputation, and Retention - Top of the line customer service that is dedicated to serving patients. "If a sensor stops working or doesn’t insert correctly, tech support is easy to get a hold of. After a few questions, they will replace a sensor that does not work. They might even send two." [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre)

&#x200B;

**COVID Impacts**

1. COVID created increased awareness of the importance of monitoring underlying conditions. I believe this will be a huge driving force behind growing revenues and market shares for Dexcom. Diabetics are now, more than ever, acutely aware of the need to monitor their Diabetes closely and Dexcom is the best product for that.
2. Increased Dexcom orders as patients return to quarterly endocrinologist appointments. Although, Dexcom beats earnings every quarter, I believe they will have even larger beats in 2021 as more patients transition back to seeing their care providers in person and will be able to see the products for themselves in medical offices.

**Buy the Dip - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

In November, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen slashed his 12-month price target on the stock from $420 to $350. Biegelsen cited increased competition and pricing pressure in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) space following the approval of Abbott Labs' Freestyle Libre 3 CGM in Europe. Abbott's CGM system is reportedly priced at $1,066 per year, whereas DexCom's G6 device runs about $2,496 per year.

This slashed price target was unjustified and the Analyst Consensus Rating above confirms that with an average price target of $445.60. It was unjustified for two specific reasons.

First, there is major consensus and sentiment among diabetics that Dexcom is the most accurate continuous glucose monitor on the market justifying its higher cost (See here - [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre) or look at r/diabetes_t1 to get a feel for the love that surrounds the Dexcom and the impact that it has on the lives of Type 1 diabetics).

Second, the pricing differential did not justify such a drastic price slash. This is because for an ever growing number of patients insurance covers the cost of these continuous glucose monitors so price isn't a factor as diabetics always hit their deductibles due to insulin costs. Additionally, people do not skimp on price or often choose the cheaper device when it comes to their health. The reliability and accuracy of the Dexcom justifies its higher price. It's the best on the market and diabetics know it.

Anyway, as you can see from the graph. The stock has dipped from $420 to around $320 in the past month, but is quickly picking up momentum back towards the average analyst price target of $445.60. Moreover, pre-COVID the stock was trading at $456.23 and will likely blow past its ATH over the next year.

[Dip to $320 in Nov. Currently Rebounding back to $400+](https://preview.redd.it/8gla7g5dpu261.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d0c429c14096253284c6b447f67e012f4fac4b)

**The Play**

I think this stock will run and run fast over the next couple months in anticipation of February earnings and as institutions dump their money back into a stable medical company. I would recommend playing stocks or long term ATM or ORM LEAP calls as DXCM has low options liquidity atm. The idea is to profit from the November dip that I touched on above. I am in for $80k total. I am all in and believe in this position, I would not be posting if I didn't think this was a sure thing. These are the trades:

**1) $5k in DXCM $340c 1/15**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Buy 2021 Leaps on DXCM, they are the best products on the market and currently heavily undervalued and recovering rapidly from a major dip.

**\*Personal Note and Kiss My Ass\***

On a personal note, I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic that uses the Dexcom CGM. I transitioned earlier this year from the Guardian Medtronic CGM and the device has been life changing. It has lowered my A1C levels, made my diabetes incredibly more manageable, and conveniently links with my iPhone and Apple watch which has made it a very enjoyable device to use. I've also attached a photo of my device so you can also get a feel for what the Dexcom CGM looks like and so that you autist fucks can kiss my ass when this play makes you tendies.

Let’s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American.

[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)

Here is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.

We also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don’t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.

Here is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b)

\[Later EDIT\] - Jobless claims came in way better than expected : [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/Jscz1SZ)

Great news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.

We also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn’t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.

\[Later Edit:

\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top & bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%

\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\]

Alongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.

Also, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)

The only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company’s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.

We also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.

I think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don’t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.

This news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.

Other news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.

While Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.

So, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.

While [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.

Despite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+

What can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in… E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia.

While [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel & entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.

This companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don’t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.

And don’t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.

But the fact of the matter is there is just too much smoke for there not to be fire. I have seen a lot of "yolo" posts about this ticker that are 95% in the stock.... when you have a floor of 25% downside risk I don't think that qualifies as a yolo, more just an asymmetrical investment and probably a smart move in a volatile market.

This video pretty much outlines why it's a safe bet and a sound investment.

but that's not why I'm here. This has been a long time coming.

Let me start by saying that I got into "investing" years ago with a couple hundred bucks just fucking around on E\*TRADE spending $7 to buy $25 worth of stock only to find out it was $7 to sell it. Later on, I found out about an app called Robinhood that was made for window licking retards like myself. It was glorious, I could day trade up to 3x in one day before I lost everything and got locked out of my account for a week. I enjoyed it greatly.

Then on December 23rd 2019 I saw an article on Marketwatch about how Draftkings was going public thru a SPAC. I didn't know what the fuck a SPAC was but it was just days before Christmas so I had a couple days off to research it. I took the couple hundred bucks in my account and I bought all the $DEAC I could get my hands on. Since then I have found this sub with other degenerate gamblers and retards like myself. Between the success of $DEAC / $DKNG, $PLTR, and $TQQQ (and others I can not mention) I managed to turn that 2K into over $80,000

I have been following the $PSTH saga thru infamousbreadfruit AKA Yolocapitalinc on twitter, since early October...

The Jackie Reses situation is just too coincidental. She previously she spent seven years handling mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, the works at the Head of Square Capital for 5 years, then joins the board of $PSTH, then goes on Twitter and "liked" a picture of the Stripe logo... v sus if you ask me...

The recent influx of videos to hit twitter have the story

I don't come on here much to be honest but there's also some good DD that has been posted in the past that is easily accessible. Anyways I know I am going on and on but the point is I am going all fucking in.

I recently refinanced on my house to get a great rate and decided to take some cash out to "invest"...

I'm taking the 80K profit this year from that other shit, throwing the cash out from the mortgage (20K) into half option calls, half shares on $PSTH. Yolo is relative. I basically live paycheck to paycheck and this is well over a year's salary.

Its stores offer camping, fishing products, and hunting and shooting products. The earnings was announced yesterday and they were phenomenal. Their Q3 quarterly sales = 1/2 entire market Cap!

This one is undervalued by a lot!

The company made a gross profit of $334 million in last 3 quarters and trading at a market cap of $600 mn. It's insanely undervalued.Last 12 months revenue was more than that of SNOW ($1.2-$1.3 B) , yes, you heard it right.

The same store sales and e-commerce sales are through the roof and this trend will continue as people continue to spend outdoors, guns, shooting and camping.

[https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)

  
\`\`Upon analysis, it is clear that the Short Sellers Reports produced by the investment research companies were part of an orchestrated media attack aiming to promote short-sale-related capital gains by artificially lowering the share price of Nanox. As can be seen in the NASDAQ images below, this planned attack was successful. The share price of NNOX was favourably high prior to the release of the reports in the beginning of September 2020, and dropped significantly upon their release by Citron and Muddy Waters, and then again increased and stabilized in the end of November 2020. Furthermore, the fact that the Citron report has recently been moved into their archive provides some ancillary indication that this was, in fact, a planned short selling action \`\`

Very exciting company.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MYTHBUSTER: House passed bill to curb Chinese stocks listing. What does it REALLY mean for your $BABA, $NIO etc. Some first words, **I have no prediction on how these stocks’ price is gonna move**. I know many of you have a position on these names. And I anticipate that **my post will be heavily downvoted**. I only write because I despise **those trolls who spread fake information for their own benefit**. Even if a couple of people who read my post can avoid the pitfall of being conned, my effort is not wasted.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is this “Kennedy-Von Hollen bill” about?**

Congress established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect audits of public companies. Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**. This led to the massive scandal and eventual delisting of Luckin Coffee. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a company from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.

**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**

**BUSTED**. For example, $NIO uses PricewaterhouseCoopers **Zhong Tian LLP**, which is a **China-based** auditor. **PCAOB currently CANNOT inspect audits from $NIO, or $BABA, or many other Chinese companies**.

**Source**: the **official PCAOB website** where you can find that $NIO is listed as a DENIED ISSUER AUDIT CLIENT

[https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 2: PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is registered with PCAOB. This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIO’s audits.**

**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**. (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this far in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered. Wow.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**

**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 4: Because Trump’s TikTok ban hasn’t been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**

**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trump’s TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, it will become **legislation**.

If anything this tells you, **China did NOT prevent TikTok's US operation from being sold to Oracle. It won't be a surprise if eventually they will NOT prevent from these stocks being delisted.**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**

**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generation’s understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**. And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**

**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only “**TRY**” to comply with the regulations, but whether they “**CAN**” is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.**

**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)

“**China’s state security laws are invoked** at times to limit U.S. regulators’ ability to oversee the financial reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books and records and audit work papers**.”

It is outside companies’ power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they “**TRY**”.

**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.

“the adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**”

They may not, but they **COULD**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**

**UNCERTAIN**. I can’t imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact. Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?

If you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but it’s far from certainty**. They have not compromised on an “independent investigation of coronavirus origin” in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that they will compromise on their own state security law?

The negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10 years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Can these Chinese stocks go up? Not impossible. Can they go down? Also possible. Whether you buy or sell, consider the risks, and **don’t get manipulated by those who are spreading lies for their own benefit.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When Daddy Musk is looking out for employees but Goldman Sachs goes bullish. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The makings of an autist 😎 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If PLTR hits $30 by the end of next week I will film a video of me chugging hot sauce or ban.

You might be thinking: "Is this a 'sell the news' type event?"  
Answer: Yes and no.  
There are those that front-ran this stock's price action leading up to this event because they know how powerful of a catalyst this event can be. They will undoubtedly sell to secure profits AND to hedge themselves against the possibility that the demo fails (for whatever reason... HIGHLY DOUBTFUL btw).

But here's the kicker: if this event demo proves this company's technology - this will change the game of radiographic imaging as we know it.

A good company for once? not a meme stock? Well, I'm sure you guys will change that

Let me introduce you guys to Dropbox (ticker DBX).

Dropbox is a Cloud computing company with a market cap of 8.2 billion, meaning it's a small cap growth company. We all use cloud, the need for cloud is consistently rising day over day. The need for Cloud is not going away, so what makes Dropbox a buy over the other cloud computing companies?

1. It has a fantastic PE for a growth company. Yes, PE is not the end all be all, but with a forward PE of 19.42 as a growth stock in a hot sector, that is disgustingly undervalued. 
2. It's branding. Their branding and whole repertoire is centralized around small/midsize businesses. It shows the simplicity of using a cloud product. It's becoming a smart workspace in workspaces and schools alike. It is pretty much the only cloud computing company advertising to such. But don't let that make you think they aren't looking big picture, especially their CEO.
3. Their E signing of documents. If you retards think for a second that within the next 5-10 years all signings of documents wont be electronically, then your out of your mind. DBX is one of the few companies in the cloud computing sector doing this too.
4. Their shift in focus. They have started also focusing on the idea of a at home workspace, which I personally love. Although offices and workspaces alike will always love to unnecessarily bring people in just for the purpose of micromanagement, but this pandemic only showed that working from home is the future. I know many of my IC associates have said they will be doing their walkthroughs and meetings through zoom for the benefits. 
5. Their CEO. Drew Houston has been making some moves. He left a busy California city to move to Houston. This move is good for the future of the company, trying to focus on the vision instead of doing business-esch things. 
6. Not a speculative stock. It has beat on earnings for almost every single earnings report and it's revenue has been going up consistently for years. Analyst price targets are also very bullish, with the median prediction being +45% for the next 12 months. They are sitting on over 1.2 Billion dollars of cash, 50 grand is really nothing to a motherfucker like Dropbox. The only speculative thing I can find is that stock twits is outrageously bullish.

I'm back with a second post explaining option things.  I was overwhelmed by the positive feedback from the first post, which can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2a2j8/options_explained_a_quick_beginners_guide/).  Before proceeding, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the following topics (if you can answer these questions you're set):

* What is a call/put?
* What is the difference between Selling to Open and Buying to Open? Which has more inherent risk and why?
* What are At the Money/In the Money/Out of the Money for both calls and puts?
* What is intrinsic value?
* What is extrinsic value?

If you can't answer any of these please read the first post or simply Google/YouTube the things you do not understand.  If you are really struggling with any of them and you've tried these resources please don't hesitate to message me or ask your question in the comments of the first post.

In this post, we are going to cover:

* Credit vs. Debit
* Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls
* Cost Basis
* Selling Cash Secured Puts
* Debit Spreads

Grab your phone, open up your brokerage, and follow along.  I encourage the consumption of bourbon on the rocks and the listening of Mac Miller during the reading of this post.

***Credit vs. Debit***

* Credit - any money that a trader **collects** as a result of selling an option.  For selling calls/puts, if the seller places an Ask and the order gets filled, they will be credited with the money, meaning that it will immediately be placed into your account.
* Debit - any money that a trader **pays** as a result of buying an option.  For buying calls/puts, if the buyer places a Bid and the order gets filled, they ill pay the money for that option, and now they own that option.

***Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls***

Covered calls are an option strategy where the trader uses 100 shares of the underlying as collateral to sell calls.  The sold calls should be out of the money and always needs to be above the cost basis of the owned stock to avoid loss.  This is a safer strategy than selling naked calls (selling a call when you do NOT own 100 shares of the underlying) because if the price of the stock breaks through the strike price and the buyer exercises you will not realize an immediate loss by buying shares above the strike and selling them for the strike.  Lots of words, lets take a look.  I, again, am going to use $MSFT as an example.  This is only an example, any sentiment towards this stock expressed is solely hypothetical.

We're neutral to bearish on $MSFT and don't think there will be any significant price spikes in the underlying.  We'll look at selling naked calls first.  Below is the 12/31 options chain for $MSFT Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ogjfcs7iw261.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b2cc8b36f737034b0f1945b8b5f46d4e72bc8b2

We think $MSFT is going to trade sideways or decrease in value, so we are going to sell the 12/31 $220.0C.  You put in an ask for $4.05 and it is filled, so that $4.05 is technically immediately credited into your account.  Robinhood will not immediately show this in your account because it is an open contract but as the option price changes those changes will be reflected on your daily P/L chart.

* Best case scenario for you: $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, resulting in the option decreasing in value.  At any point when the option is under the price you paid for it you could Buy to Close the call and that would be your realized profit.  For example, on 12/15 $MSFT is trading at $200.0, the call is now worth $2.05, so you could buy to close your contract and your gain would be $4.05 - $2.05 = $2.00, or $200.
* Worst case scenario: You go to sleep in the evening, smiling because you think you made an easy $4.05, you've figured out how to beat the market.  BUT $MSFT announces that it has been contracted by NASA to put computers on the Moon.  $MSFT rockets up to $300.  The person that bought your calls decides to exercise, this means that you would have to BUY 100 shares of $MSFT at the current market price and sell them at the strike price, or $220.0. Your max loss would be \[($300 - $220) x 100\] - $405 = $7,595.0.  If the price went higher or you had more than 1 open contract you could see how this is insane risk.  THIS IS WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SELLING NAKED CALLS.

Covered Calls - Now lets say we have 100 shares of $MSFT that we bought during a dip at $205.0.  We are bullish on the stock and are holding long but don't think that it will go to $220.0 from $214.0 so we sell the same call.  Again, the money is *credited* to the account.

* Best case scenario the stock finishes just below the strike on the expiration date and you can sell another call further out for more premium.  If the stock is at $219.0 on the day of expiration, you can just sell a $230.0 call further out and collect more premium.  You can continue this until you are assigned the stock.
* Worst case? The underlying goes through the strike to $225.  Your total gains for the trade would be \[($220.0 - $205.) x100\] + $405 = $1,905.0.  Now, if you hadn't sold the call you would have realized more gains if you sold the 100 shares at $225, but only by $95.  ***THE IMPORTANT PART IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 SHARES AS COLLATERAL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THEM AT THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.***

***Cost Basis***

* Cost basis is the price you paid for a stock minus any credit you have received for selling covered calls, receiving dividends, etc.  This is done at the single stock level.
* Example:
   * We buy 100 shares of $WSB at $100.0 per share
   * We Sell to Open an OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00.
   * Our 50% profit trigger is hit, and we Buy to Close the contract at $.50.
   * Our new cost basis is ($100.0 - $.50 = $99.5)
   * We Sell to Open another OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00, but this time we let it expire worthless.  Our new cost basis is ($99.5 - $1.0 = $98.5).

Cost Basis is important when selling covered calls because you should not sell covered calls for a strike price that is less than your cost basis.

* Example: Our cost basis on $WSB after a few CCs is now $90.0 and is trading at $110.0
* $WSB takes a little nose dive with the market and falls to $80.0.  If we sell an $85.0 CC for $1.00, we reduce our Cost Basis to $89.0, but if we are assigned, we realize a total loss of $400.0 if the stock finishes anywhere above the strike price and is exercised.

***Selling Cash Secured Puts***

The risk associated with selling naked puts is the same as selling naked calls, but reverse.  If you sell a put, the stock tanks, you are now obligated to buy from the owner of the option the stock on the higher price than market.  For example, you sell a $20 put, the stock falls to $10 and the owner decides to exercise the option, you are now OBLIGATED to buy 100 shares at $20.0, when they are selling on the open market for $10. Your loss would therefore be \[(20.0-10.0) \* 100\] - credited premium = Max Loss.

Selling a cash secured put is selling a put with an adequate amount of cash available to buy the shares if the underlying does drop below the strike and the option is exercised.

Suppose we are neutral to bullish on $MSFT so want to collect premium by selling a put.  Look at the option chain for 12/31 $MSFT below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uk00p9qj3w261.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e785e8ae40260339e52dc44034187fbc63551e9

We can sell the $MSFT 12/31 $205.0P and be credited $2.41, or $241.0.  There are a few things that can happen.  When you do this, you will need $20,500 to be a cash secured put. (Strike Price \* 100 = Necessary Collateral)

* The price of the underlying goes up, and the seller of the option (us) can *Buy to Close* the contract.  We have no further obligation to sell any shares at the strike price and the money that was held for collateral is released.  The profit of the contract is simply the difference in the premium when we Sold to Open and the now lower premium when we Buy to Close.
* The price of the underlying trades sideways.  This will result in theta decay of the option and we can Buy to Close once we hit our desired exit price or % gain.
* The price of the underlying drops below the strike price.  If this happens you can:
   * Buy to Close at a loss to release your collateral.  This might be a significant loss
   * Be assigned the stock.  By doing so you have now aggressively entered $MSFT at a lower price than it was on the day you sold the OTM Put.  As soon as you get assigned the shares, guess what we can do?  Sell to Open a Covered Call

Some quick notes on the CSP, you should only sell CSPs on stocks you are comfortable with being assigned and ones that you are bullish on.

Selling CSPs and CCs are the fundamentals of doing a strategy called the wheel, but not a strategy I am going to get into with this post.

***Debit Spreads***

Debit spreads are a way to bet on the directional movement of a stock while reducing both your maximum loss and your potential profit.

*Call Debit Spreads*

This is done by Buying to Open a call while Selling to Open a call with a higher strike price.  This allows us to use the credit received from Selling to Open (-1) contract to help lower the cost of the option we Buy to Open (+1).  Look at the $MSFT 12/31 options chain below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k20t4uy48w261.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cde6714f5d20c7a86651e713b226fbfe4f0b624f

We want to Buy to Open the $MSFT 12/31 $220.0 call, which would cost us $4.15 if we do not use a debit spread.  BUT if we simultaneously Sell to Open the $225.0C for $2.56, we can lower the DEBIT we would need to open this trade.

1. This lowers the debit we need to pay for our trade from $4.15 to ($4.15 - $2.56 = **$1.59**)
2. This limits our max profit we can receive from the trade to the difference in the strike prices, so \[($225.0 - $220.0) \* 100\] - $159 = $341.

Check out this example put into Robinhood desktop below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fl46ylb3bw261.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f49eba1d7ceaf4ad64aebe85fd765aad426ac3cc

Notice my absolutely God Awful drawings.  We need to confirm that we have selected the right strike prices on the right expiration, and that we are DEFINITELY Buying to Open the lower strike and Selling to Open the further OTM higher strike. Robinhood helps us autists by putting a "Call Debit Spread" by our order.  If it says anything but this, you fucked up.  Notice circle 2, where we can see the strikes of the Calls we have chosen to Buy/Sell.  Below is what it looks like in mobile.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y4e47tlew261.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c87ee245fac4ac48067bb8ea8c7b4d10612218a

Below is a P/L chart I created with [optioncreator.com](https://optioncreator.com).  This chart is only applicable on the day of expiration and will change depending on DTE and volatility.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivge56pwew261.jpg?width=1407&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44946041b92c31004c74fb4807d95cb7f1e2bb0e

Notice how our max loss is realized until the stock price passes through our long call, increases, then it flattens out and is capped regardless of the price of the underlying at our max profit at stock prices $225.0 and beyond.

*Put Debit Spreads*

The process is exactly the same but inverted.  You are Buying to Open a put and Selling to Open a put with a lower strike price, but the principles are all the same.  If you don't understand this, let me know and I can type out a full example like the one above.

***Conclusion***

I hope that this in addition to the first one have been helpful.  I think these strategies will give everyone on this sub an advantage over the house we are trying to beat.  Again, best of luck.  Trade well.  Trade with passion.  YOLO but YOLO smart.

Panda.

P.S.  Due to the positive response from last one I will continue to create these until told to royally fuck off.  I am also creating a YouTube to explain these as best as I can and share my portfolio and my trading strategy.  If you're interested in seeing them send me a message and I'll send it out when its off the ground.  I will not solicit on this page ever.

If you are smarter than me and find errors (which I'm sure there are) comment so I can fix.

Ok WSB, so in July I blindly picked a stock based on the fact that it was having a good morning, and maybe I could make a quick $1,000 if it keeps going up all day.

I bought 1,000 shares of NTZ for $2.52/share.  I think it ended that day under $2.  It ends up tanking down to the low 1s and staying there for a while.  

I forget all about it, then one day notice that my losses have been erased and it has started to turn a profit.  When I bought it, I thought it was another Covid stock, but turns out to be an Italian furniture company.  

It slowly starts making me a few hundred dollars a day, then all of a sudden it goes up to 4, 5, and a week later up to 7.  At this point I should sell but don’t.  Then it goes under 5 and a week or two later, back in the 7s, where it started this week.  Of course NOW I definitely should sell, but still I don’t.  Yesterday it jumps to 9 and today 11.   Surely it can’t keep going up?  Right?  Am I crazy not to sell tomorrow morning? 


TLDR:  So I am now up almost $9,000 profit from a $2,500 investment on a stock I bought by mistake!  Do I try to squeeze more out of this, or am I absolutely retarded if I don’t take my gains and run!

UPDATE:  
Thanks for all the great advice and great shit talking!  So I decided to set a trailing stop quote at 8%.  Which I believe means that I get to continue enjoying gains until it slips to 8% of the most recent high, where it will automatically trigger a sale at that price.  If anyone can confirm this, that would be great!  

And wouldn’t you know it, the stock is still going up and in the 12s today.  I don’t know how to explain it, but I think I’m locked to sell at no less than 11.22 which would be $8,700 profit!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Not a PLTR post that's struggling to moon, but a huge potential to put some cash in your pockets.

**TL;DR -** Dad, sister, and I bought KODK while mom stayed on the sidelines and had the right to say "I told you so". **Mom knows best.**

===================================================================================

Ladies and gents, it's storytime. I hope you get cookies, milk, and your PLTR jacket because I think this is a pretty good one.

**1.** It all started on 28 July when KODK got the $765M loan from the U.S. government and branch into pharmaceuticals (in addition to cameras and cryptocurency). I sent the news to dad. Because of 1) the fact that the loan was bigger than the market cap at the time and 2) some boomer nostalgia of long-lost Eastman Kodak greatness, dad immediately told us to "BUY" KODK.

**2.** So the next day, even while the stock went parabolic, I bought **1000 shares @ $28:**

https://preview.redd.it/hmqxlj746w261.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff7a289d6b307cc6b441bcceae99c1134c1e0ff

For those who participated in this KODK pump, you remember the euphoria and gambling mania on 29 July. Stock was halted at least 5 times and each time it opened like $3-4 higher. I thought I (and dad) were pretty smart.

**3.** So of course I bought **450 more shares** (and at this point dad and sis also bought in), all the while with Mom warning us that "stonks can't go up like this":

https://preview.redd.it/swha6r056w261.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f7521512c244537d76e15563da3865d6fc3ba3

**4.** Then people started saying the loan wasn't quite right, and that there was some sketchy insider trading going on. Here was the position a few days later with my now $30 average:

https://preview.redd.it/x641hbs56w261.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef15e4526e5ced769fac0adcb2195738db33236

**5.** And it kept tanking even more:

https://preview.redd.it/6ah9cvf66w261.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=241ce2c2bc52b8508adf96accce103ba04daaefc

**6.** Eventually it reached the $6 levels ($5's, even). Like a prudent investor, I DCA my way through times of trouble, thinking to myself maybe KODK is gonna build its own electric truck soon. I bought **3,550 more shares to lower my average to $17's:**

https://preview.redd.it/29c6qs276w261.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d8b44b988646deb57ac43956f385e30ea9c1ca

**7.** With Donald Pump going out of office, I finally decided to sell. I don't have the exact screenshot from the app but according to my IBKR PortfolioAnalyst report I sold at **$7.11:**

https://preview.redd.it/uob8vix76w261.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=76afe1ceca430f8da0bf69877a292b8be3718de1

“Palantir Tried Buying Morgan Stanley's Stake in Value Feud
By Lizette Chapman  and Sonali Basak

Bank’s mutual funds have repeatedly cut value of small holding
So Palantir sought to buy it back at lower price, people say
Silicon Valley startups sometimes bicker with their investors, but tensions between Peter Thiel’s Palantir Technologies Inc. and Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds are reaching a breaking point.

The banks’ funds have cut their valuation of a minor stake in the secretive data-mining company several times in the last two years, estimating the company’s worth at just $4.4 billion as of September 30. That’s well below the appraisal of several other investors in the firm and just one-ninth the valuation Morgan Stanley’s own bankers predict the company could fetch in an initial public offering.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My college money tehe 🤪 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If PLTR closes above 27.50 this week, I’ll be sending $1,000 to some random autist. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to lose 25% in 1 week.

Hopefully someone can explain exactly why this occurs, still extra tendies regardless though.


I've noticed this with all of my recent trades:


- When I make an order to purchase shares at 'market', I end up paying a much HIGHER price than the actual market value displayed.


But 


- When I make a purchase using a limit (using the limit provided by the broker based off the current market value at the time of purchase (because I wanna buy asap), not a manually set one), I seem to pay a much LOWER price than the actual market value displayed. 


In addition to this finding, I've noticed


- Whenever I sell shares at 'Market', I end up selling the share at a noticeably higher price than what the displayed market value was at the time of purchase.


But


- Whenever I would try to sell using a limit (again, set by the broker based off the current market value at the time of the sale (because I don't want to wait a bit for it to be sold), not a manually set limit), I end up selling the share at the lowest possible amount closest to my limit. 


***Example:***
(these numbers are estimates, though they closely resemble the original numbers. I just don't have the exact data saved).


Buying at market: 


I was day trading shares of a certain stock, I made an order for 600 shares at market value ($0.781) but when the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.792. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade down $6.60.


Buying at TD's market value based limit:


I was day trading shares of the same stock, I made an order for 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off the current market value)($0.781). When the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.775. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade up $3.60.


Selling at market: 


After riding the wave, I notice the share value starting to hint at decline and I decide to close my position. I make a sell order for my 600 shares at market value ($0.812), but they ended up actually selling for $0.819. This discrepancy led to me closing my position with an extra gain of $4.20.


Selling at TD's market value based limit:


Shredded the 'nar, now I want to close my position and lock in those sweet sweet tendies. I make a sell order for my 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off current market value)($0.812). These shares ended up selling at $0.813, leading to an extra gain of $0.60.


Based off of this example, if I had bought these 600 shares using the TD base limit, and sold at 'Market, I would have an extra tendies gain of $7.80.


Now the case can obviously be made that perhaps the market simply changed during the time it took me to close my position, to which I would agree. BUT I've been experimenting with this "discrepancy" for hours, and through over 30 seperate day trades - and my results have remained constant. If it was due ONLY to the market changing, then wouldn't at least a few of the results be reversed?

While record breaking FBI Gun Background Checks are but an indicator of increased $AOUT revenue, it’s an indicator that I am taking to the bank. I bought 325 shares for $13.75.

AOUT reports earnings on 12/15/2020 and last earnings report on 09/03/2020 resulted in the following:

Non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 beats by $0.56; GAAP EPS of $0.13 beats by $0.34. Revenue of $50.47M (+51.9% Y/Y) beats by $9.4M. E commerce net sales grew 130%, while traditional channel net sales rose 15%. Shares +6.3%

Moreover management has been [buying up shares](http://openinsider.com/AOUT)

Another great indicator are the record background checks. Last years November gun background checks came in at 2,574,752. This year was significantly higher. Last data was released on October 31st and beat the previous years checks by nearly a million!! This November beat last year by nearly 1.1 million.

Look up the above brands on their website. Additional companies that smashed earnings that sell AOUT products are DKS & BGFV. 

AOUT is on a pullback and trading on the cheap (Below Book Value Per Share). Earnings on 12/15 and I’m betting on a solid beat. This stock has a very low float of only 12 million shares. So AOUT can swing hard on news.

#**Sector and Industry**

Garmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific & technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).

Garmin is the [second largest scientific & technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMN’s market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industry’s [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name).

#**The Company**

Garmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:

Segment|Revenue
:--|:--
Fitness|28%
Outdoor|24%
Aviation|20%
Auto|15%
Marine|13%

The COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmin’s marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmin’s exposure to aviation.

As of the Company’s [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmin’s fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Company’s outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.

Garmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: “[an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf).” In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.

The Company’s aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmin’s most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.

#**Autoland**

Garmin’s Autoland is “[taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/)” by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runway—all while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmin’s research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmin’s Autoland should not be underestimated—it could become the base for full autonomous flight.

Autoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. “Autoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.”
In third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.

I spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He “expects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade.” Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.

*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).

Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company’s consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).

Price|$118.48
Market Cap|$22.78B
P/E|22.51
PEG|3.23
P/S|5.70
Dividend|2.04%

Still, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.

#**Conclusion**

Garmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Company’s investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.

I personally believe Garmin’s investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.

Time to go skiing boys _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $YY = TikTok + OnlyFans Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.

Yes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.

Congrats on making it this far. Let's get started!

$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.

But it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.

That's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.

How can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.

YY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.

So... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.

Compare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.

Holy shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...

* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?
* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?
* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?
* And finally – you may ask yourself – if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?

**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.

**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.

That's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSJ - Options Trading Is More Popular Than Ever Despite the Risks _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A point of view on RKT Hello everyone. 

I am aware that some of you have curious as to why RKT has not taken off already. I wish to know too. I sent some info analysis to an elder of mine who has been showing me some things that he has learned over his decades of investing and he sent me the following reply. 

I hope to get some thoughts on this reply. 

“My reactions to Rocket Mortgage are:
1.If all goes well like their predictions these would be good returns BUT
2. In the 2008 crash one strategy was for a big organization to form a separate mtge
company, and sell the stock in this separate corporate entity. Then the new entity loaded up
with second rate mortgage risks (which of course paid higher interest rates) which the shareholders could (from a practical point of view) not really evaluate. When many of these mortgage borrowers went south and could not pay this had a major impact on the profitability of the overall return of the portfolio of mortgages. This then had a dramatic  effect on the price of the mtge company stock, The losses did not affect the big organization which also benefited from all the underwriting fees which indirectly were paid for by the mtge company shareholders. Many of these holders would not have invested in low quality, high risk mortgages directly if they had known the level of risk they would be running. There is plenty of boilerplate (cover-my-posterior) language in the fine print of what you sent me.” (Here he is talking about the analysis report I sent him)

“3. Will the Biden administration promote a booming economy with more regulations and higher taxes?
If the economy slows down the first to suffer will be these lower grade mtge's. I personally don't like
complexity when it can be avoided by a more direct approach. Of course, if interest rates are high enough
an organization can survive even knowing that a number of lenders will fail along the way. Loan sharks
have played this game forever. Maybe that is not what they are doing here but I see no references stating that Rocket is seeking only high quality lending risks--the kind JPM is glad to issue loans to itself.
I may be wrong but I did not get a "good feeling" reading this material. All these so called certified
evaluators have (as pointed out) some conflicts of interest because they are paid by JPM, What does
an independent evaluator who sells only info to its customers and has no advertising or other relationship
with a "Rocket" think? Probably no one is covering this entity so you will never know.Do you want to be
a high interest rate money lender to a group of higher risk borrowers? If so, Rocket might be just the ticket.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $COTY DD - Get rich with Kylie and Kim. Good day my fellow tards. You ever get jealous of big-titted Kylie in her $20M Calabasas mansion while the rest of us common folk are eating ramen and noodles? Well this is the play for you. Coty, a fashion conglomerate with terrible historical performance is turning their Titanic around. Coty bought a 51% stake in Kylie Cosmetics since it wants to step away from stingy boomers and join the Gen Z train. They then doubled down by buying a 20% stake in Kim K’s KKW beauty. They’re selling their shitty assets to improve their balance sheet as well. They got rid of their hair products division known as Wella. The tides are turning as they beat the living shit out of their recent earnings which sent the stock up 30%.
It’s time to get your crayons out as we pull out our treasury map known as the stock chart. 
This thing was at $13 pre-Covid when they had no clue what was going on in the fashion space. Now they got new management, e-commerce strategy and the Kardashians and it’s at $7. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is gonna boom since vaccines are being approved and store reopen.

Long story short, the business is going for young customers and online growth with influencers. KKR Private equity stepped in and told these losers what to do. These people don’t fuck around, they’re here to make shit happen. This thing is going back to $12 easy peasy. It’s at $7.35 right now after being stuck in the shitter at $4.

Positions.
The part you’ve been waiting for. Literally any strike under 15 will do. I suggest you pull up a random number generator between 1 and 15. Buy a call with whatever strike you got cause this is the money train to Valhalla boys.

Really hard lesson to learn (stupid decision playing with margin) but also FUCK TD Ameritrade. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What you need to know about the HFCA act passed by the House today. Since many of you probably don’t read before gambling your 401ks, this should help you sleep tonight:


1. The Senate already passed the bill over the summer, and today It was passed by a democrat run house.

2. The bill aims to make foreign companies let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversee the auditing of their financial records if they want to raise money by selling stocks or bonds to the U.S. public.

3. Many top meme stocks you guys are trading are already independently audited by trusted western auditors. (NIO is independently audited by Price Waterhouse, it says so on their website)

4. This likely wont cause anymore volatility than we’ve seen unless Biden’s administration goes full retard, since this has many implications for both sides.

Which made a lot of sense so I picked up a few puts Monday a little after open when it was up about $4.50 at its peak around $50 so they ended up being super cheap. This worked out pretty good so when it spiked back up a little Tuesday I added closer to the money puts to my position. Which has paid off since they are down about 20% in the past 2 days.

 But I just wanted to take a minute and thanks u/maxprtr for his DD that was un related to the memes and look forward to seeing any of your future plays.
