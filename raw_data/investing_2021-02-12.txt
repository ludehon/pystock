 Does money even matter to the Fed at this point or have we entered magical number wonderland? https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=B0Oh

&nbsp;

I made a post like this about 2 years ago. And I'm doing it again because I think it's time to bring out my "Repent for the end is nigh" cardboard sign.

At the link above is a graph of the federal reserves balance sheet. As you can see, and as most of the finance folk of this sub know, we started the quantitative easing program after 2008 to get us out of the recession. It worked pretty damn well.

So well in fact that the Fed never stopped doing it. They now have exercised unprecedented control over the market. This comes with the inevitable exponential growth of their balance sheets. 

&nbsp;

Assuming we continue this trend I have a few questions for your perusal.

1: Can the Fed QE to infinity?

2: We saw that when they started to reduce QE even just a tiny bit the market corrected. While this could have been coincidence can we say with any chance that if they tried again it would do the same?

2.5: Is it safe to say that the growth of most of the companies traded on the market is directly tied to QE? If so wouldn't this count as trillions worth of corporate stimulus? 


3: Rationally assuming QE is not infinite, and recognizing the strain covid is putting on all assets underlying the market, what will be your status in our new post apocalyptic world?

4: If QE is infinite then we are truly in an infinite growth utopia.

I hope everyone rest this weekend, clear your minds from investments for a strong next week (This going to Short - Mid Range Investors and not Long Term Investors, you guys can keep doing everything you usually do)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A threat to our real estate investments: Climate Change and Insurance While this sub mostly discusses trading in the stock market, many of us are also invested in the real estate market, so this article may interest you.

**TL;DR**: Risks to real estate from increasing natural disaster frequency are not not priced in. Mechanics behind how risk is spread out could mean rapidly spreading economic harm.

Some of you may remember 2008, the tumult of the housing bubble, and subsequent collapse in prices. Today housing prices are again at an all time high, outpacing inflation in a similar fashion to 2008. This has many folks who have money in real estate on edge. However, there are significant differences between today's market and that of 2008 in that the [demand appears to be real and the supply constrains appear to be real](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/NationalSummary_3Q20.pdf). But I am always on the lookout for weakness in this space since the housing market accounted for [15% of GDP in 2018](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11327.pdf) (and is probably more in 2021). Weakness here tends to spread through the economy and affects all investments in one way or another.

Therefore, I present to you a very interesting threat to the housing market: **climate change**. In the following Harvard Business Review interview with John Macomber (a senior lecture in Harvard Business School) he lays out this threat as manifesting itself through the insurance sector.

[https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis](https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis)

**For those who don't want to read the whole thing, I'll summarize as best I can**: Climate change is rapidly increasing the rate of natural disasters from hurricanes to flooding to wild fires. Insurance premiums are yet to express this primarily due to government intervention (IE states providing disaster relief and mandates to insurers). The risks to real estate as an investment are increasing rapidly, yet society appears unaware and the market is not pricing this risk in. When state governments and the federal government realize they can no longer to afford to subsidize the rebuilding/repairs to homes there is risk of the system snapping as insurers go bottom up and premiums shoot through the roof.

What's more insurers are actually insured themselves by "re-insurers" (bet you never heard of them before right) who then slice off some of the risk by providing insurance-linked securities called "catastrophe bonds." These are bought by investors who essentially get paid to take on some of the underlying risk. So the risk is spread out multiple steps away from the actual asset: your home. Sound familiar? This is eerily similar to the way mortgages were packaged and sold in the years leading up to 2008 (mortgage-backed securities). It is difficult to say how spread out and linked with the rest of the economy these catastrophe bonds are.

The fear is that housing prices are getting overinflated because the physical risk to the property are hidden from public view. Govt funds dry up. Insurers suddenly feel the full brunt of the increasing frequency of natural disasters. Premiums go sky high. Catastrophe bonds become worthless. Perceived wealth suddenly dries up and the contagion spreads through the whole economy. *Pop.*

There is more to the interview and if your interest is piqued I'll let you read the rest, but this is the point I want to discuss with you all.

**My Take:**

I was reminded about this hypothesis after Reuters did this article today about huge insurance rate hikes in Florida: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111)

Now, I'm no expert in real estate or insurance, I'm just a guy who owns some property. But like any investor I want to make sure my investment is worth the value its assigned and that potential risks are mitigated. What concerns me about this scenario is how the very real risks caused by climate change to real estate are *not being talked about in the public sphere*. What else would climate change and the subsequent increase in natural disasters have a direct impact on except for real estate.

It is really hard to say if this situation could actually lead to a massive collapse of the housing market and subsequent economic recession. As John Macomber states the ideal situation is that these risks become more apparent over time and the risks get priced in. If so, it would provide mainly a downward pressure on the real estate market rather than trigger a collapse. I actually think this is the more likely situation when the market is taken as a whole. Surely certain pockets will experience higher risk than others.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

Even pushing upwards to $80 today, there is a lot of room for growth as Tinder is one of their few competitors. Don't underestimate the power of women flocking toward a company that offers female empowerment during an era where women want nothing more than equality, and the "Me Too" movement inspired us to take the reigns.

Please enlighten me.  

Let's talk about futures contracts for *imperishable goods*, lets just use "widgets" as an example, and let's assume there is *no margin or loan or leverage or fractional escrow involved.*

**Here is my (maybe wrong) understanding of how a futures contract works:**

When you purchase a futures contract you agree to buy or sell widgets at a certain price at a later date. Without any margin (borrowing) involved, the company that set up the contract (the broker) holds/locks the full amount of both the widgets and USD in escrow until the agreed-upon date, and then just swaps the two accounts on that date. Basically they hold the money in one hand, and widgets in another hand, then swap hands at the end of the contract.

**What I don't understand at all:**

The futures contracts sell at almost the exact same price as the current value of widgets. Why not just purchase widgets? If I buy a contract today for 1 widget at $1 on June 30, and on June 30 the price is $2, I made $1. But if I outright bought 1 widget today at $1 and sell on June 30 for $2 I would make the same amount. Why would I want to tie up my money in an escrow account for months and risk the escrow company going under during that time if I could just buy the underlying asset? I'm so confused. 

**Maybe the price of the futures doesn't always exactly track the current price of the underlying asset?**

When/why would this happen? Is it a sign of anything?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Preparing to fight a bear (market) someday The market has brought so much growth to many portfolios over the last 10+ years, it's been a wonderful ride. I've developed decent skills identifying sectors that are in favor, buying and holding low cost index funds and sector ETF's focused on technology and innovation.

Long-term charts of market performance show there are periods of decline. Sometimes weeks to months (Covid in February - March of 2020) and sometimes a number of years (August 2000 - March 2003). My portfolio was reduced quite a bit between 2000 and 2003. I held on, rode it down, and back up.

Just like earthquakes, fires, and floods, it's good to think through a plan before the event comes. What's your plan to make it through a bear market?

Some presumably wise investors like having some cash on the side to pickup bargains during downturns. Some did that during the Covid drop. There are others that would either short the overall market on the way down, or buy inverse ETF's (ProShares for example. *Side note*: holding leveraged inverse funds for a long period of time, even a few days, can lead to unpredictable results due to decay.) If you have a longer time horizon until retirement, riding it down and back up would likely be better than selling at some point and missing the rebound.

What's your plan?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ITRM and pharma investing Hi Everyone, this is my first semi-dd post on here. I got into $ITRM for about $500 a few days back without really knowing anything about it, a foolish move by a green investor. Only foolish because I bought it without knowing anything about the stock and just saw some conversation about it on stocktwits.

Well, since then it has gone down, so I decided to learn about what it actually is and if I should be patient or cut my losses. I have learned some about FDA approval processes, offerings, urinary tract infections, and that drug companies can exist for some time hemorrhaging money without ever having released a drug before! I found this all to be very interesting! I'd like to share the basics of what I learned, and also get opinions on this stock....

The company as mentioned, is a "clinical-stage pharmaceutical company", which I take to basically mean they have no approved drugs yet. My friend called it a gofundme for drugs when I explained it to him lol. They have been working on one drug, oral antibiotics for treating UTIs, which currently does not exist.

They have complete phase 3 (of which there are 4 phases) trials with good results and have applied with the FDA for approval(NDA). Approval for this drug is on FDAs "priority list", meaning if approved it is somewhat fast-tracked through the approval process. Expected approval is July of this year.

From my research I gather that the majority of drugs that pass phase 3 and apply for NDA are eventually approved. Something like over 80%. The company has also recently made a public offering of almost 2 million shares to raise capital that will cover operating expenses until 2023 (that happened a few days ago). They also recently created an agreement with a firm that specializes in assisting drug companies in the final phases of development to bring the drug to market(also very recent activity).

The stock price has really only gone down since the IPO and is currently at almost an all time low.

To me, it seems like the approval of this drug is imminent. Why would they be partnering with a company to hash out the logistics of the release if this weren't the case? Why would they still be raising capital if this were not the case? I have a strong sense that the drug will be approved.

Are there any experienced pharma investors here that can chime in on this or give their thoughts?

Does it follow that if the drug is approved the price will go up as I predict? Or is the price built in?

I think there is still quite some dd to do on this such as what would the drug cost and how many people need it, what is the competition, etc. Starting to look into these things but it gets pretty complicated.

Still a lot to learn but I feel good about this investment after my initial blindfolded dart throw.

Thanks for reading._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19) Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry I got the day wrong in the title but the date 2/16 is correct). Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn’t realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies.

Just a question about options value .

So I'm aware that theta decay is the time value of an option and the closer you get to expiry the more the value of the option drops if it hasn't met the strike price yet.

My question is are any of those losses permanent? I've found that my options tend to "step" down day on day and it doesn't seem like it gets back to the same level as the day before even if the value of the stock I hold options on nears the strike price. Is this just the effect of the compounding of the averages of all of my call options that suffer theta decay?

Edit: Thanks for the silver!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point Ok guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and  modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not  accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

**What do you guys think about this?**  I might be wrong and many hedge fund legends  have  lost billions  shorting this stuff, but at this point the poop smell is just too much.  Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

The  other interesting point is that if TSLA falls, it might take  down the  entire market with it, or at least a good portion of the  NASDAQ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $WFC - Wells Fargo DD; Why I am bullish on Wells Fargo Big Bank, won’t bust.

Who they are and the market situation:

CTHR is a US based jewelry company specializing in moissanite and synthetic lab grown diamonds. They've been around since 1995, but have only recently begun to grow with the growth of the synthetic diamond market.

The lab grown diamond industry is growing quickly, by 2030, the [global market volume of lab-grown diamonds](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1078280/global-market-volume-of-lab-grown-diamonds/) is forecast to be nearly 19.2 million carats, compared to its current 6.2 carats. The technology to produce synthetic diamonds is rapidly growing, it already takes mere weeks to produce from start to finish today.

As a company that got a foot in the door early on (in my non-professional opinion) Charles and Colvard are in a fairly good position to continue to grow and maintain a solid holding in the new synthetic diamond industry over the next decade.

TL;DR: If you're wanting to get into the gemstone stock long haul, in my personal opinion, indicators look to point that CTHR should do fairly well over the next 10 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good sources for bubble discussions I am quite new to investment and have the last year invested 90% of my money into a tech fund and have I got like 20% profit, like everything else in the marked.

Amtech Systems ASYS provides capital equipment to the semiconductor industry especially those that supply chips for autos.

ASYS started lest year quite nicely with rapidly rising revenues and then coronavirus hit and all the semiconductor companies stopped their expansion and went into capital preservation.  This hurt ASYS and took what started as a good year and made it OK.  For a small company they have little debt and 45 million in cash.  

This year is still Covid effected as many orders are in the urgent discussion phase.  So revenues this quarter came in at 18 million at the high end of guidance but lower that a pre Covid first quarter last year.

Going forward ASYS projects Q2 2021 to be at 18-20 million vs 14.5 million last year.  The discussions with big names since they provide equipment to 3 out of the top 5 power semiconductors is getting urgent.  You should listen to their conference call to hear more.  

A larger alternative to smaller ASYS would be Applied Materials AMAT which will see huge growth due to all the capital expansion.  This is pretty heavy with the supply shortage being such big news.

I took the most important ones and updated it for the current market.

>Things that have never happened before are bound to occur with some regularity. You must always be prepared for the unexpected, including sudden, sharp downward swings in markets and the economy. Whatever adverse scenario you can contemplate, reality can be far worse.

Nassim Taleb calls these “Black Swans”:  an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight)hindsight. Examples would be the Internet, the personal Computer, World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and of course the Coronavirus.

These all changed countries or continents for decades.  With shutdown still in place in several countries in the world the economy’s output is much lower than it was at the end of 2019 -  yet we reached an all time high in the stock market. New Mutations are evolving and there might be a sharp downturn in the future or there might not. History taught us that market crashes are much more common than we think. So it is important to be diversified in different asset classes, industries and countries to be protected against those changes.

&#x200B;

>When excesses such as lax lending standards become widespread and persist for some time, people are lulled into a false sense of security, creating an even more dangerous situation. In some cases, excesses migrate beyond regional or national borders, raising the ante for investors and governments. These excesses will eventually end, triggering a crisis at least in proportion to the degree of the excesses. Correlations between asset classes may be surprisingly high when leverage rapidly unwinds.

With interest rates in Europe being partly negative and extremely low in the US, people are lulled into borrowing to get onto the Party of rising stocks, and that on margin. Margin on Portfolio reached an all time high in December of 2020 and the number of retail traders thanks to Robin Hood exploded even with the recent controversy. In addition - central banks in Europe and the US are printing money like there is no tomorrow. These money policies have driven stocks to a new high. And the excess of government debt mirrored that progression. Action always have consequences - but however harsh they may be one thing is certain: If the current price is higher, the returns won’t be as great in the future.

&#x200B;

>Nowhere does it say that investors should strive to make every last dollar of potential profit; consideration of risk must never take a backseat to return. Conservative positioning entering a crisis is crucial: it enables one to maintain long-term oriented, clear thinking, and to focus on new opportunities while others are distracted or even forced to sell. Portfolio hedges must be in place before a crisis hits. One cannot reliably or affordably increase or replace hedges that are rolling off during a financial crisis.

We all chase profits, that is just how it is. However conservative positioning and a long-term oriented perspective is crucial. Most people in 2000 thought they would buy the dip when their favourite stocks started to decline, however the decline didn’t stop. The Nasdaq posted a loss of 77%, which would take 15 years to regain the dotcom bubble. During the financial crisis many couldn’t sell their stock because there were no buyers - even retail investors that thought they could get out couldn’t.

During it Janus Funds were similar to ARK today. Investing in modern technology companies and industry they were one of the top cutting edge technologies. Janus were lauded as great money managers but the end of the bubble resulted in brutal loses. Cathie Wood is one of the smartest investors today, but one has to keep in mind the inherent risk that comes with her investment strategy.

Similarly we saw extreme loses in GME. Chasing after returns purely on performance will not result in great results.

&#x200B;

>Risk is not inherent in an investment; it is always relative to the price paid. Uncertainty is not the same as risk. Indeed, when great uncertainty – such as in the fall of 2008 – drives securities prices to especially low levels, they often become less risky investments.

This is the quintessential art of investing. Your returns will entirely depend on what price you paid. Microsoft was a great company, but buying it during the dotcom bubble would leave you 15 years with no returns and several other well known companies like Cisco or Intel never reached their dot-com peak. Your returns are entirely dependent on the price you pay and so is the risk factor.

&#x200B;

>Do not trust financial market risk models. Reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled. Attention to risk must be a 24/7/365 obsession, with people – not computers – assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time. Despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics, the markets are governed by behavioral science, not physical science.

Because of this behavior we see certain securities being extremely highly valued like Zoom at the moment and certain sectors being very depressed like oil until recently. Yet oil is seen as extremely risky, even though the projected use of oil will increase in the next 10 years. That means that you can find bargains all the time. Those bargains are declared risky -  while the overvalued stocks are declared safe. Microsoft after the dotcom bubble only recovered in 2016. 15 years of no gains at all -  yet now Microsoft is treated like a company that will be a great stock forever. It is a great company, but the same was thought about companies like Polaroid or Kodak - we saw how it turned out.

&#x200B;

>Do not accept principal risk while investing short-term cash: the greedy effort to earn a few extra basis points of yield inevitably leads to the incurrence of greater risk, which increases the likelihood of losses and severe illiquidity at precisely the moment when cash is needed to cover expenses, to meet commitments, or to make compelling long-term investments.

This can be highly dangerous and I see it all the time here on reddit. Someone wants to use the money in 3-5 years to buy a house, yet instead of proposing a portfolio that is safe and diversified in several asset classes, most propose a stock only portfolio and sometimes even sector or ARK ETFs. Research has shown that a stock only portfolio will beat pretty much every other asset allocation -  that is over the long term. Due to the ups and downs of the market it doesn’t guarantee returns in 3-5 years or even worse can lead to loses. From 1929-1954,1973-1982 and from 2000-2013 the S&P 500 has shown long stretches of no absolute return. Investing before a correction that you cannot foresee would result in either big loses or in the inability to purchase that house -  often both. So be conservative when you need the money.

&#x200B;

>The latest trade of a security creates a dangerous illusion that its market price approximates its true value. This mirage is especially dangerous during periods of market exuberance. The concept of "private market value" as an anchor to the proper valuation of a business can also be greatly skewed during ebullient times and should always be considered with a healthy degree of skepticism.

This is especially true today. Many stocks are currently at outrageous prices. I don’t talk about the FANGMAN stocks -  these have great growth and while still being historically overvalued not outrageously so. Several EV/Green/Biotech/Weed/Technology stocks are seen as the next big Google without decent cash flows and while competing in the same space.

This is especially true for unprofitable companies at the moment. According to Joel Greenblatt:  If you bought every company that lost money in 2019 that had a market cap over $1 billion, and so they’re about 261 companies, you’ll be up 85 percent so far until today. Something like that won’t be sustainable.Looking at the fundamentals behind the business often makes it clear how unreasonable some of these numbers are - and what returns should be expected of them (often negative)

&#x200B;

>You must buy on the way down. There is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up, and far less competition among buyers. It is almost always better to be too early than too late, but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy.

We saw that during the financial crisis and also again in 2020. Those that bought on the way down were generously rewarded. You never know when the bottom will hit especially since everyone will run around in panic like a beheaded henn. Researching the fundamentals of a company one can score great businesses for cheap. However they might go down a bit in the short term due to market panic.

&#x200B;

>Financial innovation can be highly dangerous, though almost no one will tell you this. New financial products are typically created for sunny days and are almost never stress-tested for stormy weather. Securitization is an area that almost perfectly fits this description; markets for securitized assets such as subprime mortgages completely collapsed in 2008 and have not fully recovered. Ironically, the government is eager to restore the securitization markets back to their pre-collapse stature.

As SPACs and Bitcoin dominate the current market this warning is very important. SPACs and the companies behind them haven’t had the greatest return over the long term. With the explosion of SPACs going public, chances are high that those financial products can be very dangerous. Add the risk that SPAC managers often get big compensation packages and try to hide information to increase the price (DOJ Investigation from Clover), these investments should be taken with the utmost caution. Not only that but they also compete in the same space.

The same applies to bitcoin. While I believe that cryptocurrencies will have a bright future, they have yet to be tested during prolonged market downturn where the market was negative not just a few week but several months or even years. No one know what the price will be then and some investors might wake up to a bad surprise. It is important to know these risks.

&#x200B;

>Ratings agencies are highly conflicted, unimaginative dupes. They are blissfully unaware of adverse selection and moral hazard. Investors should never trust them.

That what makes short seller research so important. While there are a lot of crocks in the financial market (both on the long and the short side), these people often find what the rating agencies or investment banks ignore. If you invest into a company and there is a short report don’t dismiss it - often they include information that was previously overlooked.

&#x200B;

>Be sure that you are well compensated for illiquidity – especially illiquidity without control – because it can create particularly high opportunity costs.

The OTC market absolutely exploded in 2020. Many of these are highly illiquid. Be prepared for the risk.

&#x200B;

>Beware leverage in all its forms. Borrowers – individual, corporate, or government – should always match fund their liabilities against the duration of their assets. Borrowers must always remember that capital markets can be extremely fickle, and that it is never safe to assume a maturing loan can be rolled over. Even if you are unleveraged, the leverage employed by others can drive dramatic price and valuation swings; sudden unavailability of leverage in the economy may trigger an economic downturn.

Everyone takes debt at the moment. It is so cheap that many companies use debt to do buybacks or otherwise increase their price. Other people trade on margin and governments don't seem to care about debt. That can be highly dangerous. No one can control interests rates over the long run and bankruptcy is the most surefire way to delete any investment returns. Peter Lynch said: “If you have no debt it is very hard to go bankrupt”. While businesses with little or no debt might not rise to the same degree, they will reduce the chance of a wipeout significantly.

&#x200B;

>When a government official says a problem has been "contained," pay no attention.

&#x200B;

>The government – the ultimate short-term-oriented player – cannot withstand much pain in the economy or the financial markets. Bailouts and rescues are likely to occur, though not with sufficient predictability for investors to comfortably take advantage. The government will take enormous risks in such interventions, especially if the expenses can be conveniently deferred to the future. Some of the price-tag is in the form of back- stops and guarantees, whose cost is almost impossible to determine.

We saw that in March the Fed stepped in and bailed out the market. A decrease in interest rates and intense money printing. However the question is: How long can it continue and what will happen to those expenses in the future? All action has consequences and we saw that some of them can end quite bad.

Seth Klarman also added some false lessons, that are relevant without commentary.

**False Lessons**

1. There are no long-term lessons – ever.
2. Bad things happen, but really bad things do not. Do buy the dips, especially the lowest quality securities when they come under pressure, because declines will quickly be
3. There is no amount of bad news that the markets cannot see past.
4. If you’ve just stared into the abyss, quickly forget it: the lessons of history can only hold you back.
5. Excess capacity in people, machines, or property will be quickly absorbed.
6. Markets need not be in sync with one another. Simultaneously, the bond market can be priced for sustained tough times, the equity market for a strong recovery, and gold for high inflation. Such an apparent disconnect is indefinitely sustainable.
7. In a crisis, stocks of financial companies are great investments, because the tide is bound to turn. Massive losses on bad loans and soured investments are irrelevant to value; improving trends and future prospects are what matter, regardless of whether profits will have to be used to cover loan losses and equity shortfalls for years to come.
8. The government can reasonably rely on debt ratings when it forms programs to lend money to buyers of otherwise unattractive debt instruments.
9. The government can indefinitely control both short-term and long-term interest rates.
10. The government can always rescue the markets or interfere with contract law whenever it deems convenient with little or no apparent cost. (Investors believe this now and, worse still, the government believes it as well. We are probably doomed to a lasting legacy of government tampering with financial markets and the economy, which is likely to create the mother of all moral hazards. The government is blissfully unaware of the wisdom of Friedrich Hayek: “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”)

TLDR:  This is the top, lads._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [Yahoo Finance] Uber's Plan for a Profitable 2021 Requires Questionable Accounting https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubers-plan-profitable-2021-requires-210146426.html

Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported earnings for the fourth quarter on Feb. 10. Despite posting another big loss, as the market expected, the ridesharing leader promised investors that profitability is at last on the horizon. Indeed, Uber claims to still be on track to achieve profitability in 2021 on an adjusted basis.

Adjusting to losses

When public companies report earnings, they are required to use an accounting standard known as generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP accounting allows analysts and investors to evaluate corporate performance across a range of businesses and industries with a common set of assumptions and definitions. On a GAAP basis, Uber lost $968 million in the fourth quarter, which is largely in keeping with its performance in recent quarters.

Uber, however, does not confine itself to merely reporting GAAP earnings. Like many other companies, Uber also likes to include a number of non-GAAP metrics, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Such adjustments can, according to writer and analyst Will Kenton, make it more accurate measure of financial performance than ordinary Ebitda:



"The adjusted Ebitda measurement removes non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may distort Ebitda...Standardizing Ebitda by removing anomalies means the resulting adjusted or normalized Ebitda is more accurately and easily comparable to the Ebitda of other companies, and to the Ebitda of a company's industry as a whole."




With an adjusted Ebitda loss of $454 million in the fourth quarter, less than half the loss it booked on a GAAP basis, it is easy to see why Uber has been a fan of the metric since before it went public.

Promised profits encourage analysts

Even on an adjusted basis, Uber has continued to post steep losses, but that may soon change. Company management has repeatedly promised that positive earnings are near at hand. This prospect has been met with an enthusiastic response from Wall Street, garnering a number of analyst upgrades ahead of its latest earnings print.

Despite the challenges presented by the economic and social disruptions of 2020, Uber is still on track to achieve positive adjusted Ebitda in 2021, according to Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai. In the company's Feb. 10 earnings press release, Chai reiterated the goal of turning the corner on profitability this year, if only on an adjusted basis:



"In Q4 we continued to deliver improving Adjusted Ebitda performance, up $171 million quarter-over-quarter, and remain well on track to achieving our profitability goals in 2021."




Uber's continued confidence appears to have kept most analysts onboard in spite of a somewhat lacklustre overall result in the fourth quarter. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak, for example, declared in his post-earnings update that Uber's "mixed" financial results failed to undermine his confidence in the company's ability to scale its operations profitably.

When a profit is not a profit

While creative Ebitda adjustments are far from uncommon in corporate finance these days, Uber's approach has raised several eyebrows. The ridesharing company has actually become somewhat notorious among finance sleuths for its aggressive accounting practices. Indeed, as Jordan S. Terry of Stone Street Advisors observed on Feb.11, Uber has a track record of rather "breathtaking levels of audacity" on that front.

Of key importance is Uber's exclusion of stock-based compensation from its adjusted Ebitda calculation. While SBC is technically a non-recurring expense in a corporate accounting sense, it has been standard practice at Uber and shows no sign of stopping. On Feb. 11, stock market analyst Keubiko delivered a particularly withering assessment of Uber's ignoring key expenses:



"UBER is going for the gold in the Adjusted Ebitda Olympics. Highly profitable if you ignore the expenses."




Uber is effectively "adjusting" a significant portion of its expenses out of existence with, at best, a tenuous justification. As legendary short seller Jim Chanos (Trades, Portfolio) pointed out on Feb. 11, negating the adjustment turns Uber's promised profitability into still more losses:



"When UBER says it will be 'profitable' in 2021, that means they will lose $300-400 million in the 4Q."




My verdict

At its most basic, profitability is a fairly black and white affair. A company either makes a profit or it does not. While the prospect of Uber's near-term profitability may encourage some analysts and investors at first glance, a closer look at how the company intends to calculate that profitability probably ought to give them pause.

In my assessment, Uber's reliance on questionable adjusted Ebitda metrics to define its profit trajectory could prove problematic over time. While improving adjusted Ebitda can point the way to eventual profitability, the company will only truly be profitable when it can deliver positive earnings on a GAAP basis. There is little prospect of that happening anytime soon.

5 hours ago, Morgan Stanley set a PT of $27 for $FSR:

https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3246514&headline=FSR-Fisker-initiated-with-an-Overweight-at-Morgan-Stanley

Since the report, it has risen 8.74% in the after-hours, putting it at $16.79. That's a 60% potential gain at a PT of $27.

This stock ran to $23 in November off a $26 pt from Credit Suisse. A couple $15-16 targets sent this into a long accumulation range that its finally ready to break out of.

Fisker has failed previously with car companies specifically, so why is it different this time?

Do I think it's a great long term hold? No. But the Morgan Stanley valuation alone is a big enough hype to raise the price well above $20 in the short term according to my research.

Positions: $FSR 3 contracts $18.5c 3/5_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APXT - The Dark Horse SPAC To anyone looking for a great play that's been quietly flying under the radar, let me introduce you to one of the best SPACs this year that's barely being talked about.

Apex Technologies / AvePoint Inc.

In November of 2020 AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider announced a $2B merger with Apex Technologies. The deal is expected to close this quarter and AvePoint will begin trading under the new ticker AVPT.

Why is this one of the most undervalued SPACs right now?

1.) All Star Leadership

Both Apex and AvePoint boast great leadership teams. At Apex, Jeff Epstein (lol), serves as the co-CEO and CFO. Jeff has held board/executive positions at companies such as Oracle, Twilio, Nielsen, Booking Holdings among others. The other co-CEO, Brad Koenig has served as the Global Head of Technology Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs for 15+ years and has served clients such as Dell, eBay, Microsoft, SAP, Veritas, Oracle in advisory capacities. Both Jeff and Brad will join the board of AvePoint once the merger goes through.

The current CEO of AvePoint Tianyi Jang, who's 23 years in the industry include positions at Deutsche, Lehman Brothers, and Citadel will remain as the CEO. The rest of the executive team boast past positions at companies such as Deloitte, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon, Merril Lynch and many others.

2.) Total Addressable Market

We all know how huge cloud computing is and will continue to be through the future. This is no new news. AvePoint estimates their TAM to grow to over $33B by 2022. As a strategic cloud partner of Microsoft and a 5x Global Partner of the Year Recipient, they're very well positioned to grow along side Microsoft and the cloud computing space as a whole. This growth is only being accelerated by the pandemic.

This partnership also allows a large competitive advantage as AvePoint offers the only full suite of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage, and secure data in Microsoft 365. Within the 7mm cloud users, previously mentioned there's some blockbuster Fortune 500 companies relying on AvePoint's technology everyday.

3.) Financials and Growth

Full Year Total Revenue for 2020 closed somewhere between $148M and $151M, up 29% year over Year. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short Term Investments total approximately $70M as of December 30, 2020 with a \~14% EBIT margin. The company also remains completely debt-free.

With an additional $252mm in cash on its balance sheet from the transaction, there will be plenty of room to grow. Some of the avenues AvePoint plans attacking include; selling more to existing customers, increasing SMB footprint, capturing a larger share of the Microsoft Cloud Customer Base (currently only 3% with no meaningful competition in the space), and expanding target industry focus and international targets.

Been holding 200 shares since late November and am shocked this merger isn't getting more attention. In the year of the SPAC, this one stands out as one of the best. I see at as a great simultaneous growth and value play and wanted to share. Cheers.

[Chart](https://ibb.co/WG29fWx)

Since I entered my trade it hasn't gone down, but since I've been in,  I've been seeing clear manipulation holding it down to these levels. Options expire tomorrow too.

BP has a bad rep among oil company investors because of their transitioning to green energy by 2030. So many point to Exxon Mobil as being the clear pick for a long term hold if oil is your thing, which is probably true especially with oil being at pre-pandemic highs at the moment, however I'm not long term anything, swing trading is my thing. 

Oil prices did spike my interest with BP regardless, I also saw BP as the most undervalued major despite recording its first annual loss in a decade, the reporting of which didn't drop it below resistance levels.

I started doubting my entry of BP as the stock drifted sideways for most of the week. I had a brief moment of hope on Monday that I'd get a quick flip and an early exit when the stock spiked 6% on news of BP securing offshore wind deals, but I wanted more and since then it was pushed back down and consolidated.


Exxon Mobil had an ex dividend on the 8th of feb and up to ex dividend, starting on the 29th of Jan it had a massive run up. BP ex dividend is on the 18th of Feb  and I'm expecting a similar run up. Expecting the price to rise next week as the shorts close for Ex Divi day. If they don't then they'll have to foot the Divi bill to shareholders. I also expect some retail dividend flippers to hop onboard during the run up pushing prices up further. I'll be closing my position on the 18th and looking for a new opportunity.

None of this is financial advice obviously.

Let me know what you guys think_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Momentus (SRAC) - A Space Infrastructure Company ****Please note this is not financial advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts.***

 &nbsp;

**Space Industrialization**

 &nbsp;

I want to start by noting that I think the industrialization and commercialization of space is a sector that is going to see tremendous growth in our lifetime. The current size of the global space economy is expected to grow from an estimated $415 billion to $1.4 trillion by 2030, driving demand for transportation and infrastructure services in space. It is clear to me why Cathie Wood is introducing an ARK Space Exploration ETF, since this will be another booming industry. I'll share a quote from Elon Musk:

 &nbsp;

*"You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars."*

 &nbsp;

The colonization of Mars is going to be one of mankind's greatest challenges and an objective that I strongly believe is achievable in a few decades. But it's not just Mars, it's the entirety of space that has virtually endless opportunities for growth. NASA, SpaceX, Starlink, Virgin Galactic, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Astra, and many more companies are at the forefront of making this possible. But there is one that really intrigues me: Momentus. 

 &nbsp;

**What is Momentus?**

 &nbsp;

*"As we continue to develop new technologies and improve the capabilities of our rides, we will continually introduce more services, each contributing to the further industrialization of space. To realize a future where humanity is equipped with all it needs to flourish throughout the solar system, we need to be able to mine, manufacture, build, and generate power in space. Momentus will make this possible."* - Momentus 

 &nbsp;

[Momentus](https://momentus.space/), founded in 2017, provides infrastructure services necessary to facilitate the inevitable need for space industrialization.  Their core service is in-space transportation. What are some of their services?

 &nbsp;


* Space transportation services - first hub and spoke model of space, providing last mile delivery in partnership with key launchers, such as SpaceX

* Satellite as a service - hosted payload services that significantly decrease the cost of developing, launching and maintaining satellites

* In-orbit services - maintaining, repairing and refueling satellites in orbit

 &nbsp;

There is a lot more really cool stuff they are envisioning to do, like equipping vehicles with robotic arms capable of performing proximity maneuvers, docking, and refueling. They also expect that extending the lives of larger spacecrafts, relocating or deorbiting satellites, conducting salvage missions, robotic repairs, etc. will be done in a day's work for their service fleet. Momentus stands apart from other companies because their whole business strategy revolves around space infrastructure services, which is only going to become more and more necessary as the space economy becomes further and further developed. They have a key partnership with a few companies, most notably SpaceX, and many customers such as NASA and Lockheed Martin. 

 &nbsp;

I urge you to take a look at their [investor presentation](https://momentus.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Momentus_Investor_Presentation_2020_10_12.pdf), as there is some seriously cool things they are working on that will make Momentus one of the leading space industrialization companies in the world. The last page includes their financial forecasts, which I am not taking too seriously right now given this is an up and coming sector with massive potential.

*Bought into my position today - 115 @ 26.37*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Huge volume and Price increase. No news. Hey Investing, 

I wanted to know from anyone well seasoned in stocks their opinon why we would see a large influx in volume and price on zero news? 

Is there any avenues i can take with the company to find out why? 

Only reason how I can understand it is a typical supply and demand situation. 

People will want increasing amounts of Graphite and they got it. But they arent mining it yet. 

Perhaps digging will commence soon and its insiders scooping it up??

I'm heavily invested in this company, it's 100% a long term play and would like to better understand the situation i am in maybe others have been following Focus Graphite and have some insight or dealt with similar corporations before. 

Hopefully this is all for nought and news drops over the long weekend. 

Any direction is appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Perion Network (PERI) Earnings Update I was in last month, even after this run up it’s still grossly undervalued I think. (PERI P/S 2.5x, MGNI 30x, TTD 40x, PUBM 20x)

In my opinion the lack of broad coverage by analysts and very conservative management have kept the true value of the company hidden.

Here’s a reason why management is conservative:

•	⁠They only expect 10% growth for 2021 (+$32m)
•	⁠Note that Microsoft deal alone would add +$28m (8%) based on the earnings call. I think this deal is a solid proof of the company’s performance, not only Microsoft extended the period (from 3 years to 4 years), they also expanded Perion’s service from 6 countries to 30+ countries.

•	⁠CTV is having $6m revenue last quarter, growing 130% from previous quarter. I wouldn’t be surprised if this segment alone would print $12-15m by Q4 2021 (pretty conservative estimate of the 100-150% growth YoY, note from 130% QoQ), or additional $20m for the whole year (+6%)

•	⁠Display and social advertising revenue increased by 159% YoY ($26m to $68m per quarter). I think the overall advertisement budget would continue to shift to social medias from traditional venues. Even a 10% YoY growth seems very conservative (additional $24m for the whole year, or 7% from total).

•	⁠Now even with the above conservative assumptions, we’re looking at 20% revenue growth. I think it would be easy for the company to achieve higher growth.

Keep a lookout on management’s forecast, Perion likes to announce before earnings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taking a covered call premium, reinvesting, back into underlying, and repeating Hypothetical:

 I buy 10,000 shares of a company's common stock. I then write 100 covered calls, using those shares. I make the strike high, so it's not likely they'll be ITM at expiration. I take the premium I make from selling the calls and I buy more shares. I then sell more calls on the new shares, and I repeat until I run out of money. There are diminishing returns with each iteration, but in one calculation, I found you could do it for about 3 or 4 rounds. 

Is there a specific name for this? I tried to Google it, but couldn't find much. 

Is this allowed, or legal? 

Are there any downsides to this? It seems like all the shares are still covered. 

I've done the math and in one instance, using some numbers at market close, it could increase the number of shares one could buy by about 30% for the same initial investment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why shouldn't I use this trading strategy.. It sounds too good to be true. So recently I've been looking at options and calculating profit on all sorts of hypothetical trades.

**The Scenario**
I buy a February 16th $401 long call for $3 per contract, with the underlying asset at $390, the stock per usual moves up to $391 or even $392 my hypothetical profits on 100 contracts would be $300 at $391, and $700 at $392 respectively. Please poke holes into this strategy it sounds too good to be true.

Update 2 (2/12)

In the United States, more than 10 investment companies have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for similar products. Last month, President Joe Biden appointed a new SEC chair, prompting hopes that a bitcoin ETF could be approved in 2021.

The OSC’s approval of BTCC could nudge other markets to see similar products come to light.

“The SEC will definitely feel the pressure to allow such a product to come to the marketplace because there are already products in the market that are taking advantage of the exposure of bitcoin that are not efficient for investors and are not being done in a regulated format like the SEC would want,” he said.

Bitcoin holdings are kept in “cold storage” – an offline custodian that cannot be hacked. Gemini Trust Company LLC will be sub-custodian for the fund, and CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Co. will act as fund administrator.

BTCC has a 1 per cent management fee, and will invest in the physical form of bitcoin rather than futures that would allow investors to speculate on the price at a later date. The fund will track the TradeBlock XBX Index, which uses an algorithm to calculate the consolidated price of bitcoin every second._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why i’m uncertain about Bitcoin As Bitcoin continues to surge and more big money is thrown at it, the more questions I have sitting on the sidelines.

The main question centres around this idea of crypto being a commodity - an asset described as digital gold. Yet while Gold is a material object which has been a store of value/currency for millennia, crypto is an idea hinged on being “the next currency”.

So my question is this: how is Bitcoin likely to replace FIAT currency when the underlying asset IS FIAT currency? In other words, if one day the dollar - for example - collapses, then so will Bitcoin..right? In times of hyperinflation, surely the more worthless Bitcoin becomes?

Am I missing something here.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NAT DD, Why I'm Invested long term Hey everyone. This is my bullish stance on NAT, do your own DD of course if you actually like the stock. At current price it is possible to see a 100% return within the next year.

Holding is 1,900 shares at $3.32 while picking up more when I am able.

What do they do you ask? Well they ship crude oil across the globe. They have one of the largest fleets out there with 23 Suezmax crude oil tankers and they are building two more to bring it to 25. The ships will be built by Samsung Heavy Industries and are set for delivery in 2022

While oil itself is slowly getting replaced by greener energies, this will not happen any time soon. Countries around the world, both developed and developing rely heavily on oil for the obvious gasoline as well as the millions of other goods made from oil. Even when electric cars become more mainstream it will take a while before the majority of people can afford them

They were able to weather the economic downturn very well and strengthened their capital structure by reducing their net debt by 22.40% from $350m to $272m during the first nine months of 2020. Even during some of the toughest times they were able to bring their debt down and still post strong revenue.

They have also attracted the attention of larger institutions as well. And yeah I do see this as great news.

1. BlackRock Inc. owns 8,721,613 shares and bought an additional 819,088 shares during the last quarter.
2. Wells Fargo & Company owns 2,455,198 shares and bought an additional 2,055,943 shares during the last quarter.
3. Arrowstreet Capital Limited Partnership owns 2,094,228 shares and bought an additional 1,261,572 shares during the last quarter.

5. JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns 263,513 shares of stock and bought an additional 63,771 shares during the last quarter.
