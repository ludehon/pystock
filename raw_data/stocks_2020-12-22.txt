 Clean Energy stocks Hi all, with the election going to the Democrats the green energy hype for 2021 has got me into stocks recently. I have started with some shares in BLNK, CLNE, ICLN, LTHM, MP and they all took off today specifically. Should this wave continue into the new year?

Big fan of the platform personally that you can get normal live tv channels and streaming in one for way less than you can a cable subscription.

Even after a massive run their market cap is only at $4B, with huge room to grow imo due to their growth numbers of monthly subscribers, the money they generate from ads that play on the platform as Fubo becomes more well known over the next few years.

They're also looking into sports betting which would be really cool as an interactive way of watching sports, and taking some market share for other sports gambling companies.

Their slogan is “healthy living for less”.

Over time they have been slowly growing and have around 356 stores and approximate they will continue to add around 20 stores each year (based on their last quarterly report). The CFO said that at a minimum they will continue with a “10% annual unit growth rate”. 

They are able to keep their costs low due to strategic distribution centres and they mostly self distribute their produce. They will be adding more distribution centres in 2021 to cut down costs even more and improve efficiency as they grow in scale.

Sprouts has had tremendous growth with an average revenue growth of 12.9% and net income growth of 16.2% per year for the last 5 years (including the last earnings report).  Their balance sheet looks good in terms of the grocery store business. One thing to mention when you look at their financial statements is that they had a sudden increase in long term leases and property planr and equipment (PP&E). This is due to a change in accounting policy and is nothing to worry about.

How has COVID-19 impacted Sprouts? First of all they have had more sales and CEO, Jack Sinclair said “. Our e-commerce business grew 337%, outpacing most e-commerce growth rates in the industry. We ended the quarter with e-commerce representing 11% of our sales. Our gross margin increased 400 basis points versus last year.”. However, the best part that COVID-19 has done to Sprouts is accelerate it’s 5-year goal of “creating a highly profitable, differentiated specialty grocer with a long growth runway”.  They have not had much of an emphasis on marketing, but have still accumulated a few millions of followers on social media. They have developed a strong brand that integrates sustainability with supporting farmers, their society, etc while offering lower prices on organic produce than any other grocer. 

With this strong brand proposition, they plan to expand their efforts on marketing since COVID-19 has accelerated their goal (mentioned above) and want to implement a loyalty program in the near future. Who doesn’t love more deals and saving money, right?

In addition to this, the CEO is relatively new (under 2 years) and has plenty of experience in the grocery sector with being an executive vice president of the U.S. Grocery Division of Walmart. 

With the current trend of wanting to be healthier and being “frugal” at the same time, this is another catalyst that differentiates Sprouts Farmer Markets from other grocery stores. 

Did I forget to mention that they brought in revenues of 6.231 billion and only have a market cap of 2.38 billion!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ stitch fix stock Hi everyone,

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on FB stock price So, FB got hit by the antitrust lawsuit from FTC, but GOOGL also got hit by one but GOOGL has been up since the lawsuit was filed.

Politics aside, it does not appear likely that the courts will create precedent that the government can undo mergers long after they have been approved by the FTC and completed.  I know FTC has undone mergers before but most of those are either not vetted by FTC previously or were vetted but were undone shortly thereafter (within a year or two, not like 5-6 years in the case of FB and Instagram).

Analyst sentiment seems positive.  $350 price targets are common.  Biggest growth driver is as the primary System of Engagement for SMID sized businesses, which is something that few social media companies can rival (e.g. Pinterest and Etsy's audience are much more limited, which is not necessarily a bad thing but does mean those will not be used by say a local restaurant or contractor company, etc.).  In that regard, it benefits from reopening while also doing well if we get lockdowns again.  P/E seems low around 30 for a growth stock (most others like it have P/E around 35-40 at least).

Going into January however I’d imagine things start going green again as people start off the year with their new short term prospects.

(Data from [https://www.stonks.fyi](https://www.stonks.fyi/))_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Deep Pharma Tech posts report on 5 High-Impact Technology Companies in Healthcare to Watch in 2021-2022 This article popped up in my Schwab feed and I found it to be an interesting read. Not sure on the credibility of the author but the research looks good. The breakdown of the partners and investors is particularly insightful. 

Here are their picks:
- NanoX
- Eargo
- Transmedics
- Silk Road
- Outset 

[Link to Report](https://www.deep-pharma.tech/high-impact-companies) 

I’m particularly bullish on NanoX and Outset. NanoX because I think their payment model has the potential to disrupt the medical imaging industry. It reduces the barrier to entry for emerging markets who don’t otherwise have access to imaging machines. I’ll be curious to see if there are any reports in 2021 on the preordered machines. It sounds like they had a successful demonstration at a recent convention but some industry leaders remain skeptical. The largest downside here in my opinion is the fact that the R&D lead listed on most of their patents doesn’t appear on other public documents as an employee of the company. There’s speculation around his employment status. With such cutting edge technology, losing a product lead can be crushing. 

Outset produces a portable home dialysis unit for kidney disease. I’m bullish here for a couple reasons. First, this is a rapidly growing area of healthcare. It’s such a drastic improvement for patient experience over coming into a clinic and it reduces costs for the healthcare provider. So win/win. Second, early research suggests COVID can lead to kidney disease ([John’s Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-kidney-damage-caused-by-covid19)) If that’s true, then the demand for their product is going to skyrocket over the next few years.

What techniques/strategies do I want to study? What outlets for news and education do I want to pay attention to? Please point me in the right direction!**

I've recently been diving into my market education after deciding that I'd like to supplement my monthly income with short term trades -- specifically swing plays. I have no prior formal financial education of the stock market, so I'm learning in a "hodge-podge" fashion. Definitely not interested in subscribing to any gurus or club plans, either.   

That being said, I've been paying my closest attention to technical analysis and confirmation/exit strategies. Instead of trading paper money accounts, I'd like to carefully enter real positions in a "sink or swim" approach (I also happen to use TDA ThinkorSwim). I recently started looking into options trading, and ways to regularly supplement my income through strategies surrounding options.  Been finding and reading about a few attractive strategies. I'm very interested in quick, regular, *relatively* low-risk plays to start building my portfolio and capital to make more significant plays. My risk tolerance is pretty high overall, though. Once I get it down pat, I'd like to start selling covered calls that expire worthless so I can keep the premium. Knowing this, are there any other similar entry-level strategies you all would recommend to a new trader looking to gradually build capital?   

Likewise, are there any other strategies and techniques I should be paying attention to? Furthermore, aside from educational channels and lectures on YouTube, are there any other resources (news outlets, podcasts, social media pages, etc.) that you all find value in? Are there any breakout stocks you recommend looking into? Once I have the knowledge, how should I go about finding markets to apply the knowledge?

A stimulus deal has finally been agreed on! CarMax Reports earnings before the bell. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a very bad open after the UK [news](https://ibb.co/gRtBKsQ), but things did turn around as the big 3 indexes mostly recovered, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PrY0RJx) finishing down just 0.10% for the day, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/8gTGLps) even posting a small gain finishing up 0.12% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/tppPJ2r) lost 0.39% dragged down by the recent addition, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/dB2pbc2), which finished more than 6% down for the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0GHcjF4) opening very high and was up more than 30% at one point before eventually finishing the day around the 25 levels, as the new strain in the UK caused some panic selling and overreactions in the stock market in my opinion. [Here](https://streamable.com/832r8c) is a short-clip from the Admiral Brett Giroir, the US HHS assistant secretary sharing the facts on CNN yesterday, as there is a lot of misinformation going on.

So, he gave us reassurance, and I don’t believe there is anything to dispute [here](https://ibb.co/8XmJ4PL), as I have done a lot of research yesterday on the matter, as this strain has been circulating for 3 months already and is not something new with the only point of concern being that this one is more transmissible and has become the most common in the UK. This should not impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and has not been proven to be more lethal than any other strain. So, hopefully the vaccines become more available as fast as possible so that we can get past this whole thing already.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/8N8qSgR) more than 60% of the companies were losing ground on above average volume, as companies have started to have some retracements to the 50-day moving averages. Only one of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/z6P1DDX) in the SP was gaining yesterday, with Financials gaining 0.81%, while Energy, Real Estate and Utilities finished the day down more than 2% as growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/RgBp7cP), especially the mid and small-caps.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ncyyDVm) from yesterday, as there was a whole lot of red going on, with only the biggest tech companies in the world having some small gains, with Microsoft & Apple up more than 1% while Amazon & Google also finished barely up for the day. We Also got the US banks which did pretty good following the FED decision to allow share buybacks again and Nike also surging after terrific earnings. We also saw some of the biggest losers in the oil & gas industry joined by Tesla which saw a significant pullback after the SP500 inclusion.

Meanwhile, the US Congress finally [passed](https://ibb.co/4f0zbdv) a $892B bill after many months of gridlock that is expected to be signed into law by Trump. The bill will include $600 payments to most American. The bill which is more than 5K pages long also includes a federal spending budget of over $1.4T and has a net cost of only $350B in relief spending with the rest coming from unspent money from the previous bill.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3dcfyNc) are the most interesting economic reports coming today, with the GDP revision, consumer confidence index and home sales coming early in the morning.

We also get a single big earnings report today, coming from [CarMax](https://ibb.co/k4vtbFp) which will show us how the second-hand car market is doing, this may impact other stocks like Carvana and even car manufacturers. So, will writing this, CarMax released the [earnings](https://ibb.co/Z2r0qBy) and delivered a beat on the top and bottom line but underwhelmed on comparable store sales which were down 0.8% vs the 4.1% increase expected. I will come back tomorrow and discuss more about this after I get into the earnings report more in-depth.

In some other stock market news, [GM](https://ibb.co/dMJrMQd) has landed 10K pre-orders for the new Hummer EV for the Edition 1 model which will be listed well above the $100K mark and will start production next year, this is another manufacturer that is going to keep putting more and more pressure on Tesla’s EV market share.

Tesla also continued to drop yesterday after [reports](https://ibb.co/sgvtSh3) that Apple is moving forward with a self-driving car by 2024 that would include its own breakthrough battery technology. Apple has started this project in 2014 but this had low interest from the company in the past years, has recently been brought back into focus, as they are targeting a unique mono-cell battery design that could radically reduce the cost and increase the range of the vehicle. Though I believe this is very unlikely to happen, as Apple is more likely to license this kind of technology, or maybe they will try to rely on some kind of a manufacturing partner rather than start manufacturing their own cars

We also saw the whole solar energy stock rallying again after reports that the spending bill will [include](https://ibb.co/N2q4RWp) $35B in energy R&D programs, with an extension of the Tax Credit for solar & wind power.

While another stay-at-home winner, [Peloton](https://ibb.co/dbhH7xQ) just agreed to acquire Precor for $420M as they seek to expand the market share and the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with the big demand which has caused delays.

Another recent stock market favorite also received a one-year $114M option contract from the US army. This helped pushed [Palantir](https://ibb.co/q0dgSkK) almost 10% up in regular trading and more than 2% again in after-hours.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/02kV0jF) seem to be mixed right now, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, as the stay-at-home stocks are back in flavour alongisde this new virus strain, but who knows how long this will last...

Analysis / DD Goldman Sachs have previously given a strong buy signal for Kahoot!, raising it's value by up to 30% from what it was at the time (December 14th), and they have almost reached this already. The biggest bank in Norway jumped on the same train claiming the same as Goldman Sachs, and more analytics are seeing a probability of a 200% increase in 2021.

This Monday, Softbank bought more stocks in Kahoot! to become the biggest shareholder in the company. Analytics are saying this should open doors into the asian market, as Softbank is huge there.

The company, like TikTok, has its content User Created, and use close to zero money on marketing - yet still had over 1 billion users in 2018.

Since 2019 they have grown alot..

* Bought Poio - a learning to read app for children - (Poio.com)
* Bought Dragonbox - a math-teaching app for children - (Dragonbox.com)
* Bought Actimo - Company for developing the businessmodel of Kahoot!
* Bought Drops - a language teaching app - (Languagedrops.com)
* Microsoft, Disney and Softbank shareholders
* in 2018 it had over 1 billion users in over 200 countries
* Just recently started converting businesses / Schools over to premium subscriptions
* Planning its IPO over to the Oslo Stock Exchange in Q1 2021 (Currently on Euronext Growth)
* Integrated in MS Teams and Zoom
* I assume Kahoot are gathering alot of information about teaching through all these platforms
* Probably more that I've missed

&#x200B;

Some call it the Spotify of Norway - and that it's most likely going all the way to Nasdaq. Its biggest userbase is in the US, and I assume Microsoft, Disney and Softbank open alot of doors for Kahoot.

Currently priced at 90 NOK (\~10 usd) per share, valued at \~4,5b usd, it's been increasing rapidly the last few days, and continue to increase.

&#x200B;

With the diversity of Kahoot, and the seriousness of its focus on learning, I see this as a very safe longterm investment, and the numbers they presented for Q3 were very positive. Luckily I got in quite early here, and I still think it's a big company in an early growth phase. For me this is a 5-10 year investment.

aggresviely pay off any debt you may have, your return from this will certainlty be better off than what you will get from public markts, invest in your own education or your family members. Use the money to advance aspects of your career.

here goes

I am totally aghast at peoples holdings, the chances of you making a long term gain on companies like snowflake or tesla are zero. These are not casino stocks because there are few in a casino who might make money in the long run. Paying $600,000 dollars per telsa ever sold is insane. Paying 100 times sales for snowflake is suicide. The only way you would make money is if you held the onver 40 years and had happened to pick the next walmart or apple. american equity indexes will be flat over 10 years. growth stock will be lower than flat.

But somethign like ARK innovation which has bundled the most speculative companies will become the poster child for this climate. Almost all of the return of these etfs is just multiple expansion, thats it.

People pointing to these recent stock success of these companies  is like using a plane as an example of why gravity does not exist.

Palantir for example is trading at similair PS multiples like Akamai in 2000 the stock is still 68% down. 99% of the stocks you know im talking about will do incredibly poorly.

there will be an amazon style winner in their somewhere.

you wont hold it for the length of time youll need to to make a return.

My guess is the extreme specualtion will carry on for a while yet, low interest rates and psychology will push this higher for now.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think especially hydrogen and the longtime investment on it is the best what you can do (5-20years) Hey there lovely community it's me back again,

In the last days, weeks, and months there is an insane run on renewables and it feels definitely promising. 
Let me introduce myself first I work on state level for upcoming renewables and the last months i was part and had a insight of several upcoming hydrogen projects and national/international strategies. 
We have to change our mindset about energy or our planet will change longtime so there is no Plan B even the cost are now significant for the upcoming infrastructure whether its Electric or any other renewable energy Form. Oil company's will look out for new ways to stay in the market (e. G. Shell hydrogen report) helping building infrastructure. 
If you're looking for really really fast money maybe you should not pick hydrogen or just dip in several times and cash out... in your portfolio bc the technology is like on 10% from 100%. There is plenty of room left for research (saltwater electrolysis, better materials lest costs, stack development etc). It will definitely need time but it's really promising. There are 3 concepts for 2050 one is electric based on hydrogen based and one is more a "realistic" one. Whatever happens you should definitely not get your whole portfolio in hydrogen that is not what I want to say but  whatever comes even nuclear back with the newest researches hydrogen is always a way to go. With all the upcoming volatile energy you need storage solutions. And there comes the problem. There are 2 systems ETES from siemens gamesa and Hydrogen who can hold energy at least 1 week (hydrogen under certain circumstances will hold longer). Chemical solutions are 1. Pretty expensive 2. Hold less energy 3. Are scaling huge in terms of size with the amount of energy you want to store. (like upcoming redox flow batteries). Only the industry needs  most of the time storages for nighttimes but normal households and infrastructure who doesn't work in night times needs most of their energy especially in winter days or when renewables are off. Current state is hydrogen is only useful at the coast with high volatile windpower offshore and the projects with hydrogen are mostly stupid when it comes to cost accounting for a company. Even with 50-80% state funding. But several years it was the same problem with solar power. Solarpanels were too expensive 20years they needed to hold at least to make the cost evaluation +- 0 but now as technology is getting better and better you just need 5 years now and then you're in plus. I could now point out several links and informations about how great everything is and will be but that's too much so maybe just ask your questions directly especially when it comes to the low effiency or reconversion if you scared of these topics and why you think it's inefficient against other technologies.

Private clinics are now dealing with as many as 2,500 patients. Meanwhile, less than 5 patients receive unlicensed cannabis medicines through NHS New Government figures show a 900% increase in the number of cannabis medicines notified for import demonstrating the private sector’s growing role in fulfilling UK demand.

At the end of the last trading period, Medicenna Therapeutics closed at $3.84.”

Medicenna is developing a pipeline of next-generation cytokines that are designed to be safer and more efficacious than Proleukin, as well as many competing new IL-2 variants, Biegler tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes the company's lead product, MDNA11, which is slated to enter the clinic in mid-2021, has a" best-in-class" preclinical profile. 

It’s important to note that the target stock price does not include MDNA 55. The stock price still undervalues MDNA 55 while assigning virtually no value to the early stage compounds and preclinical assets. It’s like you get a flyer on future developments for free while MDNA 55 provides significant downside protection.

I’ve seen a lot of discussion about these two specific ETF funds and I like the idea of having a portfolio that isn’t super up and down. I’ve been looking into investing into either ARKG or ARKK (yes I know getting both is an option) and my current portfolio consists of RCEY, Nio, CRSR, SPCE, APHA, UXIN.

I find it extremely easy to use, but since I haven’t use any other app for trading I wanted to see which would be the major drawbacks on Revolut. Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Triple Income Strategy  Alright if you’re unfamiliar with the Triple Income Strategy, here it is. 

&#x200B;

This is not some trick to get quick profits. This is an amazing method to earn $ on shares you don’t own, and get paid dividends on shares you do own. You must do this with a stock you want to own. This is not a great strategy if you don’t want to own the shares for at least a month. 

&#x200B;

I have talked about this before, the Triple Income Strategy. 

&#x200B;

Scenario 1 - Find a stock you would like to own. You will then sell cash covered puts on it. You collect the $ from selling puts, they expire worthless, you keep the $ and profited from doing nothing. 

&#x200B;

Scenario 2 - you sell puts, get assigned when the stock falls to that level, and you get 100 shares for the price you chose. Now, the fun happens. You can start selling covered calls. Sell strikes that are higher than what you paid. 

&#x200B;

Once assigned, you will have profited from the premium of the put selling, the premium of the call selling, and the increase in price from what you bought it at vs what you sold it at. This is proven to pay more $ than owning dividend stocks. 

&#x200B;

Okay, you want to add BLNK to your long term portfolio but you think $37 is too high and you can get a better price. So how do you get a lower price? Bid. Selling a put is a way of bidding. If BLNK hits $33 by next Friday, we will buy 100 shares for $33. We got paid $115 for selling the put, so really our BLNK shares have a total price of $31.85 each, which is our break even price. 

&#x200B;

Instead of just buying the shares from the beginning, you will sell puts until you get assigned. Each time you sell a put and then close it for profit, you are earning $ off of the stock. If you sell 1 put for 1.00 a week for a month, you will profit $400 that month from selling puts. Now if you get assigned on the 5th week at $33, you actually only paid $29 because you already profited $400. 

\-

Once you own the shares you can either keep them long term and sell far OTM calls and only collect a small amount of money, or you can be aggressive and sell the next strike up. If you paid $33 for your shares, you would want to sell at least a $34 call. 

&#x200B;

This will let you profit from selling the call (calls are about $250) and the increase from your purchase price of $33 to your selling price of $34, which is $100. 

&#x200B;

In total, you made $115 from selling the put, $250 from selling the call, and $100 from the shares increasing in price. This gives you a total profit of $465 just from owning 100 shares of a stock that moved $1._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ No market crash anytime sooner - "Coronavirus vaccine will still protect against new U.K. variant, says WHO" >"The U.K. has informed us that they don’t believe that there’s an impact on the vaccine.

Does this mean that as long as the current strike price doesn't go below $10, I'll profit (As in $10.01?).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

You probably recognize the Precor brand name if you've ever spent time in a hotel or standalone commercial gym, which is exactly why Peloton making this purchase makes a ton of sense at this particular time for the hot home-workout brand.

The Precor acquisition will be made via a deal that's valued at a total of $420 million, and in addition to expanding its commercial business, this also helps Peloton bring on a lot more manufacturing capability in a time when its order queue for its Tread and Bike hardware is deeper than ever, thanks to the increase in demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Precor already maintains a significant U.S.-based manufacturing operation, as well as dedicated research and development teams and facilities. In total, Peloton says in a press release that it'll be adding 625,000 square feet of manufacturing facility in the U.S., between Precor facilities in both Whitsett, North Carolina and Woodinville, Washington.

While the near-term use of the acquisition, which is set to close in 2021 if it meets all approvals, is to speed up delivery times for customers of existing equipment, long-term this deal sets Peloton up nicely for greater commercial market expansion -- once the commercial market returns to growth. While the pandemic has been a clear boon for Peloton's at-home equipment and fitness subscription service, it's also been devastating for gym chains and hoteliers, meaning that it's likely Precor's primary business was taking a considerable hit over the past few months.

This is the largest deal that Peloton has made thus far, but it's possible it picked up Precor for a relative bargain; Precor owner Anta Sports was said to have been seeking a potential sale of the company for around $500 million last November. Peloton will be installing Precor President Rob Barker as GM of Peloton Commercial as part of the new deal, and that should help it accelerate the infiltration of its connected equipment in commercial gyms globally once people feel more comfortable about returning to them safely post-pandemic.

I may lose some money but i establish a position at lower price point, which I am fine with. If it increases then i sell a longer call like an year in future. and if it increases again, i bite the bullet and buy my calls back when i feel comfortable. Definitely I lose some money because of calls/puts but I establish a position with some gains. It definitely has issues if stock runs too much in short time frame.
