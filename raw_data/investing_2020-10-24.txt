This post is just for discussion about this specific antitrust concern, and not whether there are broader concerns about any as-yet unfiled antitrust suit against Apple.

As an AAPL investor, should I be concerned that the Google antitrust lawsuit seems to focus primarily on the $8B Google pays Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones? $8B is no joke. And if Google is legally barred from paying for placement as an outcome of this case, the value of  default search placement on Apple products would go to nearly zero due to the resulting lack of competition for that placement._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any thoughts on Intel (INTC) Thinking about buying some shares of intel this week and capitalize on the rebound.

Hello,

I am wondering if there are any public companies, or funds through which I could get exposure to energy storage. I dont mean battery producers, but things like pumped hydroelectric or other such large scale, low cost storage options.

I was looking at Highview Power, Form Energy, Antora Energy, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, but its all private.

After reading through and watching gobs of information on calculating the "intrinsic value" of a business/stock, I have become disillusioned. I am sure this is what has made Buffett very unique because it must be quite difficult to find a company that is undervalued according to his rules, however not impossible.

I have painstakingly looked through about 50 different tickers to see if they can meet the "undervalued" criteria to my best understanding. These have all been, for the most part, well known and established tickers. A lot of them are on the Dividend Aristocrat list. After plugging in all the numbers several were "undervalued" according to their intrinsic value, however, after charting the last 10 years of EPS, Book value, etc. the charts show inconsistencies which supposedly mean that the intrinsic value doesn't apply. This is because they have not shown steady and predictable growth. I **found one** that matched but then Schwab and Morningstar both rated it poorly and suggest selling.

**So does Buffett advice still hold true?** I believe it does, however with the unprecedented market fluctuations over the last 10 years, most companies have seen turbulence.

Overseas borrowers have flocked to the dollar this year at a record pace, with sovereigns from Indonesia to Colombia and companies from Nissan Motor Co. to Manila’s water utility racking up sales of $1.29 trillion.

It’s a key economic takeaway from the Covid-19 crisis: just as happened in the wake of the global financial meltdown of 2008, the dollar is cementing its role as the world’s dominant currency even as unilateralist policies from President Donald Trump rile allies and rivals alike.


“Whenever there is a crisis, companies and countries rush to make sure they have all the funding they need,” said Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist who coined the BRIC acronym.

“The dollar markets are the only real source available, so the whole situation builds on itself,” according to O’Neill, who is chair of the international policy group Chatham House.

The ease of borrowing in dollars across the globe has been key in preventing the health and economic crisis spiraling into a financial one by providing companies and governments cheap access to funds. But it may also be sowing seeds for the next crisis: If the greenback sees a sustained appreciation trend, it will drive up debt-servicing costs, potentially creating, for some, repayment difficulties down the road.

Everybody Loves Dollars

That’s a particular risk for emerging markets, where external debt including dollar borrowing is climbing at the fastest pace on record, with full-year issuance on track to eclipse $750 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Damian Sassower.

For now, the dollar’s been moving in the right direction. The Bloomberg dollar index has plunged about 10.5% from its 2020 high reached on March 23.

A lack of global alternatives helps explain some of the dollar’s role. The euro’s status as a reserve currency remains limited, and China’s currency is still subject to capital controls.


It’s also a function of cost. With the Federal Reserve unleashing massive liquidity, and now expected to keep interest rates near zero for years to come, the greenback is all the more attractive as a funding source.

U.S. Treasury yields fell to record lows as Fed cut rates, added stimulus
Easier Fed policy helped the Philippines sell sovereign dollar debt at its lowest interest rate ever back in April. The dollar is the “universal currency” and the unit of global trade, according to Rosalia de Leon, treasurer of the Philippines, who says her country will continue to rely on the greenback to help fund its budget deficit.

Philippine and Indonesian companies have each sold more dollar bonds in 2020 than in any past full year.


“The domestic financial market is not yet deep” in Indonesia, said Deni Ridwan, director of sovereign bonds at the nation’s Finance Ministry. By selling debt in dollars, Indonesia’s government can avoid crowding out local rupiah issuers, he explained.

For Nissan, the Japanese carmaker struggling to bounce back from both corporate scandals and the Covid crisis, the broad base of international investors was appealing when it turned to the dollar debt market for the first time in decades. It priced an $8 billion dollar offering in September, one of the largest corporate issues in Asia on record, as well as a 2 billion euro deal ($2.4 billion).

The total issuance of $1.29 trillion from non-U.S. borrowers this year is up 21% from the same period of 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


The record boom in offshore dollar bond sales has been echoed on the U.S. domestic front. Behind it all: the Fed not only cut its policy rate near zero in March, it introduced corporate-debt purchase programs that helped ensure the flow of credit even as coronavirus lockdowns walloped the economy.

The Fed also enlarged and expanded swap lines with monetary authorities around the world to address a sudden shortage of dollars abroad.

Fed provision of dollars to other central banks soared in 2020
The critical role of the U.S. currency also has a downside, however -- it leaves emerging markets reliant on American policy settings. While it seems distant now, Fed tightening down the road could spur dollar appreciation.


“The extensive dependence on the dollar leaves the international financial system hostage to the whims of U.S. policies, especially those of the Federal Reserve,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team, and is now at Cornell University. “For emerging market economies, in particular, it can create whiplash effects on capital flows and exchange rates.”

While other major bond markets are seeing a bumper year too -- Europe’s primary bond market has surpassed 1.5 trillion euros of annual sales for the first time -- when issuers do go offshore to borrow, it’s still likely to be in dollars.

Even as the share of dollar funding relative to the size of the global economy remains below its peak of a decade ago, its slice of international borrowing has climbed to a two-decade high, Bank for International Settlements data show. “It is clearly the dominant international funding currency,” the BIS wrote in a June report._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

It does show signs of age when David Harper gives specific examples of biotechs. In one case he mentions Nexia Biotechnologies which went bankrupt almost 10 years ago. Although there was a lot of hype around the company's product; using [genetically engineered goats](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/spider-goats-display-angers-ottawa-professor-1.1137229) to manufacture BioSteel. Sounds revolutionary and high tech, which makes it a good cautionary tale. It's easy to get hyped about the products but that doesn't mean it's economically viable.

The book did have some timeless advice though. I've made a list of some points to consider when researching a biotech:

1.The goals of each clinical trial:

Preclinical: Animal testing

Phase 1: Is it safe?

Phase 2: Does it work?

Phase 4: Is it safe and does it work for a lot of people?

2.Be wary if the FDA is questioning the statistics of a trial. It's a possible sign the company will have to redo it. This is costly and time consuming.  

3. Alliances are key. Are they partnering with large, well known pharmaceutical companies?

4. Look for venture capital and IB backing. They have a team of experts so if they endorse it, it's a good sign. It's also a very positive sign if the investment bank buys shares directly in the company. Alternatively, be cautious if the biotech is raising capital alone, in which case you have to question why no one is interested. 

5. Look at the background of management, do they have a proven track record of regulatory approval?

6. Burn rate: how fast a biotech consumes capital. Ideally, they should have 2-3 years' worth of cash on hand based on their burn rate. Companies with more cash are less likely to try to raise capital by diluting shareholders. 

7. Be skeptical of phase 3 trials with less than 500 participants. Ignore results when there are less than 100 participants. 

8. 40% rule.

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks. Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources, renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE: It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings. This ETF tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings: SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

QCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies. For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **32.34%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**
* Semiconductors - **13.18%**
* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**
* Electrical Components & Equipment - **6.97%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**
* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**
* Construction Supplies & Fixtures - **2.45%**
* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**

Top 10 Holdings: NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)**

# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:

PBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **44.46%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**
* Semiconductors - **7.36%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**
* Construction & Engineering - **4.47%**
* Industrial Machinery & Equipment - **3.97%**
* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.76%**

Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!

Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance. 

Edit 2: One User reccomended CNRG, it is similar to PBW with slightly different weighting and more expose to Renewable Energy Equipment and Services. Definitely worth a closer look and consideration!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Moving from Robo advisor to DIY Hi All!

I recently took a move from my Robo Advisor to my own IBKR account.

My previous portfolio suggested by the Robo included VTI, BNDX, BND, IEMG.

I did read a bunch of information online and I’m still quite torn on what to get as my simple portfolio for mid term investment (5-10 years).

It appears that 80% VWRA and 20% IGLA is quite popular recently, but at the same time, recent posts here suggest that VTI and VOO are good to get for Nice gains.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions on Municipal Bonds? I'm at a point in my life / career where I have acquired a fair amount of wealth. I'm in a higher tax bracket and reside in California. I normally keep the majority of my stocks in tech and more speculative stocks and I'm looking to diversify some at this point.

My personal opinion is that I believe the stock market is now slightly overvalued and I've read a few articles that speculate the same. I know all the stimulus talks are keeping it afloat, but it still feel it's a bit high.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble)

However, despite me believing it is slightly overvalued I'm not very keen on pulling out of my current holdings. I think they are all strong for 5-10 years.  I would rather move for a brief make any new investments into something more stable (bonds). It seems to me that Municipal Bonds are more effective than other options (Treasury, Corporate, TIPs, etc) because they somewhat uniquely provide a good combination of

* Not likely to default
* Tax efficient (federal and state)
* Solid yields

I also read this article discussing some of the risks and benefits and helps explain how they help punch above their weight as you get into the higher tax brackets. I also thought it was interesting that they recommended diversifying state municipals during the pandemic in case of a risk of a State defaulting

**Questions**

1. Should I worry about diversifying states in municipal bonds, or should I go all in California to take full advantage of State tax exemptions?
2. Does anyone have any other strong considerations / worries about municipal bonds?
3. Or should I focus on something else?

I'm not interested in actively hunting / looking for the best municipal bonds - I likely would pick one of these 3 ETFs

* MUB (Diversified with .07% expense)
* VTEB (Diversified with .06% expense)
* CMF (California focused with .25% expense)
