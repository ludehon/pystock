I do invest in stocks and other assets but i invest in my local currency. So if i buy a house for 100k and in 3 years its now worth 109,272 thats a 3% gain every year for 3 years, but if my countries inflation rate is also 3% a year i havent really made any gains. So i was wondering. What are some ways that i can take my cash and where i can invest it in order to defend myself from inflation.

&#x200B;

I know that question is too open so ill shorten it to this, 

In order to protect myself from 3% inflation a year, can i just buy other currencies that out perform my inflation?

&#x200B;

example: I have 100k dollars, which has a 3% inflation a year, so i buy as many euros as i can which outperforms the dollar by 5% a year, so ill be making 2% gains a year. Is the logic behind this investment correct? And can i buy other currencies in order to protect my local currency?

Thank you :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys think about Suncor Energy ($SU)? I personally really like this stock for a few reasons:

1. They have a "moat". Something that keeps potential competition from popping up. Since they're in the energy business, large amounts of capital are required to start a business like this. 

2. They are expanding into renewable energies. Renewable energy is sort of speculative right now, but it's a good way to cover your bases in case oil becomes less consumed over time. 

3. They are not highly leveraged. Their debt to equity ratio is way lower (below 0.5) than any other energy company and they don't seem to be sacrificing large potential gains by not being so leveraged. 

4. They are trading below book value as of now. While the current stock price per share is currently around $12, the book value per share is a little over $17 per share. 

5. Despite not being highly leveraged, they still manage to pay dividends to shareholders (currently 5.47%). 

There are some other reasons why I like this stock, but I wanted to see what other people have to say about it. I ended up buying at around $12/share so I might be a little biased on my reasons for liking it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone else us margin accounts to increase leverage/gains for investments? Investor here. I'm considering taking more risk via margin since the markets look like they will be going up for the near future 2-5 range. Considering transferring my account to M1 finance or IB who have very low margin rates and using that margin equity to invest.

It looks pretty much like free money to me when it costs 1.5-2% for interest. It's true that a risk adverse investor probably won't use margin debt above 25-50% of equity, but it's still pretty much free money. IMO the risk to reward of making a margin investment into quality stock seems much lower than yoloing your money on TSLA options. Especially when a lot of good value stocks are paying well above 5% and growth stocks I've owned are up like +50%.

**Initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week**

New US jobless claims fell to the lowest level since early March last week but remained elevated above 700,000, as the Trump administration and Democrats remained at odds over a broad package of economic aid under two weeks before the presidential election.

Initial applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 787,000, compared with 842,000 in the prior week, the US labour department said on Thursday. The figure was lower than economists’ forecast of 860,000 claims.

The federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programme, which offers benefits to the self-employed and others who would not qualify for regular benefits, registered 345,440 new claims on an unadjusted basis, up from 337,228.

The number of Americans actively collecting state jobless aid totalled 8.4m in the week that ended on October 10. That continued a positive trend in continuing claims, having dropped from 9.4m in one week and from 12.7m in the span of one month. However, economists have partly attributed the fall to unemployed workers exhausting regular benefits.

The insured unemployment rate, considered an alternative measure of joblessness, dropped to 5.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent.

Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, have continued stimulus negotiations into this week in a last-ditch attempt to hammer out an agreement before the poll.

Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday he was “optimistic” about the talks. “We do share one goal, and that is hopefully to get some kind of deal in the next 48 hours or so,” he told Fox Business. He added that funding for state and local governments was the biggest sticking point.

As coronavirus outbreaks in America’s south and west this summer faded, hopes for a steadier recovery in the labour market rose after big states including Florida and Texas loosened curbs on businesses.

But health officials have warned that other regions, particularly the Midwest, could be at risk of outbreaks. Wisconsin, where the rate of positive tests has hit highs this month, has emerged as a new virus hotspot. The north-east states of New Jersey and Connecticut have also reported a rise in infections after quelling earlier outbreaks.

Federal Reserve officials have warned that the economy’s rebound could sputter without further stimulus from Washington. Republicans in the Senate put forward another $500bn bill this week that would increase unemployment aid, among other measures, but it was blocked by Democrats before reaching a vote. Donald Trump has said he would support a bigger spending plan, while House Democrats have backed a $2.2tn proposal.

The jobless claims report showed that 23.2m people were claiming benefits in all state and federal programmes as of October 3, down from 24.2m, according to unadjusted figures that are reported on a two-week delay.

The US has recovered half of the 22m jobs lost in March and April, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7.9 per cent in September — below its pandemic-era peak of 14.7 per cent._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in Solar As far as I can tell.

I watching the video about it and read through the information but am still having a hard time understanding the negatives vs positives. Here are two of the downsides that Ally lists:

* You relinquish voting rights on your securities while they’re on loan. 
* You’ll receive a substitute payment of cash instead of your regular dividend payment if your security is on loan. This may result in a higher tax consequence for that security because dividend income is taxed at a different rate.

Dominos had a good earnings report but as the norm lately fell AH. Tomorrow is a magically day. Domino's has a 100 Day Support level at $387 and the stock is very close at $389. My prediction is that it will decline slightly tomorrow and bounce off that support.

Buy Calls and/or Shares anywhere between $387 - $389 tomorrow. I would buy calls in Dec or Jan to give it time to recover. I see it popping in the next week or two to at least $400+ again.

Domino's Pizza ([**DPZ**](https://www.etrade.wallst.com/v1/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=DPZ) \-7%) must be feeling a bit like a burnt crust with its stock down today despite reporting nice upside for Q3 with good comps. However, we see some chinks in the armor with this report that make the stock action more understandable.

So why is the stock lower despite reporting upside?

Investor expectations were running quite high heading into this report after the stock ran from $280 in mid-March to $431 yesterday. The $0.07 beat is not as robust as recent quarters. Coming into this quarter, DPZ reported double-digit EPS beats in five of the past six quarters, including huge $0.70+ beats in Q1 and Q2. Initially, analysts clearly underestimated the beneficial impact from the pandemic on DPZ's business, but this more modest upside tells us that analyst models have gotten more realistic. Same store comps were quite good at +17.5% in the US and +6.2% internationally, which was a nice sequential improvement from Q2 (+16.1%, +1.3%). However, we think strong comps were already baked in thanks to upbeat language from DPZ last quarter. DPZ said in July that accelerated levels of demand from the middle of Q2 remained elevated through the end of the quarter. The company's main rival, Papa John's (PZZA), recently reported Q3 comps of +23.8% for North America and +20.6% for international restaurants, both of which are significantly higher than DPZ's comps.

Overall, DPZ's earnings and comps were quite strong and the pullback in the stock today does nothing to diminish them. DPZ's business is booming as people are increasingly eating at home and looking for a quick and cheap meal. The problem is more that DPZ is a victim of its own success since the company was facing very high investor expectations with this report. Perhaps the silver lining here is that analyst models have now captured the pandemic tailwind. As a result, investors are less likely to have sky-high expectations heading into DPZ's Q4 report. So, next time a $0.70 beat will not be needed to drive the stock higher._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Exxon Mobil to lay off employees citing tough markets, reorganization Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to lay off an unspecified number of employees as low oil prices force the company to delay major projects, the company said in an email to staff.

“These are difficult times,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in the message, the text of which was released by the company Wednesday. “We are making tough decisions, some of which will result in friends and colleagues leaving the company.”

The oil behemoth’s job cut is just the latest sign of struggle among U.S. energy producers seeking to weather the industry’s worst downturn in recent memory. Just this week two high-profile mergers were announced as explorers seek to gain scale and cut costs to survive the devastating impact of COVID-19 on global demand for fuel.

Exxon’s stock has plunged and the company has all but ended its aggressive, US$30 billion-a-year counter-cyclical growth strategy. The company was forced to slash its capital spending budget by a third, or US$10 billion, earlier this year. Rivals such as BP Plc and Chevron Corp. have also announced large layoffs in recent weeks.

“Our plan is to continue to stage project execution and spending,” Woods said. “Making the organization more efficient and more nimble will reduce the number of required positions and, unfortunately, reduce the number of people we need.”

Exxon’s stock has plunged 52 per cent this year and briefly lost its long-held crown as America’s top oil and gas producer to Chevron Corp. Its dividend yield stands at more than 10 per cent suggesting that investors believe it may be cut for the first time in at least four decades.
