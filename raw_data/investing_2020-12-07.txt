Prop1: The general thesis is that we are headed into a commodity supercycle as Western world governments reinvest in infrastructure to tackle climate change and quickly employ people displaced by the pandemic and pre-pandemic knowledge economy.

Prop 2:  From (1) Yellen will depreciate the USD to support the local US economy.

Prop 3: From (1) Countries like China, US, EY need  small modular reactor (SMR) \[1\] \[2\] to provide stable electricity when there is no Sun or wind.  Countries like India need SMR to replace oil imports, if they want to adhere to the Paris Climate Accord without risking stagflation. 

Even Japan is restarting some reactors.  Japan must restart many more nuclear reactors to meet the Paris Climate Accord and the 2050 goal.  

In fact all countries need SMR  to meet their 2050 for them to meet the PCR because Wind and Solar is insufficient to give them a stable electricity output AND meet the future demand for EVs.

From (2) and (3), Uranium prices will climb as nuclear energy will be considered and marketed as a renewable energy.  ie Green nuclear.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk on uranium.

My understanding of the long-term probability of profitability would eventually be a taxi fleet through self-driving cars but the likelihood that this would lower costs by not employing drivers is now a dream. 

Renting or purchasing self-driving vehicles for use will carry its own cost once self-driving cars become more of a reality and I don't see Uber as a viable company in the medium term. The sustainability of hiring drivers is low given the higher probability of regulatory pressure going forward. California was the first step and even though it failed, regulatory pressure will continue to mount for Uber and Lyft.

Somehow the market keeps going up and even though every parameter screams something's fishy the shorts keep losing money. People have been talking about and index-fund bubble to years and perhaps this is the time we will see some strange things happen with TSLA.

So, I am not invested in TSLA, I am not shorting it and I am not touching the stock - but here is a scenario that might play out and I'd like to hear your opinion.

TSLA has mooned and keeps mooning. Valuation? Who cares. What I think might be the thing here, just like it was with the rating companies in the previous mentioned movie is that wall street will dump their shares on investors who can't really do much to stop it. How? They collaborate with S&P to get the stock included in the index and that forces the price to go even higher. During this time they can just keep dumping their shares into the average Joe's pension fund. When they are done dumping their shares the bubble will pop and left are the common folks who will pay the bill with lower pensions. Perhaps this is how index investing dies.

Idk, just a theory of mine. People thought the rating agencies never would be in bed with wall street during the great recession - but they were. Not saying it's like that now though. Just thought it would be a brilliant plan, even if it's "evil".

I am in between FOMO and "just buy good and hold" - I personally feel like a correction will happen.

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response.

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

And, what are your thoughts on oil in the short term as people return back to work/travel, coupled with potential supply constraints coming from the shale patch?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uranium, a great investment opportunity (talking exit strategy and catalysts for 2021) So, you have made it through paragraph after paragraph of me talking about the uranium bull market, reasons why we need nuclear power, what will drive this market and what companies I feel like are best positioned to take advantage of it (if you haven't, I would advice reading them and the comments below each post to get an answer to any question you might have). Perhaps you may have decided to invest, so now what? General consensus is that when investing, it is best to invest for the long term. This could mean anywhere from 10, 20, 30 or the rest of your life in years, depending on what your goal is. This is not the case with uranium however. Yes I do bet on nuclear power being one of the most important solutions to climate change and yes I believe we will expand on it in a big way in the coming decade with next generation power plants and small modular reactors, but that is not how you want to invest in this market. The uranium market is cyclical and it should be treated as such, so how do we recognize the patterns and know when to get in or out?  

 
See, a cycle seems to be triggered when nuclear power utilities have to come into the market to sign new long term contracts with the suppliers of uranium, which is called a contracting cycle. Most contracts run for around 10 years, some longer and some shorter, but all long term. This causes a big increase in demand for uranium, because a lot of utilities are out of contract in 2021 and 2022 after they signed contracts during the last contracting cycle roughly 10 years ago. These utilities also cannot afford to be picky anymore, it has become a sellers’ market. The supply deficit has caused it to become a ‘take what you can get, no matter the price’ situation and with fuel only consisting of around 5% of the total cost to run a nuclear power plant, these utilities will contract at whatever price it takes to secure supply for the long term. The combination of this contracting cycle, a severe impact on production in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19, the lack of companies currently producing, the great reduction of mobile supply globally, the Q1 2021 closing of 2 major uranium mines, no expansion at Olympic Dam and the increasing demand of new reactors coming online will all come together to make a quite ridiculously convincing bull case in my view. Even the most skeptical people in the sector, those that try their hardest to dampen expectations, are astounded at how all these different catalysts have come together within the same time frame to form the case for this uranium bull market. 


Now, when do you actually sell your investments once we are fully into this bull market? It takes months upon months to negotiate and sign new long term contracts and it is not like all utilities will come to the market at the same time. With the biggest amount being out of contract somewhere in the next 2 years, they will start negotiating around that timeframe or a bit earlier than that. This bull market will come back down like the cyclical industry that it is when demand is mostly satisfied with these long term contracts and when new and old mines are brought back and the supply deficit shrinks, at least that is the general consensus of what will happen. Knowing this, I would think this bull market lasts somewhere into 2025, but the peak might be a bit earlier when everyone is scrambling for supply and the price per pound rises like it did in the previous bull market. When/if this price reaches roughly triple digits, is when you start selling out of your position. Do not do it all at once, as no one can predict the market, but start trimming your positions around that time. Selling into strength is your best bet here. Between 2004 and 2007, the price of uranium had to go up to around 50 dollars to incentivize new mining. It way overshot into triple digit territory due to a variety of reasons (mine floods, hedge fund buying, etc.) and came back down quickly after that. It could overshoot massively this time as well, but nobody knows if or when that might happen, so selling parts of your position around this time to lock in some gains is advisable. Remember, no one ever went broke taking a profit. Best of luck to all of you.

December is set to be the busiest year-end on record for initial public offerings in the U.S., with DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc. ready to start trading this week in long-awaited listings.

The two startups, which are aiming to raise a combined US$6.2 billion at the top-end of their price ranges, will propel the month’s IPO volume to all-time high, surpassing the US$8.3 billion mark set in December of both 2001 and 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IPOs on U.S. exchanges have already raised a record US$156 billion this year, the data show.

Both listings got an additional boost as the companies headed into the final stretch of marketing their shares. DoorDash upped the price range for its stock in a Friday filing, while Airbnb is planning to follow suit and increase its price range ahead of its IPO, people familiar with the matter said Sunday. The companies are now each expected to raise as much as US$3.1 billion, putting them among the top five biggest U.S. IPOs of 2020.

Private companies that sat out the market chaos in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic -- and were awaiting a final outcome in the U.S. election -- are now rushing to go public. Airbnb and DoorDash will quickly be followed by three other mega-listings that could add billions of dollars to the IPO tally.

Also on deck to go public this month are Affirm Holdings Inc., which lets online shoppers pay for purchases such as Peloton bikes in installments, online video-game company Roblox Corp. and ContextLogic Inc., the parent of discount online retailer Wish. Each is likely to attain a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in its listing.

“This group of companies that you have coming out now maybe weren’t thought of initially as benefiting, but they’ve been able to show very strong results despite the coronavirus,” said Karen Snow, head of East Coast listings at Nasdaq Inc.

Airbnb is aiming to be valued at as much as US$42 billion in its IPO, while DoorDash could hit a valuation of about US$35 billion, based on their updated price ranges. For DoorDash, that’s more than double the private valuation it hit in a June fundraising round, after it seized on the pandemic-fueled boom in demand for meals brought to your door. Airbnb had been valued at US$18 billion in April after raising additional debt to shore up its finances. The company, which was initially hit hard by global travel restrictions, has more recently seen a boom in customers seeking longer-term, domestic rentals.

Airbnb’s IPO will also be a lucrative event for many of its employees. The company has offered billions of dollars worth of stock compensation to staff, similar to Uber Technologies Inc. and other large venture-backed companies that have gone public. The IPO will make some of its longtime employees millionaires on paper.

**Time and Cash**

Earlier this year, technology IPOs were dominated by enterprise software companies such as Snowflake Inc., which has soared more than 200 per cent since its listing to a US$110 billion public market valuation. This month’s cluster of soon-to-be public entities -- all based in the San Francisco Bay Area -- cater to consumers stuck at home with extra time and cash on their hands.

Should the listings go well, it could signal investors are optimistic about an economic rebound after the dark days of the pandemic.

“There’s a lot of support and interest from institutional investors for companies that are impacted by COVID because the feeling is that they will recover,” said Neil Kell, Bank of America Corp.’s vice chairman of global equity capital markets.

“The mindset is not that we’re in December of 2020,” he said. “The mindset is how is it going to look a year from now.”

One enterprise software listing is also planned for this week. C3.ai Inc., founded by former Oracle Corp. executive Tom Siebel, is expected to raise as much as US$527 million in its IPO.

**Gauging Demand**

Bankers are using new methods to execute these large share sales, incorporating technology under development for years that was well-timed for use during the pandemic, when potential buyers can’t meet the company executives and advisers in person.

Airbnb, DoorDash and Roblox have asked prospective IPO investors to fill in their deal orders via an online portal, indicating their level of interest at any desired price, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.

The new process is aimed at helping issuers and their advisers gauge demand, especially for high-growth companies subject to wide differences in valuation among investors, the people said. The final price and share allocation are still determined by the seller.

Representatives for the companies declined to comment.

Dec 2020

Airbnb has brought the sharing economy to housing, connecting home owners (hosts) who own units or houses that they want to rent with renters (guests) online, collecting a percentage of the transaction revenues from both sides of the transaction. Its low capital intensity model and extended reach has allowed it to expand not only to expand to almost every part of the world (220 countries) but also provide an unmatched range of offerings. 

The growth in gross bookings has started to slow down, as the company gets bigger, and the COVID shut downs made 2020 a regressive year. That said, as its competitors in the hotel business have been damaged far more by the crisis, Airbnb will be able to recover quickly from the crisis, and continue on its growth path. Economies of scale will allow for only mild improvements in revenues as a % of gross billings, but the brokerage-based business will generate high margins, in steady state, and require relatively little reinvestment.

What Happened: The DFC is the federal agency that originally granted the loan. As per the Wall Street Journal, the DFC Inspector General Anthony Zakel reported his findings to Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) last week.

Zakel told Warren, who has been among the most vocal critic of what she earlier referred to as a “massive fiasco of a deal,” that the DFC in its review found no conflict of interest for the employees of the federal agency in the deal and that there is no “evidence of misconduct on the part of DFC officials.”

The loan was sanctioned at the behest of President Donald Trump in July this year.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also been reportedly probing the events surrounding around the loan, including allegations of potential insider trading violations.

A DFC spokesperson told the Journal, “the record is abundantly clear and the independent IG review confirms that DFC followed its standard process, under its standard timeline, driven by career finance professionals.”

Why Does It Matter: It isn't immediately clear if DFC will go forward with the loan.

One of Warren's aide claimed that Zakel's assessment didn't look into potential ties between the White House and other related parties with a political background. The associate also raised certain questions about the DFC’s procedures.

Zakel said the DFC limited the probe internally and “did not review conduct by Kodak or non-DFC personnel.“

Kodak shares have seen immense volatility since the announcement of the loan in July. Grant of stock options to Kodak Chairman and CEO Jim Continenza a day before the loan was announced, along with his purchase of a significant amount of shares in the company ahead of the loan raised eyebrows. 

An independent committee appointed by Kodak board in September concluded there was no violation of the law on part of the Rochester-based photography company but it flagged concerns related to corporate governance.

Continenza said in October that Kodak will move forward with the generic drug ingredients manufacturing venture even if the federal loan is not granted._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ brokerage account for Non-Resident Alien living in the USA - taxes matters I work in the US with visa type J and I file a taxes as a Non-Resident Alien.

ABNB

Airbnb (ABNB) is a hospitality company focused on disrupting the hotel and travel industry with apartment and house rentals with(out) a host. ABNB has grown since its inception in 2007, “We have experienced rapid growth since our founding. In 2019, we generated Gross Booking Value (“GBV”) of $38.0 billion, representing growth of 29% from $29.4 billion in 2018, and revenue of $4.8 billion, representing growth of 32% from $3.7 billion in 2018.”. Now despite taking losses with COVID-19 affecting the two industries they are focused in, they show great prospect with “Experiences”, financial statements from prior fiscal years, and an expansive market when quarantine restrictions loosen.

\- ABNB has great growth internationally, allowing them to prosper in other countries when the U.S. may not be doing well economically or otherwise. “As of September 30, 2020, we had over 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of the United States.” Having 14% of hosts inside the U.S. allows for a possible increase in the U.S. Market, but also shows ABNB’s resilience with having the majority of hosts international and available when certain countries may experience political issues or economic crises.

ABNB may seem questionable from an American view, but their structure of maintaining security and building trust with guests and hosts is a centerpoint to ABNB’s success. “Our host protections include property damage protection and liability coverage. In addition, our trust and safety initiatives include risk scoring, watchlist and background checks, fraud and scam prevention, secure messaging, secure payments, and minimum age requirements.” ABNB must be able to maintain this trust, which can easily shift with the media and lawsuits they are battling at the moment as mentioned further in their IPO under Risk Factors. The risk that actions taken by the hosts, guests, or a third-party involving crime or vice can undermine the reputation of ABNB should be a reminder that ABNB can be fragile and is built around trust, not results.

ABNB addresses their possible market, saying, “We have a substantial market opportunity in the growing travel market and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for short-term stays and $239 billion for experiences. We estimate our total addressable market (“TAM”) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences.” This is a large market for long-term growth that they can capitalize on once a vaccine for COVID-19 is approved and distributed, catalyzing travel and hospitality.

Acknowledgement of competition is very thorough, noting not only ABNB’s competitors in the travel industry, but the hospitality industry as well. Various competing agencies along with their properties can significantly impact the success of Airbnb, depending on who attracts more guests in the long term.“Online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands [Booking.com](https://booking.com/), KAYAK, [Priceline.com](https://priceline.com/), and [Agoda.com](https://agoda.com/)); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/), Orbitz, and Travelocity); [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) Group (including the brands [Ctrip.com](https://ctrip.com/), [Trip.com](https://trip.com/), Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba) Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs;” The Chinese market is also noted as major competition. Despite the majority of revenue and earnings from EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), the Chinese market is one that could have positive benefits for ABNB’s reach on the global scale. More competition includes the hospitality sector with “Hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels; Chinese short-term rental competitors, such as Tujia, Meituan B&B, and Xiaozhu; and Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, and KKDay.” ABNB is battling two different fronts and it can be important to consider their role and presence in both. Hurting the hospitality sector and negatively impact their travel sector as well.

Another significant risk factor noted was natural disasters. Homes that are affected by natural disasters can decrease the supply of hosts available in various countries. This decrease in supply can leave ABNB struggling to retain guests and can negatively affect revenue.

In conjunction with ABNB’s international reach, they noted that their revenues could be negatively affected by foreign exchange rates. “For the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 60% and 50% of our revenue, respectively, was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated.” The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar can harm their profits and could create financial difficulties in the future.

Supply and Demand are both important when considering a company’s product. Looking at consumer demand, we see an increase even during the pandemic with “Approximately 76% of active listings had been booked in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and 90% had been booked in the 24-month period ended September 30, 2020.” ABNB has a growing niche for hosting and we can expect this demand to grow after the pandemic as well as more people begin to travel abroad again and may not consider a public hotel.

Experiences were briefly mentioned, ABNB hosting experiences including cooking lessons, virtual activities, and virtual animal visits. There is minimal data and research on Experiences’ growth and valuation, but could be seen as a giant gap to purchase another company or grow.

Financial Summary:

Key Takeaways:

We have seen aggressive growth in product development over the past three years and then averaging around $690 million. Sales and marketing have also increased with over $1 billion, increasing their range of guests and hosts. Although we did see a dropoff in this expense, part of the decrease can be accounted for by the effects of COVID-19. Looking at Total Cost and Expenses, the largest sum was in 2019. ABNB’s filing for 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30 shows a decrease in these expenses. This can be because of a decrease in demand so a decrease in spending, but also shows that they are able to handle debt and can cut down on these expenses if necessary.

Key Takeaways:

Total assets are greater than total liabilities. However, we have seen a spike in liabilities in the last column, an increase of about $1 billion. Working capital is hovering between $1 and $2 billion. Cash and other equivalents are stronger from prior years, increasing cash in the final column, showing budget cuts ABNB has made to survive the pandemic.

The increase in Bookings year over year shows the growth of the industry and the potential it has to offer, increasing dramatically since 2015 and maintaining this solid growth.

The increase in free cash flow also supports this growing company. We do see a sharp decline in cash flow during 2019, but note that expenses also increased that year in the financial statement.

Despite the decrease in both domestic and international travel, domestic travel has rebounded significantly, showing the flexibility ABNB offers even during difficult housing times.

But one thing that has remained is people taking advantage of people in need for their own gain..

When the lockdown hit we were not sure of our finances and if we can afford to see 2021. Our loans and debt are manageable but only if we make what we make. However we had a little savings. working for an organization that helps the poor and downtrodden I was not making a killing financially and my wife is not either. We managed to scrape together a little bit before the lockdown and decided to hold on to it in case one of us needed anything medical done. This was around $2000 and os our total savings..

Fast forward a few weeks into lockdown, its all a blur right now so cant really pinpoint a date. We got invited to invest into a platform from a reputable source. This promised 15% return on investment based on a contract and would pay out after the said time. It was called Blockflux

We decided to put in half of the cash we have and keep the rest safe. Smart choice looking at it now.. 

We could see our money grow. every contact added 15% and BTC was doing well so it made sense.. Until!!!

The site went down. Wat seemed od was the way the site referred to things in broken english. I remember it saying something to the effect of “complaint at public wall will be ban” Its then i got a chill down my spine! I knew.

Blockfux / Birdflux were building a new site.. they were down for a few weeks and then back up. They now split the site between new and old server. I was obviously on the old server as i had a old account. Realized that i can very easily invest again but not withdraw at all.

Then the VAT thing. 
They (Dr Victor)started saying Finland (where the company is based) is now charging 24% vat and must be paid to them before you can withdraw your funds.. and here was the final nail in our coffin.. the old server was to close in 14days. They now trade under the name TradeCore or something like that.

Today as i write this, hundreds of people as flocking to facebook to cry for help as their money is taken.  And i get it, we fell for a trick, we saw easy money and we should have known. 

But my point is, we had this weight of uncertainty ahead of us for 2021, we tried our best to make the most of it and being ignorant we listened to the wrong people. People who BYW made money off of it and pulled out in the beginning.

Im so sad and broken-hearted, i feel ashamed that i pulled my wife into this. That i made such a stupid judgment call and that I’ve basically signed/sealed our fate in debt and we will probably be in debt for years, delaying starting a  family having kids and so on. Man I screwed up!

I really hope and pray that none of you ever run into this. My heart is that you will never be in my position.. I still have to tell my wife, she is asleep next to me now and im honestly terrified. Not of telling her, but of breaking her heart.

If i could have one wish come true this holiday season, its to give my family hope back and give you, reading this, the tools to not make my mistake ever again..

Hopeless, heartbroken and defeated.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rebalancing asset classes before a market crash Hi all. I was wondering what you would all suggest as the best strategy for rebalancing before a market crash? Although I know anything can happen, I’m preparing my game plan for an upcoming 2000 style crash. Specifically I’m imagining the current stock market will ascend with more stimulus and low interest rates. This will drive up equities, precious metals, and reits. Bonds and cash are currently unfavorable.  However, if things proceed and the market balloons, I imagine that the Fed will eventually allow treasury yield to increase similar to the lead up to 2000 I believe the Fed will take the same strategy as in 2000 because the market bubble was deflated relatively very slowly. Something similar also happened in 1934ish.  I think the Fed and the owners of the world would prefer an orderly and slow crash over a quick and unpredictable crash. So, just as equities are obviously going parabolic and the treasury yields are increasing, I believe this would be the time to rebalance from equities to bonds and cash (and perhaps skeptically into precious metals and reits). 

Do you all have ideas about which asset classes you’d favor pre-crash?

 I’m thinking TLT (long term treasuries). I believe the decades long price trend of TLT would be easy to read for when it’s favorable to invest. It’s pretty linear with large oscillations throughout the larger trend. Also, I’d probably hold more in cash as well.

Ozon listed its ADRs (American Depository Receipts) on 11/24/2020.

I strongly believe it offers both good short-term and long-term investment opportunity and I'll explain to you why.

Some you may be aware that Ozon is considered to be the Amazon of Russia in the investment community.

I partially agree with that statement but it's irrelevant to our analysis on the company.

**I. Business Overview**

Ozon was founded in 1999 and is also known as the “Amazon of Russia”. It operates an e-commerce platform that allows both the Company and the sellers to upload their product offerings and sell to the buyers.

It derives its revenues from two main segments: the MarketPlace transactions and Direct sales. The Marketplace is 3P (third-party relationship) business where individual sellers list their products on the website and Ozon takes a share of the transaction. It contributed 15% of total revenue in 3Q2020 but accounted for 45% of total GMV in the nine months ended 9/30/2020, up from 12% of total GMV in the nine months ended 9/20/2019.

Direct Sales is a 1P (first-party relationship) business where Ozon lists products and acts as the retailer, and the brand is the wholesale supplier. It accounted for 79% of total revenue in 3Q2020 and 51% of GMV in the nine months ended in 9/30/2020.

**II. Thesis I: Strong Value Proposition and Economic Moat**

Ozon has proven that its value propositions to both the buyers and sellers of the marketplace are sustainable and growing, as evidenced by the following list of factors.

• Exponentially increasing number of both active sellers and buyers. Active sellers on the platform grew from 1.3k in 1Q2019 to 18.1k in 3Q2020. Active buyers increased from 1.3mm in 1Q2019 to 11.4mm in 3Q2020.

📷

• Increasing NPS (net promoter score), from 58 to 79 during 1Q2019 to 3Q2020. It is measured by internal surveys sent to the customers after a purchase. This translates to a growing buyer retention rate and order frequency.

📷📷

• Wide range of product offerings: 92% of SKU (stock keeping units) were offered by the sellers through the Marketplace.

📷

• Brand awareness: 32% brand-awareness compared to 18% for nearest competitor, according to INFOLine and BrandScience.

• More than 40% of population covered with the next day delivery.

• Avg of 5 orders per active buyer in 12 months ended 3Q2020, an increase from 3.8 orders in 9/30/2019.

• Mission statement: Our mission is to transform the Russian consumer economy by offering the widest selection of products, best value and maximum online shopping convenience among Russian e-commerce companies, while empowering sellers to achieve greater commercial success.

• Largest fulfillment center network and delivery infrastructure in Russia, consisting of approximately 43 sorting hubs, 7,500 parcel lockers, 4,600 pick-up points and 2,700 couriers.

**III. Thesis II: Total Addressable Market is growing and penetration rate is low.**

• Total addressable market is large and growing quickly. Russian retail market is 4th largest in Europe, totaling ₽33.6tn in 2019 and expected to grow to ₽46.2tn in 2025.

📷📷

• Domestic e-commerce market is also under-penetrated and growing rapidly. Excluding cross-border e-commerce, domestic e-commerce market was ₽1.4tn in 2019, growing at 26% CAGR 2016-2019. It is projected to grow to ₽6.8tn by 2025, or CAGR of 30%.

o E-commerce penetration in Russia was 6.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.3% and 3.7% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

📷

o Internet penetration is high, at 83%.

o Smartphone possession rate is also high, at 75%.

o The orders made through mobile app accounted for 70% of orders in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase from 51% of orders in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

• Retail market is highly fragmented, allowing for e-commerce players to effectively penetrate the market and preventing large competitors from taking away market share quickly. Top ten businesses representing 25% of total retail sales in the country, compared to 42%, 40% and 35% in UK Germany and US.

📷

**IV. Thesis III: Profit margins are widening and sales are accelerating.**

📷📷

**V. Economy**

• Healthy recovery and developed economy

• Stable annual GDP growth rate

📷

• Rising stock market and strengthening currency

📷📷

• More stabilized inflation rate

📷

• Low unemployment rate

• Growing fiscal spending

📷

• Rebound in business confidence index, PMI and Services PMI

📷

**VI. Risks**

• Primary risk from my perspective is the bloated valuation, based on a comps table.

📷

o The reason for the valuation is partly due to the different lines of businesses that the comp set is in, which range from fashion retail businesses to furniture-focused companies.

o Another important reason is that Ozon’s shares trade on NASDAQ through American Depository Receipts, providing more liquidity to the investors.

• Furthermore, rising COIVD cases can pose threats to the Company’s business.

**VII. Conclusion**

I believe Ozon offers a strong value proposition for its customers through the wide range of product offerings and large infrastructure network, as evidenced by the high customer retention rate, NPS score, active buyers and sellers on the platform, and growing GMV.

A solid business model coupled with a growing total addressable market offers the company a chance to increase its penetration rate.

Russian economy seems to be in a path to rebound based on a few economic indicators.

The valuation multiples are nowhere at an “attractive level” compared to peers but I believe the growth rates will prove to justify them sooner than later.

Taking into account the valuation and pandemic risks, the company offers very good risk/reward investment opportunity both in the short and long-term.

**VIII. Trading Plan**

I simply bought only shares. I believe using margins to buy shares on the company will be a good way to both use leverage and take advantage of the long-term capital gains tax rate. Using options on the company will be riskier and it seems the brokerage doesn't allow for trading options yet, at least for Interactive Brokers.

I plan on adding onto the shares as time passes and the company continues to prove its value proposition.

Ozon is one of my favorite picks at the moment. I'll keep a close eye on the company and will provide any updates.

Thanks for reading!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stop looking for advice In 1997 there was a study conducted by Duke University[1], that if you followed the recommendation of the best 10% of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annualized return from 1991 through 1995.

But if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.

It's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.

My biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. 

Fuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back. 

Sure, it's good to see what's new once in a while, learn what other people think. But basing your financial moves on other people, even if it's Warren Buffet will make you lose money in the long term.
