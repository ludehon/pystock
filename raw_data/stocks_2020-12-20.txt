It's been reported that it's *indeterminate* whether this new strain is more lethal but evidence suggest otherwise.

First, we know that the mutation is most prevalent in Kent and Medway \[2\]. Having discovered the hotspot, we investigate the death rate in that area. The death rate in Medway on Dec 4 and Dec 13 was 70% higher than other counties \[3\] \[4\].

Lastly, it's known that the South African variant has the similar changes in the spike protein \[5\]. Moreover, the critical illness found in young people is alot higher than expected based on data in other countries. Therefore the new strain is sends more young people to the hospital.

As we have observed, the new strain in the UK is more infectious, and lethal. Also, it is shown that it sends more young people to the hospital in South Africa. Extrapolating these data points, globally entails another global lockdown for orderly vaccination.

Worse, vaccination do not protect against the new strain and we repeat 2020 again.

Chinese growth is the only demand keep the world economy afloat. Should the new strain leak from hong kong into mainland china before the New Year travel, and causes a spike in cases there, it is game over.

Puts until the financial crisis.

Even with the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit, the Ford will still cost more than the Tesla. I don't see anyone looking at that and choosing a Ford over a Tesla when it comes to EVs.  Why will Ford be a successful electric car manufacturer. Also, if Biden wants to push EVs and up the number of Tax Credits available by each company, Tesla will be able to take off that $7,500.

&#x200B;

**$ADC**: Beautiful channel. It is a possible triangle as well. This is a very strong support area, if it does die, just buy in at trendline or next support for more profit. RSI and Stochastic oversold.

**$AMH**: Literal textbook ascending triangle. This is the same set up as $SMAR, $FEYE, and other major winners we have had. Great value, 200EMA support, Stochastic oversold with divergence? Love this play so much.

**$AMRX**: We literally just made 20% off of this. It has historically had pullbacks on big moves up, and this is that I think. It is also right above BOTH the 50 and 200EMA at a support? So much convergence here. Stochastic oversold.

**$AOS**: What a great channel up, and at a strong support area as well! It technically has room to drop back to the 200EMA, but it has strength to keep running here.

**$ATO**: Long term triangle, which is great. Support area is very strong here as well. Consistence higher lows so it can't get much lower here hopefully. Also sowing Stochastic oversold divergence.

**$AUPH**: What a value here, how much lower can it get here?! Of course it CAN go lower, but then we just cut and buy in next support. Stoch, RSI over sold which is also great.

**$CNCE**: This channel was broken and now it is retesting it, so that is our play here. May possibly drop to the 50EMA which is also an easy play for us. Stoch shows volume is coming.

**$CRK**: Same play as $AUPH basically.

**$JILL**: Just made 18% off of it and now we trying it again. Channel gives us great results, and it is technically an ascending triangle here too. I think this has massive potential.

**$PCH**: Same play as $CNCE

**$TEVA**: Great ascending triangle that is now at a support which I love. 200EMA is also right here which is fantastic. RSI and Stochastic oversold, so I think it is really gearing up to push up farther.

**$TGT**: This one is not ready yet, let it drop a little more to the 200EMA / golden channel then go long; but I do not want you to miss this one.

**$TXN**: This bounces off the 50EMA line like clockwork, if it DOES break, you just buy at the 200EMA. Could not be any easier, the gold lines are just good indications for where they stay near.

**$UNVR**: Ascending triangle here, but it does have a history of failing and not breaking out. But when it does, it is going to go crazy. Also riding the 50EMA.

**$WMT**: Needs to hold the 200EMA here. If it does not, buy in at the bottom gold line. Stochastic and RSI say it does have more room to drop too. But it keeps going up, so even if you mess up your entry, you'll eventually be green._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options expired ITM (please advice) My broker is Questrade. So I was trading options before market close on Friday and my 5 calls expired in the money for $DKNG

(I was anticipating big move and wanted to close my position before market close) 

So I placed an order to STC but it didn’t fill and the bid/ask spread was huge so I waited and waited then ding the bells went off and exchanges closed.

So my total balance is only like 10k USD and my margin is maximized. So what happens now? This is the first time an option expired in my account. I don’t hold them usually and STC.

$DKNG $53.50 x 500 = $26,750 USD

Will the broker purchase this shares and my account will go into margin call? I am fine with that as I don’t mind buying the shares for that price and going long but will they give me enough time to make a deposit to cover this? Could the broker decide not excersice my options as my margin excess is less the $100 USD left?

So many people are sharing a fallacious Yahoo Finance article which shamelessly exaggerates the impact of the bill that Trump signed recently is going to have on the Chinese tickers. I agree that this bill is going to affect the shady Chinese companies, but the already established ones like $BABA, $JD, ,$NIO, $LI, $XPEV etc. should not be impacted at all. Rather, in my opinion, they are more likely to benefit from this bill because of the probable redistribution of funds in favor of them.

The author of the article has considerable positions in an inverse ETF that benefits from the downfall of Chinese companies [this information is disclosed at the end of the article].

Definitely, NIO has support from the Chinese government:

>A big reason for Nio being competitive in the EV space is because of the support it receives from the government. Last year, the government supported Nio by offering it a RMB7 billion (US$1b) bailout last year, providing the company some much needed financial support (the company's cash was down to RMB863m at the end of 2019 from RMB3.1b in the preceding year).

Hence, this seems to be a very risky stock. However, an opportunity for us. How? Because:

1. NIO and other Chinese stocks have 3 years to comply with the legislation.
2. If they fail to do so, they might be delisted from NYSE but **NOT** from the other stock exchanges. However, there might be some stock transfer charges which NIO shareholders have to undergo which no one is clear about.

So much for growth lolz.  Thank you. The stock dropped precipitously from like 8 something to 6 something.  On a day when people want security embedded into their interconnected ai stuff, blackberry seemed like a good play.  It had lower revenues on business deals in a market carving itself out. The EV play. Especially after the other security companies had great days, I think BB is dramatically undervalued with their patent portfolio and is poised to do well in emerging field of security in interconnected things._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Your most promising stocks for the next decade? I'm currently looking for a few new stocks to invest in, so would be interested to hear people's favourite / highest conviction stocks and why. 

Mine would be:

Tesla - the EV market will grow rapidly in the next decade and I believe Tesla will be at the forefront of this

Visa - cash will be gone within 5 years i think. Visa is the best placed to take advantage of this due to their massive reach and popularity 

Roblox - a huge platform with lots of room to grow- China, VR etc. I think their IPO will be interesting._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to learn about stocks if I’m completely clueless? I’m in my early twenties and have always wanted to learn about stocks and investing but never knew how to actually get started. I’ve tried to look at different videos but I’m always lost the moment they start talking about options, puts, etc since I have no idea what these even mean.

Anyone know the best way for a beginner to start learning?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What's going to be the story with NWARF come Monday AM? Hi Everyone, Happy Holiday's! 
New to investing and lucked out on NWARF buying in at $ 0.8 and it just spiked 8,000% to $6.50. I bought because of the bankruptcy protection news so I figured an immediate tanking and loss was slim chance. Had no clue it would go up like THIS honestly.  Now do I take my winnings with all this debt looming over Norwegian Air or do I stay in the game?

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on FVRR and ZEN Both very undervalued, I was looking at potential growth. I'm not so sure about fiverrs growth but zendesk provides one of few support center software programs used by big companies.

Both companies are trading at a negative P/E ratio.

Let me know what you guys know or what you think about these stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Jobs in Finance Hello,
I have some pretty general questions about getting into the field of finance and was hoping some people in this forum may be able to provide some helpful insight.

I have "managed" my personal trading accounts for the last 5 years. I have a 401k that is completely passive, a roth which I actively manage, a futures account that I trade on daily daily, and a speculative account I run options strategies in. 

I really enjoy macro and micro research, company specific research, growth forecasting, competition analysis, management teams research, and risk analysis and planning.

I find the trading side, futures and options strategies, equally enjoyable.

I separate these interests because I assume these interests are attributable to different roles within the industry. 

I'm curious what titles align with my interests (junior analyst ? , Trader ?) and what steps would I need to take in order to pursue any applicable careers?

If this info matters :
 BA psychology
 BA environmental science
5 years experience as a project manager for a residential development company
In the process of learning Python
Trading journal for 2020 capturing all my 2020 futures and options trading. Can get into win rate and avg p/l, R:R stuff if needed.

I was thinking it would take a harder fall after all the recent news about Chinese stocks and loss of momentum however it has rebounded from the low 40s quicker than I thought. I was thinking about putting a portion of the profits I took back in and was curious to get others thoughts on doing that now or waiting for a significant red day?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRWD value With the recent Solar Winds breach, will CRWD be awarded government contracts to shore up systems?

Penn National Gaming has had an amazing year. It was down to 6$ in march, but has only gone up since. It’s now over 90$.

I really believe that sports gambling is huge and will become a massive industry.
I also believe that Barstool will one day be one of the biggest media companies in America.

So this week, their drug was found safe for covid19 patients and it actually helps their symptoms. Correct me if I'm wrong but, this drug is basically used to reduce inflammation in the body. It was initially used to treat knee pain from osteoporosis (I think). It was administered by IV for this. But then they made a inhaler being test currently.

It just peaked 2.50 / share on friday. I have ABSOLUTELY no idea where the ceiling is here. Could it be 2.50? Maybe. But maybe its 5$? or its another pfizer with a ceiling of $40 in 2021.

I have no idea how wide spread a drug like this could be. But even with a vaccine people will still have lung issues, its being tested for COPD, because it was found to be effective against that when inhaled. (Along with covid19)

Shits looking promising, and the market looks like they're diving in.

I'm 20 and I'm fairly new to investing in stocks. I used to live in Singapore where Shopee (subsidiary of Sea Limited) is a major player in the e-commerce sector. I bought 25 shares of Sea at $39 and I've been holding ever since. 

I am quite confused about the volatility of Sea's stock price these past few months. The stock will make big gains then have big drops and it repeats again and again. I am confident in Sea for the long run so I never sold and the overall trend of the stock is increasing anyways. I always assumed that people were taking profits which is why there were big drops in price but why is it happening so often?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will I be able to do my swing trades with a fulltime job?
