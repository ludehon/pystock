To keep it simple let's use a stock portfolio as an example, you have total control around each company you own (no index funds.)

Would you buy a stock in which the company tested on animals if you're a strong animal advocate just because the company or stock is doing well?

Would you buy Hormel ($HRL) if you're a vegan?

How about political reasons? 
If you're a strict conservative, Would you buy AT&T ($T) knowing they own CNN?

I just want to throw my predictions down about where Teslas stock is going to be at in a year. I was one of the few investors who predicted that Tesla would begin their exponential ascend this year and have since become a millionaire. I am telling this to give my prediction here a little more weight (and ok to brag a little;)).

So: if my predictions continue being correct I expect Tesla to be at roughly 1200$ in a year.

There are so many triggers that will send Tesla even higher in the year to come. Primary of these being the wide release of Teslas Full Self driving to all users (at least all in the US). This will show how huuuuge an advantage Tesla has over the competition. I furthermore believe that this year might be the year where we begin to refer to cars as "Smart cars" - just as we shifted from mobilephones to smartphones back in 2008-2010. This shift to smart cars will further illustrate just how much further Tesla is than every single competitor.

What I also think this year could bring is a new business model (which Elon already has eluded to): That Tesla will start to charge the competitors to use their services. This goes for both the Tesla charging Network but ALSO the licensing of their full self driving technology. This is the year that the competition will come to realise that they are VERY far behind, and the competitors who dares swallow their own pride and acknowledge this will begin to license Teslas software. Again going back to smart cars: just like Google licenses Android to other phone manufactures. And who knows - this might also be the case for their battery technology!

They also have a lot of other advantages that will begin to pay of the next year:

\-Tesla insurance (which will increase the margin for each car sold)

\-Solar roof business 

\-Tesla Auonomy taxi service

And of course another trigger is the expansion of their production capabilities with the opening of Giga Berlin and their production target of about 1 million cars.

Are there any of these you would be nervous holding? Anything you would want to add?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can a secondary offering ever fail? Hi community! I have a question which needs some expertise! Please help!
I’m holding a large position of a company that is issuing a secondary offering. The offering is expected to close on 12/21 per the company’s press but there’s no news yet. I wonder if there’s a possibility that the underwriters couldn’t find enough buyers at the target price and what would usually happen if that’s the case? Have you guys seen any situations like that?

P.S., My position is iQIYI.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your top stock picks for the new year? Hey all,

&#x200B;

What are your top stocks for the new year? I am currently invested in NIO, ARKG, AAPL, and NNDM. I anticipated NIO to make big leaps so long as it's not delisted. AAPL will definitely rise since they will start the car production. ARKG because why not. NNDM because idk. lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Warning About Bitcoin This post will probably be downvoted to oblivion by all the people drinking the crypto kool aid, but I am going to share it anyways in hopes that some smart investors listen to my advice.

For the sake of this post, I will be discussing the US market but the same could be said about any country with a privately owned central banking system (aka most of the world). Also, I am going to do my best to cover topics and points at a high level so I don’t have to write a novel. This is by no means a comprehensive analysis, just a quick summary.

We are currently in a massive bubble due to the economy being artificially inflated by massive amounts of printing. Many Bitcoin investors are putting their capital into this BTC for that exact reason, as BTC is limited in supply to 21 million coins.

The problem is BTC doesn’t have any real world value. BTC will never be allowed to be accepted at retailers in the US for many reasons. The most important, however, is that the Federal Reserve would never allow another currency to compete against its own. Even if the USD is completed inflated into nothing, they will come out with their own CBDC (central bank digital currency) and back it with precious metals or their own blockchain. BTC can be taxed or regulated to discourage legitimate investors from touching the asset, or it could be outright banned leaving very few people who will to continue to keep their wealth in the coin.

As an example, let’s pretend I live in the US and I invest “Red Dollars” which is a digital currency on a blockchain. Let’s also assume this currency takes off and everyone starts to use it to buy their groceries, ect. (which isn’t possible because again it’s a digital only currency and digital transactions are controlled primarily by the credit card companies, banks, and government regulations). But for this example let’s just pretend it’s true. Are you honestly blind enough to believe the Federal Reserve would allow it’s own system of control to be replaced? Don’t be foolish. There is of course way too much volatility as well in the price for retailers to accept it.

This is the same bubble as in 2017. People back then were saying the same clickbait titles of $200,00 price predictions and X investor is buying and FOMO and lambos. (note: notice how no one is talking about it’s real world use, just how much money they can make..)

John McAfee even said he would even eat his own dick on national TV if BTC wasn’t worth $1M by 2020.

Yes the blockchain is a great idea and will be used in future innovation. Yes the only value of BTC is the hope someone will pay more for it then you did. This is known as a Ponzi scheme. There is no real world value. Proponents say it is “digital gold” and it’s a way to “store wealth”. Yes that’s possible as long as everyone continues to leave their fiat dollars invested in it and people don’t make mass withdrawals, because again, there is no real world use and there never will be.

Finally, just so we are clear, I am against the fiat system. We can make the world a lot better place by once again backing our currency with precious metals which would eliminate inflation and remove us from the debt based system we are currently in. 

“tHiS TiMe iS DiFfEreNt”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying gold I get buying gold to preserve wealth, but do goldbugs not realize that  gold doesn't actually ever increase in value? It just becomes more or  less expensive in fiat, but the buying power has basically been the same  for over 100 years, except the 70s where it was basically worthless  (although this was right before the rampant inflation of the 80s).

I pretty much understand how it applies to stocks and what I can and cannot do but I'm still quite confused how it applies to MF, ETF and other non-stock securities.

Example, I sell an ETF or MF that has Apple as one of its holdings for loss. I don't like the MF/ETF has performed in general and I'm selling it for loss but I notice Apple itself is doing ok and I believe will be doing better. So I sell this ETF for loss and buy individual Apple stocks, does this count as wash sale?

I sell an ETF/MF that has 80+ holdings for loss. I decided to purchase similar ETF/MF that has similar holdings as the one I just sold for loss. maybe not all 80 holdings but let's say 10 of them.. Does this count as wash sale?

Does wash sale apply to IRA accounts? I understand I cannot sell Apple stocks for loss and re-buy them in my IRA account. But what if I already have Apple stocks in my IRA account. I decided to sell them for less and repurchase them for less within 30 days in my IRA account?

Last, my understanding. The act of selling for loss and repurchasing for less within 30 days is okay. What is not okay is to use the loss to offset my capital gains/income? So, I can do this as long as I don't take advantage of the loss?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Old sayings, new mediums I used to work in a call center for a big broker and one of the older lifers used to say “If your mail man is telling you about a stock, it’s time to get out.”

I like to think this has evolved as I don’t talk to my mail woman who is listening to her AirPod pros, but I do have my siblings of all people sending me tiktok links to kids talking about investing. 

For example, one major breakthrough tiktok I was forwarded he 500k likes, and only said “ you can tell what big banks invest in by just following their disclosure of what assets they hold. By doing this you follow people who have lots of money.” 

While that is semi-ok advice as it combats an analyst from JP Morgan releasing a target price on TSLA $90 a share, while the company acquired millions and holds millions at a higher share price, it leads people to believe one technique will liberate your portfolio from short falls. 

So it isn’t necessarily a stock pick that the general public is privy to that you should now avoid because it’s overbought, it’s the incessant nature of a green investor that only using that one investment technique.

Please justify._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NIU - NIU Technologies (Chinese EV) Wanted to know your collective thoughts on NIU technologies, a Chinese EV with ADRs listed on the Nasdaq. This is not your typical EV, as it doesn't sell cars, but sells electric scooters in Asia, particularly China.

[https://www.niu.com/en/](https://www.niu.com/en/)

**Growth**

The growth thesis here is the improvement in standard of living in Asia (China / Southeast Asia), first and foremost, and that scooters are absolutely rampant in China and Asia, which speaks to the total addressable market here vs. automobiles. In fact, many in Asia prefer scooters over cars because of the portability, ease of navigation (in small and crowded streets), and simple convenience of pick-up-and-go and not having to find a designated parking spot.

The North American prospect is that with more work-from-home capabilities going forward, communities will become more localized. What I mean is that no longer will you have to get in your car and travel long distances to get to work. The new normal is that you will spend more of your time working from home, which limits your need for a full sized car, and you will spend most of your time within your local neighborhood or community -- where owning an electric scooter makes the most sense economically and practically (weather permitting). It is perhaps the "greener" way forward for the masses. You are already seeing the shift here in the growing popularity of e-bikes.

It's important to note here that they aren't making the run-of-the-mill e-Scooter, and that they are trying to build a brand to differentiate themselves. This might be quite pivotal in gaining foothold and becoming a household name in the e-Scooter industry in Asia (like the Vespa brand for gas scooters). There will inevitably be competitors -- how NIU technologies differentiates itself will be a key factor, as with all business models.

**Management**

The company is run by Dr. Yan Li -- here are some videos of him speaking on Bloomberg and CNBC about the company. He mentions some of the ideas noted above in these videos -- basically stating that using a scooter for daily commute / running errands makes the most sense.

CNBC -- [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/04/nasdaq-listing-gave-our-electric-moped-company-credibility-niu-ceo-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/04/nasdaq-listing-gave-our-electric-moped-company-credibility-niu-ceo-says.html)

**Financials**

To note, these guys aren't using an auditor that is inspected by the **PCAOB** \-- so that might be a red flag.

Year-end is Dec. 31. and they normally report Q1 earnings in the Mar/Apr timeframe. The FY20-Q3 release in November was disappointing vs expectations. They did note in the release that some decreases were caused by "fluctuation of demand in the China market, and also by a 3-day suspension of production and delivery at our factory due to facility and machinery maintenance".  On the bright side, they also stated in the release that "in November 2020, sales volume for the first 19 days has surpassed the total sales volume for the entire month of November 2019".

**Profitability**

Their year-end is Dec. 31st. So, as of the writing of this post, their fiscal year is about to come due. They normally release Q1 earnings in the Mar/Apr timeframe. Looking at the 2019 financial statements, the company finally turned a profit at the end of 2019 at USD $0.18/share. For FY20, up to Q3 so far, they are maintaining positive profitability with earnings estimates for FY20 expected at USD $0.37/share -- but we will have to see whether this comes to fruition -- time will tell. Key take away here is that they are positive on the profitability front.

**Cash Flow**

In FY19, they also finally produced positive free cash flow (as measured by deducting capital expenditures from Operating Cash Flows). This was helped caused by improving net income, increasing the gross margin of their products by 10% from the prior year. They also produced positive cash flow in FY17 as well. FY18 was particularly hurt because of (USD $39M) share based compensation in FY18.

**Balance Sheet**

As of the most recent quarter (Q3 2020). They seem to be well capitalized, with C*urrent* Assets almost 1.6x T*otal L*iabilities. Their current assets are almost 86% of Total Assets, which suggests they are on a foundry-like model where they don't own the manufacturing. 46% of their assets as of FY20-Q3 is in short-term investments, which is a bit alarming. This *could* be due to the pandemic slowdown.

**Valuation**

At the end of FY19, the stock traded at about 52x earnings. As of current earnings expectations, the stock is trading at 77x FY20 earnings. On the valuation front, you will really have to believe in the growth thesis. This is not a value play to say the least.

**TL;DR:**

Overall, I believe there are growth prospects here for this company if you believe the thesis stated in the *Growth* section. Assessment of management might need some further digging, but profitability, cashflow, and balance sheet strength are there. Balance sheet capitalization is impeccable which is a bit scary. Valuation is fairly high due to the whole EV run up in the summer -- you will def. have to believe in the growth thesis to justify the stock at this price.

They do not use an auditor that is inspected by the PCAOB, so that might be a red flag. From what I understand, hiring a PCOAB approved auditor isn't that hard -- getting a legit clean opinion is another story (should be okay if they are doing their financials legitimately)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VanEck filed again today for a Bitcoin ETF.

Problem 1. The Purpose of Investing
What is the purpose of investing? Why do companies need investors? The way I understand it is companies need investors to raise money to grow their buisness especially in the early stages when they are unprofitable. This makes total sense to me. I completely understand this part. What I don't understand is why would a profitable company still need investors? Why would a company profiting billions of dollars still need investors? It seems to me that once you become profitable you shouldn't need investors anymore. If your company can not sustain itself without investors then your company is not going to do well in the long run. This is my major problem with the stock market. Its almost like the buisness isn't the product the company is selling. The buisness is the investors. And this is true. Jeff Bezos didn't become the richest person in the world by selling stuff on Amazon he became the richest person in the world by convincing other people to invest in his company. 

Problem 2. Dividends
Why do profitable companies no longer pay dividends? The way I understand it dividends are payed to share holders as their cut of the profits. It only seems fair to me that if a company is profitable and you own part of that company then you are entitled to a share of the profits. Amazon claims to be reinvesting the money they would have paid out as dividends back into the company. And by doing so this makes Mr. Bezos even richer. It seems like a slap in the face to the investors. In other words Not only am I going to take your money and use it to boost my net worth but I'm not even going to give you your share of the profits. I'm going to keep that too and "reinvest" it into the company. 

So those are my two major problems. 

With all of that being said the stock market can greatly increase your own net worth. I myself have benefited greatly from investments. But my little bit of money combined with millions of other people money makes someone somewhere a billionaire and if I get lucky and happen to buy and sell the right thing at the right time I might make a little bit of money too. So I guess that is what makes all of this okay.

Again I might be wrong on all of this that's why I'm posting this to get some clarification.

Edit: I don't know why you guys are down voting my question.  I thought I made it clear that I don't understand and that I'm looking for clarity on this subject. This is a great way to run new people off guys. I made an argument and you guys are acting like I attacked or something. I feel like this is a valid question. This is just how I see things and I'm just looking for someone to help me understand. I'm not trying to offend anyone or cause any problems. 

None of you have been able to answer my concern that the stock market allows large companies to become huge and too powerful. Small business can not compete with the massive amounts of cash these companies are generating. 

A small buisness makes its money from sales. A large publicly traded company makes most of its money from investors. 

I'm not saying we should do away with the stock market. I'm not anti stock market. These are just concerns I have._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AI + Batteries Has anyone done due diligence on STPK?

MSTR has 70,470 bitcoins

This is currently $214 in bitcoin per share.  This leaves the business value at $169.  Those numbers are reasonable given the price before the bitcoin purchases ($150ish) and the market move since then.

However, Michael Saylor has shown he is ready to take advantage of debt markets.

If bitcoin continues to go up, or even if it holds where it is, he can easily access additional debt markets.  At that point, his best play early on, would be to buy MORE shares in his company, versus buying more bitcoin - although I am fine with him buying more bitcoin.

This creates a levered bitcoin play in the stock market.  There is absolutely nothing like that, currently, and it should generate whatever return bitcoin has times some multiple.

When it comes to stocks/bonds, it seems like if you're following a broad-market buy and hold approach (e.g. bogleheads) then whenever the cost of borrowing is less than the anticipated total return, you should lever up (subject to risk tolerance, ability to service debt, etc). While I don't expect to get 10x or 20x leverage in my stock portfolio like one could get in RE, and getting a mortgage type loan against a stock portfolio is not really possible (is it?)

Fairly new to investing...currently 40% in index funds, 60% cash.

Very hesitant with the stock market with overvalued PEs, etc. 

Not sure what to do with the 60% cash. I know there's the saying "don't try to time the market" particularly as I have a long investment horizon 25+ years. 

Would it make sense to "park" the 60% cash in a high dividend ETF until if/when (big IF) a crash or correction comes.

I wanted to break down on the reasons why I decided to invest in Beyond Meat and why I think it is a great company to invest in.  

As we may all agree, current course that meat and food production has taken is not sustainable. There is a beautiful report by EAT-Lancet Commission, which breaks down this problematic far better than I ever could. Please have a look below, if you don’t know about it:  

[Eat forum report](https://eatforum.org/content/uploads/2019/07/EAT-Lancet_Commission_Summary_Report.pdf) 

As the world’s population is constantly rising, the cost of accommodating the animal based meat industry is going to be more and more difficult to justify.  Animal based meat industry also produces waste levels, that have been projected to be long term unsustainable as well as massively contributing towards global warming.  According to multiple studies, plant based meat industry is projected to take up to 60% of the international meet market by 2040. 

[Plant based meat in 2040](https://m.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/slaughter-free-is-the-future-cultured-meat-will-dominate-long-term-while-plant-based-products-continue-to-disrupt-predicts-new-report.html)

That would be a massive number.  Given the fact that $BYND is a major player and has a very long history and solid R+D base, it gives me enough confidence to invest for long term. It is going to take a long time to start-ups and new emerging companies to get any close to where $BYND is at the moment.  I am confident, that with time they will come up with better and less heavily processed products as every industry evolves to meet market demands and requirements.   

Therefore, I would not listen to short term antagonising trends speaking about the surprisingly low revenue during COVID affected quarters and lowering returning customer base...  It is all affected by this crisis and upon a recovery, this company will take off!  I believe that the bigger picture is the way to go here and in any other financial decision.  BTW have you ever tried any of their products? I have and they are actually really good! :)   

Of course, this is my humble opinion only. I hope we can agree somewhere along the way!

Sometimes it appreciates 2 cents which is 15-20% and I think "man, if I only had put $100k in there".  But at the end of the day, would $100k completely effect the course of the investment given the entire volume is 622.49K?

So I’ve been investing for years, but always passively, money into my 401(k) and Roth IRA. I took advantage of Apple’s split back in August and scooped up nearly 100 shares.

That being said, since I’ve never just outright owned stock, I’m wondering if I should put in stop/loss points to save my current gains? Or if the plan is to go long, just accept that it will dip and eventually recover? Again, when it comes to reading stocks, my knowledge is limited and I don’t sit around watching candlesticks.

We direct investments for a private investment group.

In  order to avoid insider trading, We will publish  any information We receive about Cleartronics (CLRI) used to make  investing decisions before any additional purchases are made. 

1. It is public record that the company’s earning for 2018 were approximately -500K;  for 2019 approximately -250K (loss); showing a year over year improvement. 
2. It  is common knowledge to those involved in or working for the company  (spoke to multiple employees) that the company’s earnings are MOST  LIKELY GOING TO BE PROFITABLE for 2020. 
3. The  company’s earnings have been improving; they are just starting to turn  profitable; there is a significant market for its products / services,  especially in the Covid-19 environment; we believe that now is the time  to buy. 
4. The  company is growing. After speaking with the company’s President, Marc  Moore, we learned the company has been focusing internally during the  last several years to establish the viability of its core product line.  That having been established, they are positioned to now more  aggressively market and grow the company. 
5. The  ReadyOp service fills a large, untapped niche market need, servicing  organizations from The FBI and Emergency Responders to the FDA to  NASCAR. Once an organization sees the effectiveness of the service  provided, they need very little additional selling to close the deal and  become a long-term customer; ReadyOp becomes a staple, filling a need  that no other product/service is designed to meet, particularly in a Covid-19 environment.
6. The product line generates annual subscription revenues that grow every year. 
7. The  President claims plans for a stock buyback strategy. Due to mergers and  acquisitions necessary to establish the company’s core businesses, an  abundance of shares have been issued, though the vast majority (over  approximately 75%) are held by insiders / long term investors. The  company plans a stock repurchase program in the near future to reduce  the number of outstanding shares. 
8. In  short, we believe this company has reached critical mass and is poised  for expansion. Now is time to “get in on the ground floor” or a growing  company. In our opinion, this is the next penny stock that will become a  500 million dollar company. 

We currently own stock in the company and plan to purchase more... after this article is public.

They became known for their Covid tests but I wouldn't call them "a Covid company".

Fulgent is a healthcare company provid-ing genetic testing for single-gene muta-tions, rare diseases, and whole-genome sequencing.   They constantly improve its product offerings and now sells tests to examine more than 18,000 single genes and more than 800 rare diseases. 

All their software and lab management systems are developed in house, they're a technology company. Their great testing capability allowed them to start testing for Covid as soon as the pandemic started. They started to provide testinf for Covid and that brought money. In Q3 2020 their revenue rose about 900%. 

One may think that their business is gone when Covid goes away but I strongly disagree. First, unfortonately Covid is here to stay and because of that they just extended their contract with NYC for test and trace for school year 2021. Second, the Covid testing brought them many new clients. Despite all the postponing visits to the doctor across 2020, their genetics testing business (their core business) grew 57%, courtesy of new costumers brought by the Covid testing.

So, when the pandemic goes away they will have a much larger client base and a lot more contracts in their bag.

 Looking at their fundamentls, they grew almost 300% this year but I think there's still a lot room to grow. Their PE ratio is only 23,74, market cap is only 1,23B and they are debt free and after this year they will have a mature business with an increased clients base and a lot of money so I won't be surprised if by 2021 EOY we have a run simillar to the 2020 one._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is JD so undervalued versus its peers like PDD and BABA?

I wasn't sure if this is focused enough to post this outside of the daily questions, but I figured I'd do it anyways so I'm sorry if I'm violating anything here.

I have an issue that I seemed to be unable to find the answer to with my own research. I want to be a dividend investor, and eventually hit a goal of around 12,000 a year in dividends. It might be a crack dream or something but I want to be able to retire early and live off my streams of income, dividends being one of them of course.

I know how Roth IRAs work overall, but there's a grey area for me that isn't really clarified in terms of how dividends are handled. If I were to use M1 Finance for my Roth IRA, for example, am I allowed to stop the reinvestment of dividends once I meet that threshold of dividend income? (I know I probably won't hit it with only 6k contributions a year). Or is it pointless to do it inside of a Roth IRA, and should I just build my dividend portfolio outside of one?

It is worth it to move the funds to something like SWNTX or VTEAX or just keep it where it is?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best ways to invest in gold? 1.  Aside from bullion coins, how else could I invest in gold? ETF’s, if so which ones. 

2.  Say the USD crashes, that means even my investment in a gold ETF would be worth nothing correct? I’d have to sell to cash out. At that point I guess it’s maybe not the best gold option? 

Trying to think out the box._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on shifting to larger investing I have always believed that investing in an index fund is the best plan - but at what point do people think one should invest outside of just stocks? For example if one had a million in index stocks (including international) and 600k in rental properties- where would you invest another 400k-500k. Would you just keep investing it in stocks? Would you consider another rental property? Is there another option that you would consider?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it simply a bad time to look into CDs now? 2 years ago, a lot of CD ladders had 3-4% APYs and I was looking to start one with Citizens Access but chose not to for personal reasons. Now that I’m finally ready, I see they’re all at 0.50 - 1% - is it just a bad time right now?

All signs seem to point to INTC divesting it's fabs like AMD did with GloFo.  What was once Intel's greatest strength has now becomes it's greatest liability in terms of the fabrication 

There is supposedly some announcement coming in January, and I'm wondering if this is it. I can't get a feel on how should play it.  I would not invest in INTC "long term" as I think the company as a whole (fab + design engineering) is far from saving at this point, so was wanting to do a "short term" play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dollar General Sees Increase in Super Saturday Foot Traffic as Most Retailers Slump The dollar store chain had a 1.3 percent gain in foot traffic on Super Saturday, which fell on Dec. 19, compared to 2019, despite COVID-19 keeping shoppers out of stores this holiday season, Placer.ai data shows.

Of the 10 retailers Placer.Ai tracked during Super Saturday — Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Ross, Marshalls, Macy’s, JCPenney, T.J. Maxx and Kohl’s — Dollar General was the only one to see an increase compared to last year.

What are some of the companies, or ETFs in these areas that you think are good bets.  These areas I believe are still relatively young and have huge potential for growth. I have looked at iRobot and Blue Prism (with UIPath becoming public soon). 

I know Google and Microsoft are the biggest in the AI space but their stock is pretty high right now and already own them though ETFs.

I don’t know if you heard the news, but the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) set rules for piloting small drones. Amazon has been testing drones since 2013 and plan on using them as a new form of delivery. UPS and Google are also looking to commercialize using drones for their delivery services. Soon more and more companies might follow. What do you think this means for investors? Do you think now is a good time to invest in drone manufacturing companies?

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396621-altimmune-adcovids-potential-to-prevent-transmission-may-be-key-to-ending-pandemic](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396621-altimmune-adcovids-potential-to-prevent-transmission-may-be-key-to-ending-pandemic)

Interesting read

Key points:

* Altimmune's (ALT) valuation is at a discount after the recent sell-off, and the fundamental picture has improved with more clarity around manufacturing.
* ALT has added new high-profile biotech investors on board, and institutional investors hold 75% of the float. This means the stock could potentially run 100-200% higher with a catalyst.
* AdCOVID has all the characteristics that WHO is looking for: sterilizing immunity (prevention of infection and transmission), safety, a single-dose administration, intranasal route of administration, and room temperature storage.
* The OWS vaccines do not prevent "transmission" and may not abate this pandemic. As such, COVID-19 may linger until the approval of an effective vaccine that can induce sterilizing immunity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Georgia Election/Senate Outcome 
Georgia’s Jan 5 run-off election will determine if the U.S. Senate swings dem (with VP Harris acting as the tie-breaker) or stays in control of the GOP. 

With the dems already in control of the House and WH, swinging the Senate will shift to a more liberal governing body that could influence a bevy of factors in financial markets (eg taxes, trade, etc)

How are you trading/investing based on potential outcomes?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cryptocurrencies as part of an investment portfolio? Hi,

this is going to be controversial but I need some feedback on my investing plan:

1. Convince me why I should or should hold any Cryptocurrency 
2. If "yay crypto" 
   1. what is your composition 
   2. ...and allocation
   3. How often do you rebalance the crypto?

My investing allocation is currently 60% stocks (low-cost ETFs ), 5% crypto, and the rest a mix of bonds (also ETF) and cash.

I know the crypto part is controversial. I am just holding ETH,  BTC, and LTC (33% each). But I am considering to diversify more in the next year.

In my opinion, a small percentage of in crypto 3-10% (depending on your risk appetite) is a totally legit way of diversifying your portfolio. Since the volatility is so high I tend to not pay too much attention and just rebalance once every two months or so.

The market capitalization of cryptos like Bitcoin or Etherium is quite high and financial institutions are participating in the market. It's recognized and regulated by federal institutions. So the risk is not that much. different than dealing in small-cap equities or junk bonds

thx for your feedback!

PS: I am very new to Reddit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Rover analysis software?? So after finally realizing how much time I waste on trying to get my scripts to accurately scrape the financial data I need in order to create my models for performing security analysis ( which eats up more time ) and continuing to scroll through multiple websites to find the financial data I need . I have happened to stumble across the software otherwise known as StockRover. The premium annual payments isn’t bad at all for what all it seems to include . With that being said , I’m curious as to how good the accuracy would be when dealing with their ratios . Such as d/e , peg, etc..... is their any former investor out there who has tested the data thoroughly from this software ? The only con that I can find with the software is the obvious ( to much) information which leads to as we all know ( analysis paralysis ) . So with all of that being said . For those that have used it , what are y’all’s opinions ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
