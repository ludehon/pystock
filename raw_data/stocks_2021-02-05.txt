Q4 2020 Highlights, compared to prior year

* Revenue was $238.2 million, a decrease of 26% or $84.6 million, reflecting the absence of the Company’s large-scale event in Saudi Arabia and ticketed live events
* Operating income was $36.2 million, a decrease of 64% or $63.6 million
* Adjusted OIBDA1 was $51.2 million, a decrease of 52% or $56.4 million
* WWE transitioned Raw and SmackDown to Tropicana Field in Tampa Bay (December 11), and continued to deliver a spectacular interactive experience, WWE ThunderDome, to fans
* WWE Network average paid subscribers2 were 1.5 million, an increase of 6%

The company said it expected a "significant" increase in its expense base this year, "due to the return of employees from furlough and continued higher expenses associated with the production of its weekly Raw and SmackDown television content at the WWE ThunderDome from its stadium residence."

Analysts are largely sticking with Buy ratings. Evercore ISI's John Belton says the firm thinks investors will be "a bit disappointed by some of management’s comments around both higher than expected expense growth expectations beyond this year and the confusing nature of the Peacock agreement” - referring to the company's move to make the NBCUniversal streaming service its exclusive content home.

Needham's Laura Martin noted that lower OIBDA estimates for 2021 despite higher over-the-top revenue in the Peacock deal is a testament to the higher costs expected. But she notes the Peacock deal lowers revenue risk for several years to come, and raises her price target to **$65** from $50 (**now implying 30% upside**).

Guggenheim went better than that, reiterating its Buy rating and **$72** price target (**44% upside**). 

Berenberg is pointing to the Peacock deal and the push towards de-networking sports content as justifications to stick with its buy rating; it has a **$64** target.

My position: 50 @ .WWE210219C50_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TTCF as a investment The Tattooed Chef is a plant based company that sells frozen foods in retailers like Costco, Walmart and Sams club. The US frozen food market is worth about 55 billion and the Tattoed Chef is trying to disrupt the market with quality foods that are plant based. A big part of this change is coming through the Millennial generation and Genration Z . The average millennial and Gen Z cannot cook, so what do they do take out and frozen foods. But with more of a focus on vegan and plant based foods. This is where the Tattooed Chef comes out to shine. The average man spends 290 $ at the grocery store and for women it is 323 $. How large is the Millennial and Z generation in a America you ask? 133 million Americans large and if they spend per say 20 dollars each for frozen foods that are plant based based. That is around 2,6 billion usd of revenue for the TTCF.

What does the Tattooed Chef have that the Very Good Food Company and Beyond Meat BYND doesn't ? The ability to have innovative products with a potential of 62 SKUs in 2021 and they are targeting around 200 SKUs. They are vertically integrated meaning that they own all forms of manufacturing and idea sharing. They can go from idea in to market in 3 days. They have all types of frozen foods in their products such as Single Serve Bowls, Smoothie Bowls , Vegetable Blends , Meat alternatives and Plant powered Pizzas. They have also launched a European commerce site as it will draw in new customers fromm all over the US.

They currently have 200k space of manufacturing room. They doubled in 2020 and will double in 2021 in manufacturing room. They are ramping up production as they are on target to reach 62 different SKUs. They have a plant in Italy and a plant in California the Italy plant will especially be good for European expansion in 2024. Their Certifications are on another level they have all of the organic seals of approval from the USDA.

Their Revenue increased 87% year o year from 2019 to 2020. It went from 58.1 Mil to 108.9 Million in 2020. Their gross profit also increased 70% from 9.9 Million to 16.8 Million in 2020. The adjusted EBITDA went up from 4.7% with a percentage of sales of 8.1%. It went up to 10.6% of total sales of 9.7%. They have not launched their Ad council yet but it should again help with total sales. Their predicted revenue of 2021 is 222 million which is almost a 100 percent raise of revenue. In 2022 their revenue should be 300 million with a Gross margin of 25 - 30 %. In 2023 it should be 500 million of revenue with as total margin of 30 to 35 %. In 2026 is the killer year with a predicted revenue of 1 billion with total margins of 35% plus. The adjusted EBITDA should be 20 % as of 2026 and in 2021 it should be in the main teens.

As of Q3 of 2020 their total assets were 66,718 million with 56,550 million of total liabilities.They recently exercised a warrant for 230 million worth of cash and it puts them at 296,718 million usd. There P/S is about 13.04. They have a forward P/E of 309.25. Based on these statics with a P/S of 13.04 and with a 2021 revenue of 222 million there market cap should be 2,894,88 billion which is almost a billion more in market cap. My price target 12 months from now should be 38-45 USD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I'm bullish on CuriosityStreams (CURI) CuriosityStream (CURI) is a streaming provider of fact-based entertainment content (including television shows, documentaries, and short clips). It is run by the founder of Discovery and was recently taken public. The material is reminiscent of when Discovery hosted quality content in the 90s / early 2000s.

Their streaming product does not include any external media and thus they are not subject to the high costs of acquiring licenses for additional content.

CURI has partnered with Amazon Prime and Apple TV to add CURi as a paid channel, seamlessly attracting millions of new viewers.

They have shown YoY revenue growth of 90%, and although advertising spend seems high recently I expect this to continue to grow. While Disney+ is great for children, parents are going to want more educational content.

At the end of 2020, CURI had over 13M users. With a price point of only $12/yr., I don't see this slowing down anytime soon as they continue to get their name out to the public.

I recently opened a small position in CURI last week at $17 and plan to continue adding on the dips._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shorting stocks - two ways? EToro user here and I'm confused about shorting. In eToro if you short a stock at price 100 and the stock goes to 150 the trade is closed and you lose 50% of your investment (you can add funds to keep it open but those are irrelevant details). But a few days ago I learned that people just short the stock and pay 30% of its value per year just to hold them, the stock can go up 500% percent and all you have to do is wait for it to go back down... These seem two fundamentally different shorting techniques. What's the deal? Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARK alternative ETFs for Europeans? EU laws prohibit Europeans to invest in US ETFs and therefore gives me no chance to buy any ARK funds.

Are there any ETFs with a similar approach to ARK?

I am especially inrerested in ARKK and ARKG.

Thank you very much in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So just picked up 23 shares of LUV... Might even grab some more in the comming week's. Strictly a 4-6 month swing trade as i generally don't like airline stock's. Seems to still have some recovery room going into the summer. Wouldnt expect a huge bump. Maybe 10-15%. 

The airlines treated me well last year, hoping for a repeat. Anyone else playing this position? Or another airline?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TD Ameritrade margin balance? Hi so I’ve recently transferred from rh to td ameritrade and after my stocks transferred to td my account is showing I have a margin balance even though I used cash to buy all of my positions. Should I be worried or is this normal & it’ll resolve on its own within a few days? (The cash in my rh account hasn’t been transferred to td yet so I’m not sure if it has something to do with that)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Possible buy: DKNG  

Yes yes yes, i know, I'm very late to DKNG, i have thought about buying in the past months but it had seemed like the stock has been on a bull run all year that would undoubtedly face a massive correction. Although now I'm thinking that draft kings still has a lot of growth to offer. What finally pushed me over the edge was ARK buying more shares, I'm a huge fan of ark so I'm very biased with what they do, but this just added to why i think i like DKNG. Also with the NFL viewership rising steadily in the past few years, As well as new fans from the quarantine emerging this could lead to a possible download surge, which in turn will boost the stock.

Positions - I currently hold no DKNG shares, i plan on buying as soon as it drops to my range of below 60, the main reason it spike from 54 was because of ARK and I think it will dip soon.

If your interested in Ziptraders video on DKNG: (I had a link here but it got taken down, its his second most recent video)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) - Massively Undervalued Growth Stock Regeneron Pharmaceuticals just reported Q4 and FY20 earnings today and I very surprised at how the market is failing to correctly value this company. Revenues for 2020 came in at $8.5B with earnings of $3.5B. Revenues represented 30% YoY growth while earnings' growth was 66% YoY. **The company is currently trading at around a 15 P/E Ratio (market cap $53B) and is expected to grow revenues another 25% or more next year.** Regeneron also has $6.7B in cash on their balance sheet and just announced a new share repurchase program of $1.5B. I am not seeing any red flags with this stock. 

To me, I see almost no downside risk to investing in this company, but I am struggling to figure out why the market isn't valuing this stock higher. Despite nearly tripling its earnings in the past 3 years, the stock price is still trading at its peak 2017 price of around $500. I would be interested to hear any counterpoints to my analysis or an explanation as to why this stock is not reflecting a higher price and if it is worth investing in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DOCU stock. Worth it or not? Their stock shot up around the pandemic as no one wanted to sign anything in person and since seems to have stabilized around the $250 mark. Is it a good idea to jump into something that seems pretty stable like that?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APD very attractive long value They didn't give guidance this earnings and it led to a big drop, very attractive entry point well under fair value. I initiated my position before and plan to average down. Many plants under construction and any new guidance will be a positive catalyst for this stock. 

They do industrial gases and plan on being a huge green hydrogen producer in the future. A good safe way to gain green energy exposure without the sky high valuations on most of the pumped up stocks in my opinion. CEO has a great track record of increasing value to shareholders and they also have many opportunities in emerging markets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unable to trade options in rh I can’t trade options with a certain stock in RH (please don’t say anything with the boycott or whatever, that’s another discussion). 

I checked an ETF i’m currently in, and it allows me to select Trade Options. 

But on another ticker it does not show me that option, is there something they are limiting again or what is going on ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I want to invest in 5G, should I join Motley Fool Market Pass? Hello, I have recently gotten into learning about stock trading, probably the hardest I've tried learning anything in my life.

Yes, GME is what pulled me into this world in the first place. But I do not think I will be investing into GME now (it looks like I would have had to do that a year or two ago to have gotten a huge return this year, like DeepF\*\*\*ingValue.

But, I figured it'd be worth it to try and learn about the stock market and invest the traditional way. Yes, slow growth insanely infuriates me (I'm a 25 year old and feel my whole life has been a waste, and not looking forward to decades more of misery, and/or the traditional work until 60 or 70 and then retire path) but 5G is going to be a MASSIVE gamechanger.

I personally believe in it (I LOVE self driving cars and AI, I'm a HUGE fan of these things) and 2021 has just started, and Apple has already released a 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12. But the massive life and societal transform of 5G hasn't even begun.

I want to make up for my lost youth (\*sigh\*, even if the money won't come in until my 30s, maybe I can somehow make the best of it until then, I don't know, I have a lot of issues and circumstances straining my life) and also prove to my family that I CAN be successful. I don't want my two options to be live with them forever or end up homeless. 

I don't have real time to get myself set up for a career, I'm losing my health insurance in a year. I can try to get some better entry level job that provides that, I guess. I do desperately want out of this house. But I need my own stability. 

Also, if I get rich, I can give to the poor, which will give my life meaning, like Mr. Beast.

I don't need to profit as much as possible. I'd keep $10-$20 million MINIMUM to my name at all times if I made it that high (for security against inflation and economic crash coming) and give wealth to those suffering, the homeless, young adults whose parents kept them in the house and not let them go get a job, I'd give them a nice 5 or 6 figure to get out and go live.

I realize I'm shooting high, but I'm (not rock bottom, yet) very low, so why wouldn't I reach high?

5G is a HUGE opportunity, and I'm a big believer in advancing technology. I'm NOTHING like my family, I'm VERY pro-technology and pro-technology.

I do want to enjoy my own wealth, but to ALSO share it. I believe everyone should receive a basic living allowance, while I may not be able to do that, I could certainly give to those in dire need if I was a multimillionaire, definitely as a multibillionaire.

This isn't JUST about me, but others, especially those worse off than me. The world owes me nothing, and I owe nobody else anything? Screw that rule, I feel it is my responsibility to get rich and give to others, it will also mean my life has a purpose.

Alternatively, even not getting rich, but more in the thousands, could still mean pursuing higher education, affording my healthcare, and paying bills and rent more easily to transition to my full financial independence (above poverty).

I realize my wording may seem kind of odd, but I'm trying my best to type out how I feel.

I already spent $430.84 for \*Stock Advisor\* and \*Rule Breaker\*, so they are giving me a discount (they apply credit you already spent to discount another subscription). Instead of $999 for \*Market Pass\* it will be $571.70. 

Yes, I don't make a lot ($1,200 a month, or less) but I'm desperate to achieve financial independence, and might not have much time to do so (lots of instability and dysfunction at home). I'm also just ready to get a f\*cking life and enjoy it after 25 years of being miserable. I don't want to rely on poverty or welfare programs or whatever, if I'll even qualify for that. I'm very determined to not have to suffer anymore years. Especially since I could lose insurance to pay for my medications after this year.

I certainly feel I'm better off spending hundreds, even thousands, investing into stocks that will bring me wealth, than spending it all on the lottery, because that was becoming my next plan before I feel my only option left is to, end my life._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 3D Printing: A bubble of hype or actual growth? So I don't see much talking about this around here but I was doing my weekly check up on DDD after missing it at $10 when my mom told me to buy it :). Looking at a few 3D printing stocks, DDD, SSYS, PRLB, DM notably, they all tend a very strong upwards trend. Out of these, which out of these do you think has the most potential and why? Either way, I think 3D printing is definitely a long term hold. As we know, 3D printing has been nothing new, but what are the short term catalyst that are causing them to spike?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Heres why DBX is an insane value play right now:  

to start with their balance sheet:

 

* $1.1 Billion is cash and investments.
* ZERO long term debt (this is uncommon in the tech growth space, especially the cloud sector) . 
* With all this cash on the BS  you are technically only paying \~ $7 Billion for a $9 Billion public market value. 
* 25 forward PE which is crazy low when you look at the growth potential and compare to competitors premium in the space (most trade in the 100 - 1,000). 

Market cap of $9 Billion 

DPX is cheaper than when it went IPO

It is undervalued compared to cloud computing competitors.

Hellosign acquisition undervalued compared to competitor of $DOCU which is worth $45 Billion On its own. 

$DBX should be trading 4x higher than it is currently based on the premium other investors are paying for competitors in the space 

 

* Large short float (7.4%) meaning squeeze potential as upper long term resistance is tested on volume, Stops will get triggered. 
* Relatively low float and market cap meaning it wouldn't take a lot of volume for this stock to trade 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% higher on a day with big news. Low supply of shares with high demand will cause price to go up. 
* Not many cash flow positive business have float structures this luctrave. 
* They are unlikely to sell new shares to the public if it does gap up as they already have lots of cash on the balance sheet and a cash flow positive business model. **Low risk of share dilution.**   

 

* Closest competitor to Hellosign market cap of $45 Billion 
* This is 4x the size of $DBX which is at $9 Billion. Hellosign could grow to the size of $DOCU. 
* $DBX has a big potential $DOCU competitor with already great business and growing e-workspace business. 
* You are paying a cheaper premium for $DBX and it has more growth potential and is already profitable.

  

* The selling pressure from $DBX has stopped and insiders and institutions are setting up long positions to play value tech.
* $DBX has begun to break trend and outperform major markets.
* Options activity on the 1 year chain shows a substantial long bias with traders accumulating calls.
* $DBX will gain sympathy from a strong IPO market, cloud computing market, and tech market. 
* Investors who missed $DOCU 560% YTD run will look to add  $DBX due to the HelloSign acquisition.
* Relative rotation shows capital is flowing out of large cap technology into value tech.
* Institutions have increased their positions by 50,000,000 shares. 
* **Institutions own 84% of $DBX**
* A total of 463 institutions hold $DBX  and 217 of them have recently added to their holdings.
* There are 60 new holders who recently accumulated a total of 11,675,563 shares during the long term channel on the daily chart. 
* There has only been 7,766,483 shares sold by institutions during this trading channel.
* This signals institutions are net long $DBX on a break of this channel and will look to add momentum lots to their position 
* **My price target is $40-$ 200 per share in the next 2-3 years**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does one go about buying fractional shares? I am interested in buying fractional shares of multiple stocks.

With all of the news about the semiconductor shortages and trade agreements, I started digging into the companies like $TSM. One that stood out was $ON Semiconductors due to their automotive sector revenue and recent changes of the guard (New CFO and VP of Operations/Manufacturing and 2 new board members) All of the new guard have a track record of cutting costs and improving revenue and manufacturing.

* Blackrock purchased a 6.9% stake less than a week ago
* Janus Henderson Group purchased a 4.9% stake less than a month ago

Peloton released its latest earnings last night, and is of course firing on all cylinders ( [dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549 (onepeloton.com)](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549) ) I have a position in Peloton so I might be biased, but I like every single line in the earnings report. Some of my personal highlights:

* Continued top-line (128%) and bottom-line growth (6% unadjusted net profit margin - worth noting that the company has at least doubled revenue every year of its existence, even before Covid).
* Monthly churn of 0.76%. It's hard to overstate how stellar this is, especially for a company targeting individuals. Netflix churn rate is between 2-3% currently (the lowest it has ever been, while other streaming competitors hover between 4-10%).
* Each additional member has fantastic contribution margins thanks to their platform business. 
* Members complete an average of 21 workouts per month. Not the sign of a dissatisfied customer base (Net Promoter Score is 90).
* They continue innovating with new products and classes (Pilates, strength training, Tread, pre-recorded session) at a much faster pace than their competition
* Fantastic reviews for the company culture ( [Peloton Company Culture | Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/companies/peloton) ) which helps them continue to attract top talent, further fueling innovating and product growth, resulting in happy customers. Just in January 2021, they have hired new VPs for:
   * IT and Supply Chain (from Juul Labs and AWS)
   * Talent Management (former Amazon HR Director)
   * Software Architecture (ex Facebook and Google)
   * Executive Development (former Starbucks)
   * Global Brand Marketing (former WeWork - I know, I know, but you can't deny that the WeWork branding was on point)
   * Content (ex ESPN)
   * Platform (ex Spotify)
* International opportunity is just beginning. It's already one of the top ranked fitness apps in Germany and UK, and they have many more countries they can expand into

Their story reminds me a lot of Netflix, who have built up a highly competitive platform with great financials despite a huge increase in competition. Peloton's competitors are barely just getting started and I don't see them catching up.

I want to put more money in this company, but would be great to hear some contrarian opinions. Bonus points if you write more than "it's a fad" or "they will crash when Covid is over"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone help me understand the 30 day rule of a wash sale? Scenario - Let’s say I bought 5 shares of a stock for a price of $100. Two days later I bought 3 more shares when the price of the stock went down to $75 and then the next day I bought another 2 shares of the same stock when the price went down to $50. 

So now I hold 10 shares of the stock with a cost average of $82.5 per stock.

A week later I decide to sell half of those shares at a loss. How and why is this considered a wash sale?

I understand that a wash sale is when you buy —> sell —> buy a stock within 30 days. 

However I’m confused over the language of ‘30 days BEFORE or after a sale’. Does that mean if I sell a share that I’ve held for less than 30 days at a loss it counts as a wash sale and I can’t claim it in my tax returns? Even if I don’t buy the same stock again?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 50 stocks vs 10 stocks I've got a few core holdings that gone really well but I can't decide if I should hold around 10 stocks concentrated or just pick say ,30-40 more stocks. 

I like the idea of finding a lot of tenbaggers and spreading my risk a bit more.

However I also like the idea of Investing in my top ideas and really go big on those selected ones.

What's your take on a small portfolio vs a bigger one?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Extremely undervalued tech/clean energy stock with super cheap calls. $CLS Need to get some money back from 💎🙌 GME? I know I do. Now, before i get downvoted to hell, this is not an options-only play. I just happen to be buying calls cause it seems very undervalued to me, and the calls are cheap. You can 100% buy shares and do well.

I picked up 640 10c for feb 19. They were 5$ each. The stock is at 8.99 as im writing this and up .40$ from yesterdays low. These are cheap as shit. This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or r/options. So im mentioning it there in all 3. 

This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything, let alone short dated options. You dont have to buy them for this play, im just explaining how undervalued they are. 

10c for 3/19 (42 days) are $.20.
12.5c for 3/19 are $.10

*They have over 24,000 employees, brought in 5.88B revenue in 2019, and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide. Theyve been in business for 27 years. https://www.celestica.com/news/media-information

*Their most recent earnings, released jan 26, 2021, show an earnings of 0.16$ per share, as opposed to a loss of 0.05$ per share last year. This means that they were profitable during covid, and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies. 

*They have an “undrawn $450M revolver” as they put it on their site, or $464M in cash. https://corporate.celestica.com/static-files/e9830936-130f-44f6-9f73-3127402c00d5

So what do they do? Yes.

Celestica Inc.
Celestica inc. Is a provider of supply chain solutions. The company operates in electronics manufacturing services. The company offers a range of services to its customers, including design and development, engineering services, supply chain management, new product introduction, component sourcing, assembly and testing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, precision machining, order fulfillment, logistics and after-market repair and return services. Its products and services serve a range of applications, including servers, storage systems, optical equipment, aerospace and defense electronics, healthcare products and applications, semiconductor equipment, and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters. It designs, manufactures and tests solar panels for residential, commercial, and utility scale markets.

Im in this for the clean energy, innovative tech, supply chain, and aerospace. Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo.

We all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy(looking at you ICLN gang), and that its a main focus of many governments around the world. They have 6 locations in China, 2 locations in South Korea, and 3 locations in Japan. These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy. They also have 4 locations in California, and a few other locations throughout the US. Basically, theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation.

I can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs, including the new space one, ARKX.

Their linkedIn page is full of jobs, they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions. They pay their staff relatively well, (avg 60k per year with 32k/yr being minimum for warehouse staff.) The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of 3.5 stars on Glassdoor and 3.9 on indeed. Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit, which is very promising.

I dont know how to add pictures. 🚀🚀🚀
The only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation, there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre-covid. Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call. Before the march crash, the stock peaked at 9.29. At the bottom of the crash, it was trading at 2.63. Since then, they have rebounded back to over 9$ per share and are approaching pre-covid highs. Their 2019 earnings were negative 0.05$ per share, and their earnings for 2020 were $0.16 per share. Again, this means that they went from losing money pre-covid, to being profitable during.

Reasons I believe the stock is undervalued:
Very low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists, or that the company is dogshit. This company is not dogshit. A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B$/year in sales.

$CLS holds a P/E ratio of 8.86, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.83. 

$CLS has a P/B ratio of 0.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 
1.79. This alone makes them very undervalued.

$CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue, or sales. This is a useful metric on low volume/unheard of stocks, because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.31.

* CLS has a P/CF ratio of 5.83. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.35.

Please let me know if you find more/better information, or if something ive said is incorrect.

Edit 1: Found an interview with the CFO about which sectors of their business improved and declined in the last quarter, and some things they plan to do moving forward. If you dont want to watch it, their aerospace sector declined heavily due to grounded planes due to covid, while their cloud and data sector grew heavily and they expect it to continue to perform well. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada/video/we-are-well-positioned-to-benefit-from-the-buy-american-plan-celestica-cfo~2127135

Tldr: $CLS is a tech/clean energy company involved in many promising industries. They are undervalued in every sense of the word, and their options even more so. They have extemely low volume due to being unknown, but are by no means a dogshit penny stock. Stock is currently trading at 9.03, and 10c for 2 weeks out are $.05. Yesterday they opened at 8.73, found resitance at 8.60, and climbed to 8.95 at close. 

Positions (again): 640 x CLS 10c 2/19.       🪐

I am looking for some additional information sources when trying to find new growth opportunities. Ofc everyone knows Bloomberg, Google/YahooFinance, Reddit, Youtube, etc. But when trying to learn more about a growth sector/industry and related stocks, where do you get your information from? I am talking about spotting those stocks without knowing of them. Do you follow gurus, do you have "alerts" or something? Hope the question is not too confusing. 

In addition, can you recommend any newer books related to growth investing? Do not need to be "gamechanging" or bring a lot of new things to the table, but just well-written and interesting. Something like "One Up On Wall Street" or "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" but newer.

If you're like me, you probably hate when websites and apps don't have a dark mode available, especially for stocks, because I'm often doing research late and the eye strain is rough.

Anyway, Yahoo Finance (Web) doesn't have any sort of dark mode, and I really like the app (which does have dark mode) and watchlist/ability to link a brokerage, so I didn't want to stop using it. So I spent the day editing the CSS to make it work for me.

Using it is simple. I use [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) to add Custom CSS to webpages (works for Chrome/Firefox, not affiliated). It works for me, but feel free to use whatever extension you want. Just paste everything from that pastebin link above into the textbox for your CSS, and make sure it's being applied to [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com). You should now have a working dark mode, including charts, portfolio, news, screeners, markets, etc. I tried to find everything that looked wonky and fix it, but let me know if I missed anything (or feel free to just add to your own version). I left some comments in the code to explain what some sections are changing, in case you want to adjust the colors yourself or add other elements.

For anyone unfamiliar with CSS, this ain't any sneaky deaky hacky shit, you're not gonna get a virus. It's just styling for the webpage.

Anyway, it was useful for me so I thought I'd share it to save some eyeballs. Let me know if you find it useful._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much time to spend on research As much as possible i guess, but i really want to know:

With a huge wave of coming demand I wanted to look for opportunities in the periphery of EV’s.

So I have seen some articles and the talking heads have spoken about a coming EV battery shortage. There really don’t seem to be many EV battery producers. Tesla is a big one and they’re bringing in house. Lg is another (they are making batteries for Tesla).  

There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don’t see any companies that are focused on this.

There is an ETF $LIT. I’m not thrilled with it though.

So my thoughts lead me to EV battery material mining. With shortages this could be a good play but I’m not sure about long term potential.

£250 AGTC @ $4.31

£250 FUBO @ $49

AGTC and FUBO both have earning releases coming up quite soon. AGTC has gone from $4.31 to $5.05, are looking to do very well and yesterday were awarded First Place in the BioProcess International Reader's Choice Awards in Cell & Gene Therapies. Gene therapies use seems to be increasing and I don't imagine AGTC will fall drastically any time soon but say if their earnings report on February 12th wasn't as strong as expected I imagine there'd be a loss but if this company is doing well presumably you'd expect a fall but that fall should be short term, as long as the company continues to do well? Same goes for FUBO, there's is on the 2nd March but they've been doing very well.

I think we have all been overly inundated with facts pertaining to this problem, such as T+2, FTD's, or the fact that Citadel is not only a hedge fund but also a market maker (who could see a problem with that?). Clearly we need an entirely new system. The obvious solution is decentralized, blockchain markets with instantaneous settlement. Many people are probably aware that $OSTK has spent over $100 million developing such a thing, TZero (T+0). This is THE kryptonite (or should I say cryptonite) to the current Hedge Fund, HFT shorting manipulation bullshit that we have all seen.

I love that Hedge Funds irresponsibly lost billions to $GME and I have the utmost respect for the spirit of recent $GME investors but I see recent attempts at continuing to push $GME as some sort of giant slayer as misguided. After all, the company's core business has nothing to do with fighting the establishment. I love a good turnaround story but it's starting to come across a little bit like controlled opposition. From my perspective, they can tolerate $GME but they can't stand $OSTK. My reason for posting this is to bring awareness to what $OSTK has been doing well before $GME. I also believe the market and regulators will increasingly awaken to the value and problem solving of TZero and as such $OSTK price will benefit.

On a totally separate but related note, the core Overstock business has accomplished the turnaround that $GME is attempting to create. $OSTK earnings are on 2/24 and if they follow the recent trend of other large ecommerce players, it should be a blowout quarter. $OSTK reported $0.50 earnings per share for the last quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of ($0.23) by $0.73. The company earned $731.65 million during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $585.58 million. Its revenue for the quarter was up 110.8% compared to the same quarter last year. With this recent and sustainable return to profitability, as well as ecommerce trends, the company maintains a decent fundamental valuation without even considering the potential for TZero and Medici Ventures (other blockchain initiatives).

Overall what I see in $OSTK is what $GME investors want but don't know they already have. A brief history of $OSTK pulled from Wikipedia below highlights almost a decade of $OSTK fighting the same manipulation $GME was experiencing. Hence the creation of TZero.

" In February 2007, Overstock.com launched a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other large Wall Street firms, alleging a "massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme" involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total shares outstanding.\[63\] The lawsuit alleged that this had created "immense downward pressure" on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate professor of law and business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, "Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right." Fields said, Byrne's "best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged."\[64\] John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and "extremely unpromising."\[63\] Two members of the Overstock.com board of directors, John Fisher and Ray Groves, resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit.\[65\]\[66\]

**In December 2010, all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with Overstock for $4.4 million.**\[67\] That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. **The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case.**\[68\]

The RICO claim was dismissed at trial, and this was affirmed on appeal. **The claim against Goldman was dismissed but Goldman subsequently settled a refiled suit.** **Merrill finally settled for $20 million in 2016".**

TL;DR: $OSTK is what $GME is trying to be and the hedge funds hate them for it. Fought manipulation for almost a decade and ultimately received settlement offers from all of them. Now they have pivoted to overhaul the system from their own experience and I believe they should at the least be applauded for it. Disclosure I am long $OSTK_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Naked Short Selling, Failure to Deliver, and Short Interest - Who didn’t play by the rules? First, some terms (skip if you know them):

#What is naked shorting?

The *illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist. 

[Investopedia on Naked Shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

#What is Failure to Deliver?

Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (e.g. I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)

[Investopedia on failure to deliver ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

#What is Short Interest? 

The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (i.e. returned to the borrower) 

[Investopedia on short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)

#How are these terms related?

While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena, *there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock.
[Predictors for naked short selling manuscript ](http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/121208.pdf) 

Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.

#Was there naked short selling with GME?

Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.

[Source for securities threshold list ](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)
[Source for SEC’s regulations](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)

Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales &gt;50% of total sell volume)

[FINRA short volume ](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-index.html)

#What does this all mean?

It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it. 

#Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?

It’s a reopening play. It is the most similar stock/company to GameSt0p. It is very cheap. It’s new expansion in Europe is not priced in. Collectors are going nuts over Funko Pops due to stay at home. Prices for Pops are increasing. It is becoming the new beanie baby fad. Downside is limited but the upside is massive.**

**Sales trends have reversed and going up:** Funko saw a sharp drop in demand about a year ago. Hence the price dropped in anticipation of low demand. But that trend was temporary as you can see in google trends graph demand is back. So now it’s a cheap deep value stock that is poised to make a comeback. It’s cheap with lots of upside potential. At all time high it was $29.08. When it was selling less pops it was more expensive. Analysts haven’t realized that Funko sale trends have reversed. The price is suppressed due to being lumped into mall/retail business but Funko pivoted hard to ecommerce. I can't post google trends here, but just go to Google Trends and search "Funko". Set the parameters to 5 year trends worldwide.

**Collectibles are back:**

We saw the price of Pokemon cards, Silver, used games, and collectible stamps go up during pandemic. The stock price for GameSt0p, Collectors Universe, et st has gone up. Funko has all the same characteristics but because it’s a smaller company no one really woke up to its potential.

**Ecommerce expansion in Europe:**

European payment processors are reporting high transaction volume in regards to Funko. This made me clue in to the increased demand driven by e-commerce. Most analysts are using USA data but the is missing a major part of the expansion plans that Funko set in motion in 2019 and became fruitful in the second half of 2020.

**Reopening stocks are poised to outperform:**

If you are not interested in any other thesis about the company a simple sector rotation is the only reason many need to buy this retailer. Will the malls open in 3-4 month? Yes. So this will jump back up to its previous levels just by the virtue of that fact.

**Great collaborations:**

Need I say more? **Disney** has been killing it and their pops are produced by Funko. [funko.com](https://funko.com/)

**New Fad of collecting Pops: (This is the new Beanie Babies)**

A world record was set just recently for collecting Pops that is posted on YouuTube

The most impressive is that 1.7 million people viewed the video. This brings attention to the hobby of collecting pops and people who were buying little have started buying more. Prices for out of production lots have started going up.

**The trends for Funko on google shops show a very clear uptake in demand.**

**Analysts are waking up to the trend:**

Funko had a sell/hold rating just last month. Look what’s happening. Now it has a Strong buy/Buy rating. The price is going to reflect this soon.

**GameSt0p Similarities:**

GameSt0p sells Funko Pops and have full shelves dedicated to this. People are going to go to GameSt0p more and Funko will benefit from increased foot traffic. Buying Funko now is like buying GameSt0p when it was below $5. Profits are made before the run up starts. The run up on Funko is starting now. It has taken the first step of it’s spirit to new all time highs. Funko is the most similar company and stock to GameSt0p.

So my question is, am I doing good? Or did I take the concept of portfolio diversity a little too far? Should I condense, or am I doing things properly? I feel like my list is so long considering a lot of those at the bottom are only $100-400 holdings. 

I didn't really have much thought put into my ETFs beyond tech and green energy TBH. But I know the ones I picked are solid. I think ETFs are 60% of my portfolio? I just bought a ton of ones that fit my needs. 

I did do some research on my smaller holdings, though. Some stuff (DIS/WMT) is because it's invincible and won't crash unless the world crashes, some stuff (CMPS, VWDRY) is kind of risk but I'm cushioned and have small holdings, some of it I became familiar through Reddit (BB, Betz, DKNG), then the rest are just solid companies that I have faith in (SNAP, UA, SQ)

I know I'm holding for a full year. I think I'm going to end up divesting during 2022 to start a mortgage, though.

TDA is very transparent with all this stuff, they have option of selecting which visa do I have and details of it. Meaning they understand my situation.

My position: 50 @ 9.65_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Creating my own index fund. I've just started investing recently (1-2 weeks).

I like the idea of managing my own individual stocks, as a hobby, while being at the same time a conservative investor who would like to keep the risk as low as possible (I have zero urge to gamble and I don't feel any FOMO usually).

I'm investing mainly in the big tech and trade companies (safe for the most part, or I think) and to a lesser degree in many smaller companies (or higher risk companies but some potential for higher reward later on).

I'm not cashing out anytime soon as my monthly income is $15-20k post taxes depending on how hard I work so I don't really need the money anytime soon and I'll keep investing monthly in the stocks ~$5k. 

I would like to save enough and buy a condo to start a real estate business on the side but I'm still to study this in greater details, main deterant to the idea being having to deal with tenants.

I am thinking of taking NERD and BETZ down a few % and increasing QQQJ, but other than that, what should I change? Am I way off the reservation here? Too diversified? I am trying to keep this $10,000 to more high growth potential investments while my other assets sit in a more stable environment.

Whether that was the downward catalyst or not I’m not positive, but I’m convinced the current LZB price is undervalued. AMWD experienced a similar sell off around 1/25 further convincing me this is an short blip down in the industry rather than a La-z-boy problem. Supply chain problems have been the big hurdle for this industry to overcome but those have largely resolved over the last few months now that Asian lockdowns have relaxed thus boosting manufacturing and shipping volumes. Back at home the furnishings sector has done phenomenal lately for those that can deliver on their orders.

Earnings may provide a catalyst but I suspect this is a decent long term value play too right now.

**“Seems more likely that android auto or whatever apple comes up with takes over as they are more familiar to consumers and have already proven wildly successful”**

This is a comment I got on one of the Blackberry DD posts, It made me decide to read more and stop being emotional in how I support the company's progress. I decided to analyze all bear cases I receive Blackberry.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html)

"Millions of Ford vehicles will run Google's Android operating system starting in 2023"

This the Ford and Google press release title from CNN. 

First of all, very bold for Ford to assume they are going to be selling millions of cars in 2023. Their top seller is the F150 is going to banned from sales in most of the developed world during this decade. This is a different argument for later, my argument here is how the press release was made.

This press release is kind of desperate. If your sales estimate is the first part of your statement and not the new technology you are announcing, then this is a stock pumping press release. 

On the contrary, Here is the Blackberry announcement 3 months ago announcing that they signed a deal with Ford that paved the way to integrate Android into the system. 

[http://www.qnx.com/news/pr\_6294\_1.html](http://www.qnx.com/news/pr_6294_1.html)

It’s a very technical press release. It’s very professional, what you expect to see from an engineering company announcing a deal. They didn’t say “Billions to be generated from a new deal with Ford”.

&#x200B;

**With no pumping, What is the Ford and Android deal exactly?**

That means future Fords will feature Sync systems that use Google Maps and Android's excellent voice recognition, as well as opening up the platform to third-party developers. Ford will also use Google Cloud for its connected services, and the two companies will collaborate "to create new experiences for customers."

This is basically replacing the Sync 3 plus app. Android has an app already to sync your phone with the car. It’s like Chromecast for the car. The new announcement is basically saying that the sync3 app is going to be built-in inside the car. You can use it to open maps and have your other apps on and use an android voice assistant. Which exactly what 

The car is still going to use QNX. Android can’t control car electronics. It’s a very sophisticated real-time processing of sensor data. 

QNX controls the electronics of the F35 fighter jets. QNX was on the livery of Petronas Mercedes F1 car. Can you imagine how sophisticated it is to control the electronics of the fastest piece of machinery on earth?  You can literally change the engine map while driving on 350 km/hour. 

The good thing is that Blackberry responded. The company is paying attention to the people and keeps on assuring them. Blackberry posts regularly now on Twitter.

I'm fairly new to investing in stocks hands on (I briefly owned a mutual fund index thingy 15 or so years ago).

On one of my first few trades, I lucked out on a biotech company, Cassava Sciences. Made a nice profit, and still hold a position (albeit with a slight loss).

Out of exuberance, I decided to try do repeat the same thing on a penny stock; Anavex.  It's another biotech that has a drug in phase II trials that appears a good candidate for fast tracking by the FDA to the market.   So I bet on it at $24.81 x 10 shares.

Welp, of course, I'm learning my lesson.  So, as I learn my lesson, I'm wondering:  Do I sell and take the loss, or hold?  Because I'm not a pumper/dumper.  I intend to buy into companies/stocks that I believe in.  And I believe in this company.  So it's at $13.10 now, do I buy a bunch more stocks at this price while taking the loss on the 24$ position?   How do people deal with this kind of mistake?  This is not a critical make/break decision. I'm down about $120 (which is pennies to me).

TLDR:  Took a loss on initial position. It's tanked, but I believe in the company. Do I sell my tanked position and buy in at the new low position or hold my old position while buying in more?

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your chart is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to 10 billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

thanks for the advice, sorry for the newbieness._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let's talk about video games Hi all, 

I'm new to investing and I've been trying to do my research. I am not very good at DD (a lot of the financial data goes over my head) but I'm trying to look at it from a logical point of view. A good tip for investing is to invest in an industry you know. I work in electric vehicles and plan to invest heavily there, but probably the next industry I am most knowledgeable about is video games.... Anyways, here's my opinion, any feedback would be much appreciated. 

&#x200B;

**Prospect for Growth**

First off I think that video games as an industry has a very bright future. Video games are the [most profitable form of entertainment](https://gamecrate.com/statistically-video-games-are-now-most-popular-and-profitable-form-entertainment/20087) right now and can only grow in the future. In the last two decades game studios managed to shift the target demographic from kids to adults, with males age [18-34 playing the most games.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/) Video games aren't for kids anymore and the target demographic is expected to age further meaning that gamers have good access to disposable income. 

Video games are becoming more mainstream and also have technology on their side and become bigger and better year after year. It's impossible to say where the medium will be in 20 years, but considering the difference in the industry between now and the year 2000 then the sky is the limit. 

Overall if you want to diversify and invest in some form of entertainment then video games is the way to go. 

&#x200B;

**Consoles**

I believe that Sony will dominate the next generation of consoles simply because of their exclusive games on offer.  They have had good growth in the last 5 years and I believe this will continue in the next 10 years. They currently cannot keep up with demand for their latest console [but once production ramps up I think they will make significant gains.](https://www.techspot.com/news/88121-insiders-claim-sony-accelerate-ps5-production-2021-meet.html) 

I also see Nintendo doing well. They are carving a good niche in the handheld market and have no real competitors. They also tend to target a younger demographic so don't compete so much with Sony or Microsoft for the adult market. [They are planning to start selling a more powerful verison of their switch console soon.](https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/nintendo-switch-pro-release-date-specs-leaks-and-more)

I expect Microsoft to underperform in the next generation, though I would consider them to be a safe bet overall because of their other business. They may also do very well from their [acquisition of Zenimax (which owns Bethesda)](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-to-acquire-zenimax-media-and-its-game-publisher-bethesda-softworks/) and may see significant gains once their plans to use that are revealed. 

&#x200B;

**Game Studios**

There are a number of game studios worth considering such as Activision, Ubiosoft, Electronic Arts, etc.

However, I would be hesitant to invest in these as I consider game studios to be VERY high profile. I don't think any other industry has as much scrutiny from its customer base. No one knows when one will engulfed in a controversy and have it's stock price suffer. 

But I think I will invest in Take Two interactive, which owns the huge developer Rockstar.  A Red Dead Redemption 3 or Grand Theft Auto 6 would likely be game of the generation and their [online business model make an obscene amount of money](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/69666/gta-made-half-billion-dollars-2019-3-best-earning-game/index.html#:~:text=GTA%20Online%20managed%20to%20make,Year%20in%20Review%20sales%20brief).

&#x200B;

**Hardware**

Of course there is also PC gaming to consider. No console to invest in here but Nvidia and AMD are solid stocks.

&#x200B;

**FINAL VERDICT:**

Overall I think my investment in gaming will look like this, with the intention of holding for the next 10 years. 

Sony +++

Nintendo ++

Take Two ++

Microsoft + 

Nvidia +

So, what does anyone think? I am not good at the financial side of DD so I would be interested in hearing your opinion from that end_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GLNG is looking like a good investment This is not financial advise.

So I was looking at some energy stocks and this one looks like it has good growth potential at a low risk level.

I know it ships natural gas and that's a huge portion of the energy market.

It is currently around 11$ but its book value is 17-20$. Most websites have this in the buy category. 

It is not being shorted heavily either that I can see. If anyone else can confirm this because my smooth brain does not know any better than what I can find on the internet. 

Short Percent of Float:8.79%

Companies that have a short interest as a percentage of float below 10% indicates positive investor sentiment and few short sellers. 
8.79% of Golar LNG's floating shares are currently sold short.

A short interest ratio of 10 or greater indicates strong pessimism about a stock. 
Golar LNG currently has a short interest ratio of 4.0.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Telos Corporation ($TLS) This is my first time posting DD on any security. Probably won't be any good, so I'd love your feedback. 

I'd like to talk about the Telos Corporation, ticker TLS. It IPO'd back in November and I'm curious about what others think of it as a long term play.

# Basics:

Telos is a cybersecurity company focused almost entirely in the government technology sector. They've been around for decades, but only just went public in the last year. At the time of this writing, they are trading at a P/E of 148.48 and EPS of -$0.1229. They currently hover around a $2B market cap.

Some of their clients include the FBI, State Department, FedEx, Raytheon, Verizon, and Citi.

Some of their partners include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Palo Alto networks.

&#x200B;

# Products/Services:

Like I said earlier, Telos operates in the cybersecurity space. Their largest/most popular product seems to be their "Xacta" platform, which is an automated tool to check an organization's compliance to national cybersecurity standards. Additionally, Xacta works as a continuous risk assessment suite that can detect and remediate gaps within an organization's security infrastructure.

In additon to Xacta, they offer Telos Ghost. According to their website, Ghost is

> a robust, scalable, secure communications network-as-a-service that privatizes the public internet to hide network resources and masks the identity  and location of personnel to ensure total protection as they conduct their operations. These same capabilities can also hide servers, applications, and  unified mobile communications to ensure completely private voice, text,  video, and chat over any device.

Telos also offers myriad services from consulting to pen testing.

&#x200B;

# Financials:

I'll be up front, I am horrible with understanding financials of a company. I'll just report here what I see on the Schwab research page for TLS.

For the fourth quarter 2020, analysts estimate TLS will generate revenues of $44.5M, a decrease of 4.31% over the prior year fourth quarter results. Their annualized growth rate over the last four years is 4.5%. In terms of debt, it looks like they are solidly in the red and have been for some time with total equity decreasing from -$125M in 2015 to -$141M in 2019.

 93.7% of last year’s sales came from U.S. federal government contracts.

&#x200B;

# Leadership

Telos is lead by CEO and Board Chairman John Wood. It looks like he's been with the company for almost 30 years, and been CEO since 1994. It seems that much of the management for Telos has been with the company for quite some time.

Interestingly, Keith Alexander (former 4-star general and director of the NSA) was added to the advisory board last May.

&#x200B;

# Personal Opinion

I was lucky enough to get in on Telos at below $20 and have enjoyed the massive runup in the last couple of months. I'm not sure how much steam it has left in it, but I do consider it to have some growth left. After the SolarWinds disaster, the government will likely increase its posture in terms of cybersecurity and Telos seems poised to answer the call. Additionally, with former government officials advising the board, it seems likely that connections exist to get Telos into the hands of the government organizations that need it most. The biggest turn offs for me are its large debt and the fact that the company has been around forever and only recently went public. This was probably just a means to raise funds. I might take profits soon and let the rest ride.

POSITIONS: 50 shares @ \~$20/share._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What can I do to diversify my portfolio? Which level of research would be best? Hello, guys! I am new to the world of stocks and investing, I've been doing a lot of research on it and have come to a conclusion on the best split between my long-term investing and short term investing/trading. I don't have a lot of money per paycheck to spare, so I'm going to put $200 in my account every month and put $150 in the zero-cost Fidelity index fund that mirrors the S&P 500 and I'm going to put the last $50 in either a few stocks in $10-25 increments or all $50 in one stock.

I also saw a post on I believe the day-trading subreddit where one trader said that he makes a solid consistent short-term profit just looking at the volume profile and RSI, buying the stocks just before they hit their ATH. The theory behind it is that once the stock breaks the ATH, calls that have their strike price set at the ATH start buying 'en masse' to cover their calls, which creates buying pressure and shoots the price up. You then hedge your gains and losses with buy and sell stop orders. It seems like a good strategy template for me to try and make it my own. I also added some other factors to look into such as the market cap (as I don't want to risk my money on a company with not much funds/support) and the P/E (to see how over- or under-priced the stock currently is, although I'm finding not every stock has this value available).  What other values or DD factors would you look into to determine the best stocks to try this with? Would you switch out the ones I'm currently looking at, or just add to them?

Thanks for any thoughts!

There is conflicting information on their website, as one commenter pointed out, it says a range between 3-3.5%. 

&#x200B;

It's actually only the spread on foreign currency, which changes every day and it depends on how much you're converting. For example, its about 1% for $30,000-44,000. On top of this, the $9.99 commission is charged in the currency of the equity you are purchasing (e.g. $10 USD for buying a US security).

Solution:

This part is based on TD Web Broker, but should work for other banks. Good new is, you can get around this by transferring you funds to a US RSP or TFSA account, which won't trigger penalties, as they are more or less than same account, only separated in your brokerage web page for visual clarity. You have two options for transfer: either go to Accounts and select 'Cash Transfers and Foreign Exchange' if its sitting in cash or 'Securities Transfer' if you have it tied up in US stocks. You can also call their Web Broker line, like I did, if the button isn't working. TD said it would take one business day for RSP and two days for TFSA to transfer. If you call and have them do it 'back of house, (e.g. calling) you need to remove any pending orders, possibly also stop losses, or they may not start the transfer, as they will wait until orders are settled. In which case, it may be safer just to sell and transfer when you have the cash.

&#x200B;

Once it's in the proper account (US TFSA) you will no longer be penalized for currency conversion, until you take the money out in CAD or purchase CAD stocks (or any non-USD listed security). Only cost should be the $9.99 US commission on each trade, which is lowered after you hit a higher threshold of trades, per quarter.

&#x200B;

Hope that helps.

Need some help with fidelity. Been wanting to create an account for years, like others gme finally motivated me.

Ive learned a lot which is great. Only thing confusing me is why im unable to sell some shares of gme.

So for history i paid 500$ via EFT to my account. I then waited a few days for it to settle.

So then i bought 3 shares gme, and some shares of amc at the same time. All paid with settled account cash.

I then sold my amc shares a few days later (yesterday) and attempted to do the same with gme and it popped up a notification saying id get a good faith violation if i sold

Im pretty confused

My questions:

-	why has my gme stocks not settled despite it being more than 2 days? How much longer do i need to wait?
-	why did my amc shares i bought at the same time not pop up a warning for a GFV but my gme stocks did?


I really cant find much more information except articles saying stocks should settle in 2 days. Its been longer so im just confused. Want to sell while i can but dont want a gfv

I am a brand new investor, one of the many who opened a brokerage account to buy one share of GME (to ride the meme train), and is now looking to start doing more sensible long term investments.

One of the companies I was interested in is Kia because I’ve been a Kia owner for a while am
pleased with the product and have been paying h attention to their growing positive reputation and just heard the news about Apple and Kia sealing a big deal. 

However for the life of me I don’t know what to actually buy? I can go on E*TRADE and search for Kia and get the KIMTF stocks for $30.30 but this is a fixed price there is no history or data on the stock value. If I go to my iPhones stock ticker app I don’t find Kia as KIMTF I find it as 00027.KS and it has the full history of the stock but in (what I gather is) Korean won, not USD. This does not come up on ETRADE.

Could someone explain the difference and what I actually need to buy to get stock in Kia?

Today it had a decent correction due to slowed forecasted revenue growth, I've used their engine to play around with game development and it's insanely good and easy to use plus it has the asset store which makes it easier for small teams and individual devs to make development faster.

The biggest rivals are Godot and Unreal Engine (Epic), now Epic is a different beast, they have their games and store and Godot which imho is the biggest threat, it's getting more and more popular and they have their asset store although I think Unity still has the edge on it.

I still think it's overpriced even after the correction but it's getting interesting I think.

Recently the Company reported that it has completed its multi-phase process to regain its Nasdaq listing and to restructure its balance sheet. This past week,

 “(FDA) has completed its review of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for KP879 (KP879 IND), concluding that the Company may proceed with its planned clinical investigation of the product candidate.”

Now you’re asking why this matters?

“KP879 is being developed as an extended-duration, agonist replacement therapy for the treatment of Stimulant Use Disorder (SUD), a condition for which there are no FDA-approved medications.”

Okay so obviously this is going to take some time and like many of you, I had never heard of this Disorder until I read the article. That being said, there’s more.

“KP879 utilizes serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), KemPharm’s prodrug of d-methylphenidate. SDX is also the primary active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of KP415 and KP484, the Company’s product candidates which are intended for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is anticipated that certain data from previously completed research may be leveraged for KP879, which KemPharm believes could potentially streamline the development timeline of KP879.”

Okay so you’ve heard of ADHD but wtf does any of this mean? 

“2021-03-02 In addition, we recently received Day-74 Letter from the FDA which set the action date ( PDUFA ) for KP415 as March 2, 2021. Under the KP415/KP484 License Agreement, our next milestone payment will be earned if the KP415 is approved on its PDUFA date of March 2, 2021.”   

🚨 March 2nd PDUFA date 🚨

Possible FDA approval should increase the stock price pretty steadily through February leading up to that date.

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [Alphabet](https://ibb.co/NC5sqGv), they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search & YT while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.

The company was founded during the dot com bubble in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://ibb.co/S6x0XHc) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://ibb.co/4jSwJVr) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/T24JLqY) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.

The [company](https://ibb.co/Cmpx7vs) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YT Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://ibb.co/r4p6F1Z), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on R&D in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the DCF it’s important to [NOTE](https://ibb.co/vxtbZcZ) that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the DCF to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://ibb.co/7GQTZS6) also managed to increase their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://ibb.co/c8LKM1g) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more.

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://ibb.co/7vGjYwW) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YT will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of Cohorts.

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world.

But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://ibb.co/NKwgyH2) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://ibb.co/Ks6TNWq) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/fpRmHnk) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price.

Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/W0Lp2W8) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate.

For the Google Services (which include Search, YT & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YT keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year.

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://ibb.co/kJxShSy) the same capex as in the DCF while for the interest income & other incomes which stood at almost $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://ibb.co/rHNCn0d) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/1vws94Z) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810.

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://ibb.co/JthYJF1) are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price. 

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. 

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://ibb.co/GFPxV3K) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YT platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/vL0VccC), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities.

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://ibb.co/NYdX76f) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://ibb.co/m0sMt0t) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let’s start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/RcJL7DK), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock.

But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://ibb.co/ZLyzp7h). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://ibb.co/cLGT2BX), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://ibb.co/rw4kX8w), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://ibb.co/WGNF2dP) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://ibb.co/zFdsN0s) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://ibb.co/4FDfJZz) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

The distribution follows the sale of its operations in Thailand and Malaysia last year.” Via Financial Times.

Tesco is currently trading @ p244.11 or basically £2.44, therefore the dividend is about a 1/5 of the share price. My point is, this is a really big dividend. 

My question however, is around the share consolidation. My understanding is that for every 19 shares currently available, they will be replaced with 15 new ones. This is essentially a reverse split? (Correct me if i’m wrong). The reason they’re doing this is to retain the share price (prices usually reduce when dividends are paid) 

Essentially, i’m just wondering is it worth buying into Tesco now in time for ex dividend date, and selling afterwards, despite the share consolidation. Because it seems the share consolidation is just covering the expected share price drop once the dividend is paid out.

# Technicalities

BB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.

Why would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.

However some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# Contra BB (QNX):

The following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):

1. Toyota
2. VW
3. Daimler
4. Ford
5. Honda
6. BMW
7. GM

&#x200B;

1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).
2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.
3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.
4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.
5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.
6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.
7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.

I didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)

# Pro BB (QNX):

Developing an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).

# Conclusion

In my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).

Furthermore I just searched through job listings for "QNX" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).

Although Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.

Let me hear your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Received Tender offer from Line Corp to buy my stocks from Z Holdings Corp (YAHOF) So as the title suggests I received a tender offer from Line Corp to buy my stocks for Yahoo Japan. 

And I have several questions regarding this:

The offer is also not really tempting, it’s below the current course price so why would I even do it? I’d be better of just selling.

What does it mean for my stock if Line Corp managed to get the requested amount? I initially thought a merger is a good thing and price goes up but why are they making me such a terrible offer for my stock?

Now, I know I have to manage dividend payers much closer than ETF.   
Yet, I wonde rif the yield, no matter how large, will eventually outpace ETF returns.   


let´s take three REIT I own positions in: AGNC (currently at 8,86%) and AAR (currently 10,45%) and OMF (curently 12,27%)

why would I even bother with dividend stocks, if all I care about is steady, save growth ?

Iron ore currently trades at $155/ton. There is some political risk to be sure, but the project is located far from the war’s frontlines. Execution risk is of course a factor, but management is highly experienced in bringing mines to production and has made significant headway with potential financing sources, having received several expressions of interest from political risk insurers, export credit agencies, European banks for debt financing, and has executed a term sheet for royalty financing and is negotiating off take agreements and equity based construction financing agreements.

I'm pretty new to stock investing and still learning at a high rate. A few days ago somebody here shared some bullish DD for AGTC. I looked into it some and as someone with a biomedical background it definetly got my interest. Financial results don't seem promising at the moment (but investing much) and they will release their results 2/10 but I still put them on my hotlist as most analysts rated the share at $7.5 to up to $35by Roth Capital (right now it's around 5). THis news seemed to start pushing up the share price and yesterday news broke this company got a public choice award from Bioprocess. This made the price spike over 20% after hours, drop again and now back at +12%.   
Suddenly I got cought with FOMO and intend to buy at opening. Volume spiked 10x yesterday and my guess is when it goes up so much after hours it will do so more when market opens? Or does it have more chance to correct itself again?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Any good twitter accounts to follow_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hypothetical scenario with high capital question Hello all, I wanted to ask those more experienced than me about something I've been thinking of the past few days.

Hypothetically speaking, if you had a lot of capital to trade with, let's say 100k, could you not simply do your DD on one of the more "safe" stocks (e.g. Starbucks) and look to make sure (as best you can) it's on an upward trend. Wait for the price to dip a little after market open, then place your money into Starbucks, wait for the price to move 1% in a day or so, and then withdraw the money.

Could you not then just repeat this process, taking a few days to do your DD, and making 2/3k a week? Obviously you wouldn't expect to be correct all the time, but in a stable stock with steady growth you'd be right more often than wrong, right?

I know this is essentially day trading, I was just curious as to people's thoughts on why this would be a safe/risky play and the considerations around it that I may be missing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Burned by Meme Stocks? Here is a book recommendation - Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre This book gets shared on r/Daytrading a lot but I thought with the influx of newcomers I would bring attention to it. It was written in 1923 and is a work of fiction, but it is considered to be an unofficial biography of daytrading pioneer Jesse Livermore. 

It's a classic and really helped me learn the difference between "investing" and "speculating". If you were in on Meme stocks at price levels 5x their previous value then you were speculating. It's a risky but also profitable mindset. There's nothing wrong with speculating, it's just important to understand what you are doing. The protagonist has many moments where he makes a fortune and then takes a large loss on the next play. 

It also really drove home that there isn't much new under the sun. In the latter stages of his career, the protagonist engages in market manipulation and the book covers the various schemes people engage in to drive or suppress the price of stocks. If you think that the Jim Cramer video that was resurfaced recently was damning, wait until you read about pre-SEC tactics that people used in the 20's. 

There are lots of quotes and adages still repeated today, including the famous "*bulls* and *bears* make money; *pigs* get *slaughtered*".

I discovered something about myself and I wanted to share. I just started investing last year and dabbled in this and that. Made couple thousand in NIO and TSLA rise but nothing to write home about.

I went in on GME with my life savings at around $44, and was up about 500k. I fell victim to the moving goalpost and didn't sell. I sold while it was crashing and netted about 90k profits. I have no reason to complain and I learned so many valuable lessons. The nature of man's greed, the importance to locking in profits, not counting chickens before they hatch, etc. I got lost in my vision of what I could do with that money, not when it was at 460 but at 1000 etc.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MWK Mohawk Group DD Mohawk Group is quietly becoming a leading consumer products company that currently sells mostly on the Amazon platform. With 11 brands and over 1000+ product SKU’s, Mohawk is on pace for a record 2021 of projected $370m in annual sales. The company uses data from multiple sources, including Amazon, where most of its sales come from, along with other third party sources. Their strategy is straightforward: find categories where there is no clear leader, improve the product by addressing pain points in negative reviews, and automate marketing and logistics to become the leading seller within the category. The goal is to do this across categories, internationally and even on other marketplace platforms. They are already successful with product lists on Shopify and Walmart, in addition to Amazon.

WHAT THEY WANT TO DO: Mohawk’s goal is to find annuity like categories/products that require limited annual refining. For example, a mini fridge between now and a couple of years from now will likely need minimal version changes.

WHAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO: Mohawk wants to stay clear of short term trending categories or products that expose them to product listing displacement. For example, portable headphones like AirPods change every 6 months. That is not what they want.

SO HOW

The answer is AI Mohawk eCommerce Engine, or "AIMEE". This internal software solution unifies idea generation, inventory, automated marketing, warehousing, and logistics. Most single sellers use single point solutions for all these essential business functions with little interoperability (Jungle Scout or Helium 10). For example, can you successfully automate marketing and pricing if your marketing engine does not know how much inventory is in stock? It seems unmanageable at scale and therefore single point software solutions limit product expansion. This is why API's were prioritized by companies like Salesforce with their acquisition of MuleSoft to aggregate data.

AIMEE is utilized in 3 ways.

First is product discovery and creation. And it works. See it: type "countertop refrigerator" or "dehumidifier" into Amazon, and you can see Mohawk's hOmeLabs brand on the top labeled as "bestseller" with editorial recommendations and thousands of reviews above 4.5 star average. Note - this is digital real estate moat. Each product carries its own moat. Digital version of physical real estate.

They have plans of 8-12 product launches each month. They have targets of $1-1.5m in annual sales for products, with a contribution margin target north of 10-15% now. Approximately 80% of the company’s products became profitable within three months of launch. The company defines such profitability by a positive “contribution margin” which accounts for all variable costs associated with a product, such as manufacturing and marketing but not fixed costs.

The second is automation capabilities, which bring inherent efficiency to the business. MWK has been able to keep its headcount nearly flat while maintaining high revenue growth - as of FY19, they had 144 workers (61 employees and 83 independent contractors). That's $792000 revenue per worker in FY19; and then for FY20, they guide 185 million revenue with only 150 workers (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpR8AGRXIAIRBli?format=jpg&name=medium), which yields $1.23 million per worker!

Third, AIMEE allows Mohawk to discover acquisition targets based on category killers. Management knows they can't compete within all categories, and instead, they can acquire these category leading products at an enterprise accretive 2-4x EBITDA today.

This accretive acquisition success is continually confirmed even as of this week:

>Feb 2, 2021 Alliance Global Partners analyst Brian Kinstlinger raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following the company's acquisition of Healing Solutions. The "solid" acquisition validates Mohawk's strategy, Kinstlinger tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees Mohawk as a "rare business that can buy companies on the cheap and easily integrate, while creating instant shareholder value given its relatively high valuation (like an arbitrage)."

>Other growth potentials: Platform as a Service, or PaaS. Mohawk could provide AIMEE as an end to end software solution for product discovery to support functionality, along with an on ramp to multi party warehousing and logistics. We can think about potential users, and potential revenue per user. Single point solutions like Jungle Scout generate ~$300-400 in average revenue per user, while Amazon’s marketplace supports over 3 million sellers worldwide. This space could resemble what Snowflake and other multi-cloud vendors are doing in cloud, creating a platform on top of platforms. If Mohawk were to enter this in the future, expect the stock to be valued like SaaS and its forward price to sales ratio should explode even higher.

VALUATION

Management guides conservatively and constantly raises outlook, and analysts will be raising price targets continually:

>Feb 2, 2021 For full year 2021, the Company expects net revenue to be in the range of $340M to $370M, up from $290M to $320M, reflecting the addition of the Healing Solutions business. The Company is establishing a net income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in a range of $1M to $5M due primarily to quarterly interest expense, net and stock-based compensation expense. The Company is also establishing an Adjusted EBITDA estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in the range of $28M to $32M.

>Feb 3, 2021 Roth Capital analyst Matt Koranda raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group to $37 from $16 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Mohawk has announced the acquisition of Healing Solutions and increased/introduced 2021 revenue/adjusted EBITDA guidance, which both appear highly conservative.

Current Mohawk market cap as of writing: $831 million at $31.8 per share

Revenue growth rate: expected to be >50% (FY20 guided to 185M, FY21 current guidance at 370M). They have a revenue CAGR of 79% since 2016 (Mohawk reported revenues of $73.3 million in 2018, up 101% from 2017, with the top-line doubling each year since 2015)

3Q 2020 results showed operating income increased to $0.1 million compared to an operating loss of $(14.1) million in the third quarter of 2019.

Contribution margin improved to 19.1% from 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019.

Current NTM EV/Sales: 1.8x

I firmly believe the stock should be valued at least 5x NTM EV/Sales by the end of 2021, if they continue to execute. This is based on management's conservative guidance, continued insane growth rate, increasing margins, massive TAM, future international growth potential, future potential SaaS opportunities. MWK can be viewed as blend of CPG and a software/machine learning company where comps for latter trade at even higher multiples.

I would therefore not be surprised if share prices hit $120 at the end of this year ($3 billion market cap valuation)

OTHER POSITIVES:

Strong company culture. Cofounder Yaniv Sarig. Strong visionary. 

Glassdoor reviews are positive and average 4 stars.

Lots of insider buying on the open market when it dipped hard in the summer 2020 and the stock is heavily insider owned.

More institutions buying in: https://fintel.io/so/us/mwk

RISKS:

-Some consider Amazon Basics as a competing risk, but I wouldn't think so. $295 billion of products were sold on Amazon in 2020. That's expected to grow to $500 billion in the next five years. Amazon cannot be the best in every subcategory on its massive marketplace, and Amazon would prefer sellers put their own capital at risk. Jeff Bezos knows this (see link below), and himself said he wants third party sellers to succeed. He wants the marketplace to grow which in the long run makes Amazon more money over customer's spending lifetime, than trying to take short term gain by elbowing sellers off the marketplace platform. He knows he can't win every category. As of December 2020, the amount of Amazon Basics products in the top 10 of their categories fell to near February 2018 levels. This figure peaked to nearly 500 in July of 2019 and has trended lower ever since to 346 products.

-Small cap, which means volatility. Volume is still low, only ~1.3 million shares get traded even on big news days. This means if you are a very emotional investor, you might panic sell - I would expect frequent dips to occur that are unrelated to the fundamentals of the company.

-Geopolitical risks: any major escalation in a china trade war or black swan event (another pandemic or such) that disrupts supply chains would be a huge negative.

-To fund more acquisitions they need to raise more capital. I expect share dilution to occur later this year with secondary offerings.

My dad retired a few years ago and he has always been wary of banks, credit cards, or anything other than cash. Growing up he always paid using cash and never kept any kind of checking account. 

He mentioned he has a checking account now and about 40k sitting in checking. I'm in Canada and mentioned I've been investing in an ETF index fund and have managed to get a decent return the last couple of years. He seemed interested and open to doing something similar.

I don't know the US ETF or index options that would be best. I think he would prefer something that's relatively low risk, but might be open to a little more risk if he gives it a go for a bit.

Skipped TSLA for obvious reasons

**CATL,** the world’s biggest maker of EV batteries, supplies car manufacturers including Tesla, Toyota, BMW, and Volvo. Its lithium-ion phosphate batteries were cheap enough to let Tesla trim the price of its Model 3 by almost 10% last year. The company has developed a power pack that can sustain an electric car for more than 1 million miles.

**Longi** is the world’s largest manufacturer of solar wafers, the building blocks of solar panels. Established in 2000, the company supplies about a quarter of the world’s solar wafers and modules.

Wang Chuanfu set up **BYD** in 1995, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has owned a stake in the carmaker since 2008. It’s converting Shenzhen’s entire fleet of buses, taxis, and trucks into plug-in electric vehicles. BYD is partnering with Didi Chuxing, the world’s largest ride-hailing network, to develop customized 

**Eve Energy** is the fifth-largest supplier to China’s EV sector with 5% market share and counts Daimler, BMW, and Xpeng among its customers. It recently produced lithium-ion samples for an EV battery that can be charged in just five minutes. Liu was a torchbearer for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

Founded by ex-Alibaba executive He Xiaopeng in 2014, **Xpeng** makes an EV sedan and SUV. A third model, an all-electric sedan, will be introduced later this year. The automaker provides free charging services at 670 stations across 100 Chinese cities. The company’s latest P7 sedan model will come with features that enable autonomous driving on highways.

Pratt owns Georgia-based **Pratt Industries**, the world’s largest privately held producer of 100% recycled paper and packaging. The company also runs clean energy plants to help power its mills. Pratt Industries says its operations save 85,000 trees, 35 million gallons of water and more than 5,000 tons of greenhouse-gas emissions every day.

Backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent, **Nio** has surged eightfold in value since its initial public offering in September 2018. The EV maker plans to build a network of 500 power-swap stations—where people can change their car’s battery rather than recharge it—by the end of 2021. Nio’s latest all-electric sedan, the ET7, will start at about $69,000 before government subsidies. It’s almost 70% more expensive than an entry-level Tesla Model 3 built in China.

Wobben developed his first wind turbine in the 1970s and started **Enercon** in 1984. The German company, now one of the world’s largest in the sector, has faced challenges in its home country, where delayed approvals for new wind farms damped sales. It appointed a new CEO in November to engineer a turnaround. Enercon’s E-126 turbine has a rotor diameter of 127 meters (417 feet), longer than a football field.

Established in 2003, **First Applied Material** mainly produces films for solar panels. It makes more than half the world’s ethylene vinyl acetate films, an essential component of solar panels that helps protect them from harsh weather. The company’s shares more than doubled last year.

The company delivered more than 32,000 electric vehicles last year, and its market value has almost tripled since its July 2020 listing. Li Auto recalled 10,469 electric vehicles produced from November 2019 to June 2020 because of a front-suspension issue.

Cao Renxian quit his teaching job and founded **Sungrow Power Supply** in 1997. The company controls about 15% of the global market for solar inverters, which convert the output of a solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current. China added 48 gigawatts of solar capacity last year, equivalent in power to 5.28 billion LED lightbulbs.

Husband-and-wife team founded **Yadea** Chinese maker of internet-connected electric scooters in 2001. Its shares jumped more than 680% last year as people sought more socially distanced and environmentally friendly ways to commute during the pandemic.

**Wuxi Lead** is China’s biggest publicly traded manufacturer of lithium-battery equipment. Its clients include Panasonic, Sony, Samsung SDI, LG Chem, CATL, and BYD. It’s the biggest supplier to CATL, which announced plans to invest $388.9 million in the battery-equipment maker in September.

Founded in 2005, **JA Solar** is one of China’s largest manufacturers of silicon wafers, cells, and modules for solar panels. The company sells its products to more than 135 countries and regions, and 72% of its revenue in 2019 came from outside of China. The company is investing $1.6 billion to ramp up its photovoltaic production capacity, including building solar cell and panel factories in Vietnam._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Screening for stocks and how can I make it less of a hassle? Hello, a bit longer of a post than I intended but I hope I can get some great answers!

I've been trading for the last couple years and been a lurker here for a while. I've recently fallen into a bit of a slump when it comes to investing, mostly because doing my own DD is incredibly time consuming and hasn't been fruitful lately. The main issue I've had is that there are *thousands* of stocks out there, and weaning them down to the ones that are worth doing some digging into is nigh impossible for someone who is a novice. I can get maybe one or two stocks adequately researched in a day, but when all you're digging up is junk it feels like a waste! So I started to skip over screening and just kept an ear to the ground here and elsewhere for tickers and use those as a jumping off point for research. That's treated me well but I feel like never learning a core fundamental leads me to have a shakey foundation. Not to mention I just feel like a follower rather than an investor when I do that exclusively. 

I want to get better at screening for stocks, and research in general. It's the basis of trading and I feel like I should've mastered this first and foremost. There's tons of information out there about TA but not a lot when it comes to just general screening. I'm sure it's out there but again its like separating the wheat from the chaff trying to find something out there that's both useful and that isn't being sold to you. 

I'm not really sure what kind of trader I am yet in this stage as most of my learning came during the financial crisis. I learned a lot, but I learned it from a very unique year. 

This is how I usually proceed: 

* I generally use Finviz's screener to look through group performance to see which sectors are doing well and not so well. I've tried some other tools but I always end up coming back to Finviz despite the ads. 
* From that I filter through a particular sector that I'm interested in. I filter anything larger than small cap, and anything higher that $10 which tends to cut out a large chunk. I like to see volume, so I set that at around 500K to 1M depending on the sector. I used to use Performance but after COVID and the market tanking I feel that it's skewed. This still leaves me with a lot and cuts out a lot of plays I could have taken.
* If I'm looking for undervalued stocks that I want to hold for some time I focus on P/E and Performance for Quarter to look for ones that have had a rough time recently. From there I dig into individual companies, which usually ends up being several pages of stocks. 
* then I switch over to Webull. I start digging into the financials tab, news, earning report history, analyst ratings (with a grain of salt), and EPS over the last 4 quarters. The lot of the other financial indicators I'll glance at but honestly I don't know what half of them really mean other than their definition if that.

What are your tips for weaning down the numbers to manageable levels without cutting out potentially good plays? What "tell-tale" financial information do you use to decide if a stock is worth looking into further? What tools do you use?  When you research a stock what are you looking for? 

Any recommendations to changes to my method are more than welcome. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How many shares of a stock do you normally buy? Basically I just started doing stocks last month.

Say I were to pull it all out, add another 20k and invest it in a stock (or a number of stocks) that pay dividends. I’ll use IVR as an example. It’s currently paying 32 cents annually per share. This is divided into quarters. The stock is trading today for $3.80.

Hoping someone with more knowledge of the US DTC can educate me on the matter.

As I understand it, RH and other brokers were not able to meet capital collateral requirements last week and were effectively forced to halt purchases on the meme stocks such as GME due to insane buy order volumes increase the need for collateral they didn't have. I already understand the process of the collateral and settlement but I feel like there is something I'm missing  from the whole thing.

1. Collateral required can be a function of many factors, for the purpose of the discussion and as it relates to GME, the most inpactful factor is probably volatility.

2. Collateral is always a %  of the total purchase volume x transaction price. Offset by sales from the broker. 

My question is, if a stock like GME triggered a capital requirement large enough to halt purchases, how is it possible this doesn't happen to other stocks?

I know some obvious answers are, well clearly not all stocks swing like GME. Sure but lets take TSLA for an example. 

TSLA swinged from 400 to 800 in albeit a longer period of time (say 3 weeks, not sure if that's accurate) but the  absolute value of the share was significantly higher than GME, BB AMC and the such. I also doubt that during that TSLA rally that there were many sellers or at least from an order perspective not many were selling. So similar to the meme stocks and their demand before they were halted.

Then, even with less volatility providing a smaller collateral %, the value of the stock would have made up for the difference between TSLA collateral requirments and the meme stocks. (This is just speculation / an example didn't crunch any numbers here but I feel like it's a fair assumption when the price is literally starting at x10)

My question is, 
1. Is my understanding and description of the situation correct or am I misinformed?
2. If I'm not entirely misinformed, how reasonable then is the assertion by the brokers that purchases were halted due to a lack of capital?

With everyone so focused on meme stocks and tech companies, the energy sector has really taken a beating is has yet to recover. With the increase in travel and decrease in lock-downs, oil demand is rising. With Biden in office, I think a lot of people are bearish on oil because he is really pushing for clean energy, but the infrastructure for green energy is not close to ready for handling the world's energy demand. 

It is only a matter of time before oil companies are making a profit again. And with the demand going up and supply decreasing this is causing a fast rise in oil prices. Higher prices means more revenue per barrel. 

Here are my picks

British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobile

All have consistently made profits Pre-Covid, all give dividends, all down majorly from their lows, and All investing Heavily into green energy (which should keep Biden off their back and allow for a smooth transition into the green energy market).

Even though these companies all loss money in 2020, the event that happened in 2020 was abnormal and will most likely not happen again in 2021. Chances are these companies will make a profit in 2021 and definitely make a profit in 2022.

I’m starting a 4-year graduate program this coming Fall, and the plan all along was to pay for this pretty much solely using student loans. Blah blah my career choice will hopefully pay off in the end, but obviously during my graduate years I’m looking at being pretty broke and in some heavy debt the next few years. Luckily, I’ve had some success in the market during my gap year and have able to save up around ~30k in various investments. My question is: should I keep this money invested during my graduate years and rely solely on borrowed money to survive? Or should I take this money out of the market and watch it slowly dwindle away while I spend it on rent and food? This probably won’t even last me the full 4 years, and at the end sure I’ll have 30k less in debt but also 0 savings or assets.

Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in Washington also played a critical role in the market’s resilience, which will drive stocks higher in the long run, the bank said.

“We believe that we are still in the early stages of a new bull market, transitioning from the ‘Hope’ phase to a longer ‘Growth’ phase as strong profit growth emerges,” said chief global equity strategist  Peter Oppenheimer said in a note.

“The changing mix of policy support in this cycle also suggests a possible inflection point towards a more reflationary environment than we have seen since the financial crisis,” Oppenheimer added. “This regime shift is likely to drive the bull market higher over coming months and also have important implications for market leadership.”

New drilling and completion activity in the US really comes to life when oil is above $50/bbl, and E&P’s have found sand is one of the most effective ways to improve oil well production. Why? Sand keeps cracks in oil and gas producing rock open longer and helps flow of oil. The USA is a “swing” producer in the global oil industry. When oil is below $40, the industry retreats hard but above $50 and it ramps up quickly.

If you read all of the E&P’s capex budgets for 2021, they all want “short cycle”, quick payback investments which is the wells US Silica serves. Deepwater is expensive and takes years to produce the first barrel, whereas US onshore payback is VERY fast. This helps cash flows of oil companies meaningfully.

Look at SLCA’s stock price in 2016-2017, when they were crushed by low oil prices in 1Q 2016, but their stock rallied exceptionally well (probably moved too fast) when demand came back.

Delivering sand to drill sites is very challenging, but US Silica is a logistical leader and a preferred supplier. They have always known sand is purely a commodity and that their customers want logistics and quick delivery, which is a key focus of their business. The are a tier 1 logistics company and was a first mover in the industry. Demand for sand is coming back to life fast and US Silica’s management team is best in the industry.

SLCA also has a large industrial sand business which has helped them survive downturns in oil. They made an acquisition (EP Minerals) to grow this industrial business a couple years ago and it’s going well so far.

This is probably not a stock you want to get married to because oil and gas in the USA is super volatile and it’s an out of favor industry. However, this industry was on its knees 9 months ago but is undeniably in recovery mode right now. Their industrial sand business is actually pretty good and management seems to want to grow it due to it being a higher multiple, more steady earnings stream but oil and gas has a lot of upside.

Sand is one of the most important parts of producing oil in the USA and SLCA is at the center of it with a capital light business model that is far preferable to the E&P companies’.

So..I'm not asking how to do research in general, I'm asking how YOU personally do it. Not research the financials of a company but more like the intangible "industry-ness".

Can potentially make so much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividend investing: Personal Lessons and Prospects It’s been a while since I compose any long post on Reddit and wow I can’t remember how many dramatic events have occurred. As a dividend investor I have learned a lot of lessons in the past few months, some with benefits, others costing me money. Just want to share some personal thoughts on dividend equities and things I’ve done to prepare for 2021.

I consider myself a dividend investor and in the past few years I was doing alright. My equities portfolio primarily consists of more established industries with a consistent record of dividend payment, such as manufacturing (especially consumer products and machinery), energy, airliners, hospitality, REITs, retail, military industries, telecommunications, and media. I did buy index ETFs but not a lot. For the sake of safety, my bonds portfolio was mostly US treasuries ETFs with different maturity dates and only a small portion of investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds was included. I also invested heavily in gold ETFs. For the past few years, I reaped a steady 3%-5% dividend each year. I rarely trade my portfolio but whatever I have sold generally also brought realized gains. As of early March 2020, my entire portfolio still had a roughly 25% upside. I can’t say I was doing marvelously in investing, but at least I was happy with the situation. 

I don’t need to mention how the COVID pandemic changed the entire economic and investment landscape. All I need to say was that sometime in March 2020 I witnessed my portfolio turning from 25% up to 10% down in the matter of days. I was not accustomed to frequent trading, so I was shocked and didn’t know what to do. Most established and cyclical industries took a heavy beating, so not only did stock prices plummeted, but dividends were also generously SLASHED. On the other hand, all these up-and-coming-pandemic-benefiting-concept stocks that I totally did NOT understand were soaring through the sky. By the time I came to my senses and figured out what I should do, I was in a situation where my portfolio loss almost equaled all the dividends I’ve earned in the past few years and then some. I was forced to adjust my strategy. I sold stocks that either would not recover very soon or still showing gains to cover the losses, and bought in stocks, ETFs and bonds that were doing alright while still generating good dividend. I did more trading in 2021 than in the past 4-5 years combined. In the end, I still ended up earning some money for the entire 2020, but the majority I have owned was eaten up by my initial losses.

In light of the past and looking forward to 2021, My personal thoughts are as follow.

\-Dividend investing is NOT like high-yield savings account or CDs. You can’t just put money in the portfolio as if you were depositing it into a bank account, then sit back, relax and enjoy the interests. Dividend equities are still equities and hence they are subjected to market fluctuations. Portfolios need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted. I plan to review my portfolios every month in 2021 and seek to sell equities that show signs of fatigue or weakness. I shall also adjust more quickly to sudden market shifts and/or “black swan” events. 

\-Don’t just focus on dividend yield. Yield percentage could be deceiving as declining stock price could produce a higher dividend yield in a short period of time. Instead of “looking for high-yield equities that have good fundamentals and prospects” I switch to “looking for equities that have good fundamentals and prospects that also generate decent dividend yield”. Six sectors in US equities that have rescued my portfolio performance in 2020 were IT techs/cloud services, 5G techs, online shopping, renewable energy, healthcare, and semiconductor/chip production. I am continually investing in these four sectors and picking out good dividend stocks and ETFs. Choices include: NXTG (ETF), IBUY (ETF), IXJ (ETF), ICLN (ETF), TSM (stock), MSFT (stock), CCI (stock/REITs), AMT (stock/REITs).  

\-Sometimes, basic instincts could help a lot. In summer months of 2020, amid the darkest months of pandemic lockdown, I scratched my head and pulled my hair over what sectors I should invest in. Then out of fatigue and laziness I just returned to the basics: What do people need when they are at home? OK, they still need to through trash away, use tap water, and get stuff delivered to their homes. Hence I bought WM (waste management), AMT (water infrastructure), UPS (for delivery) and PAG (transportation). I also had the strange gut feeling that given the drinking culture in this country people would drink more alcohol. So, I bought DEO (Diageo). All five did well in both stock prices and dividends. Of course, the recovery is looming large now and things might change again. However, capturing the trend may not be as complex as those investment talking heads on the media suggest. 

\-Diversification around the globe matters. With the US and Western Europe still deeply mired in the pandemic, some other regions have showed signs of early recovery. Also, with gaps of interest rate exhibiting, some government bonds are more equal than the others. BWX (international treasuries) and DVYA (Asia Pacific high dividend) were two ETFs I used to diversify my portfolio internationally in bonds and equities. They have done well in 2020 and I plan to hold on to them. I am also eyeing ETFs of individual countries such as South Korea, Japan and China. 

\-Finally, I have learned to comfortably admit that I am just not particularly good at investing. I don’t have the skills, heart and time required to be a day trader and I can’t handle more complex products such as options. In fact, had I just sold my entire portfolio in 2020 and invest whatever that is left into either one index ETF of any of the 3 major indexes (SPY, QQQ, VOO…you name it) or my best-performing active management mutual funds (BCAPX), I could have done a lot better. Therefore, I happily yield some of my money to those suckers at Wall Street and let them do the headache for me. I have assigned around 40% of my portfolio to index ETFs and mutual funds and I do not plan to sell any of those in 2021.

Trying to decide if I should hold on and add to my position or if it’s a good time to sell soon_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Livent (LTHM) is a Great Play on EV  Here's my take on Livent, which is due to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility. 

**Key Catalysts:** 

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.   

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe. 

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens. 

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America. 

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

&#x200B;

**Financials and Valuation** 

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve. 

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

*Data from Yahoo Finance, February 3, 2021_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RYCEY: Long term value play   

RYCEY 100 shares at 1.37...not advice not an advisor

New to investing and welcome critique

**Background**

RYCEY (Rolls-Royce Holdings) is involved in aerospace and defense based out of Britain. RR currently is the second largest producer of aircraft engines (2nd to GE) and also has a role in marine and energy applications. RYCEY owns Rolls-Royce, the company that made the famed merlin engine that helped the Brits fight off the Nazis in the Battle of Britain powering Spitfire warplanes. It is a symbol of pride for the Brits and Boris Johnson even said “the government would work with Rolls to ensure its long-term future as a great, great British company”.

**Prior to the Pandemic**

Things still weren’t great. RYCEY was struggling to grow a profit. And although revenue was rising steadily from 2013 to 2020 earnings oscillated between the red and green ([https://www.aol.com/news/volatility-101-rolls-royce-holdings-130612055.html](https://www.aol.com/news/volatility-101-rolls-royce-holdings-130612055.html)). January 2020 the stock took a major hit as Boeing 787 were swapped out for fears of major failures. In face a string of engine issues and even some corruption/discrimination allegations have plagued the company in recent years.

**The Bad**

It should be easy to see why the short term picture for RR is not looking good. Performance problems, and reduced travel and thus reduced maintenance, COVID variants threatening effectiveness of vaccines. 

**Why even think about it?**

Rolls Royce will not be allowed to go belly up. Its too well established and too much a part of history for the British Government to let it die out. Other sectors in aviation have seen large gains since the worst of the pandemic, but RYCEY has not. This is likely due to how they get paid for their services. Where GE and many other companies get paid for engines Rolls gets paid for maintenance… This explains somewhat why they have lagged behind recovering from the pandemic. If planes don’t fly they don’t need maintenance… and big planes like the Airbus it powers wont be up for quite awhile. Rolls also stated they are entering the space industry exploring nuclear powered craft for deep space exploration. 

In short RYCEY is a long term 5-10 year play with a lot of upside once the pandemic subsides. Risk I believe will be mitigated by UK bailouts as they serve as a symbol to the Brits and host several defense contracts. Currently at a 52 week low, the upside is enormous_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sabre $SABR is poised for a breakout Sabre is a leading technology solutions provider to the global travel industry. It trades on NASDAQ under the ticker $SABR and currently has a share price of $12.73 with a market cap of $4.04 billion. Sabre holds the number-two share of global distribution system air bookings (38.8% as of the end of 2019 versus 37.1% in 2018). The global distribution system segment represented 73% of total 2019 revenue. The company also has a growing IT solutions division (27% of revenue) that focuses on the airline, hospitality, and travel agent end markets. Transaction fees, which are tied to volume and not price, account for the bulk of revenue and profits. Beyond just being a good short squeeze opportunity, I think this company has potential to be a great long-term hold given its trading at ~45% bellow COVID-19 highs.

Thesis 1) Potential Short Squeeze Opportunity:

Keeping with our current theme, the biggest catalyst Sabre has is the fact that it currently has a 19.45% short interest. It has 274,710,000 shares outstanding with 61,700,000 shares being shorted. Due to its moderate volume, the short interest ratio / days to cover is 7 days making it a prime candidate for a short squeeze. Given some positive catalysts such as their recently announced Google Partnership as well as the fast vaccination rollout in the U.S., I think now is an excellent time to start buying the stock.

Thesis 2) Newly Forged Google Partnership:

On January 21, Google Cloud announced it has joined forces with Sabre Corporation to help digitally transform the traveler’s experience and co-create the future of travel. The 10-year-strategic partnership between Google and Sabre will enable the travel provider to improve operational agility while developing new services and creating a new marketplace for its airline, hospitality and travel agency customers. I think this a great initiative from management and the company, and it will reap the benefits from this partnership.

• Improving Sabre’s technology capability: Sabre will begin the process of migrating its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud’s highly available and secure services. The partnership provides Sabre advanced support and greater flexibility to meet its technology objectives.

• Using Google Cloud tools to enhance and optimize travel: Google Cloud’s data analytics tools will enable Sabre to enhance the capabilities of current and future products. They will provide Sabre with insights to help them improve operational efficiency and create and optimize travel options, improving both loyalty and revenues for its customers.

• Driving a broader innovation framework: The two companies have aligned upon a framework that leverages talent and assets of both companies to imagine, develop and deploy future capabilities that will advance the travel ecosystem, benefiting all market participants.

Thesis 3) Vaccination Roll-Out:

Finally, travel should recover to pre-COVID levels once vaccines are rolled-out. Luckily for America, it has been doing a pretty good job at it. In the U.S., more Americans have now received at least one dose than have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. So far, 35 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally. In the last week, an average of 1.34 million doses per day were administered. In the U.S., the latest vaccination rate is 1,335,310 doses per day, on average. At this rate, it will take 11 months to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose vaccine. All in all, before the year is out we should see a meaningful progress towards achieving full immunity which means we can go back to travelling! This increase in travel will obviously benefit Sabre as well as the broader airline and travel adjacent industries.

In conclusion, I think now is a great opportunity to pick up some Sabre shares which is a fundamentally strong business that is trading at a steep discount (deep value anyone?). It has several favorable catalysts that will help share prices in the short term while also being a great long-term holding due the fundamental strength of the business. I’m long

 Again, since UVXY is a leveraged ETN, it should not be held outright for extended periods. Due to the compounding of daily returns, UVXY’s returns over periods greater than one day would significantly differ from the target return. 

&#x200B;

* These products typically only track the percentage performance of their respective underlying indices for a period of one day. Due to the compounding of daily returns, it doesn’t make sense to buy and hold these ETNs for extended periods of time.
* Volatility ETNs are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities and have a maturity date. Moreover, they are only backed by the credit of the issuer.
* Depending on which product, it could potentially lose a large portion of its value – forcing the issuer to redeem the ETN (causing it to cease trading).

This is very good news for MREIT stocks, especially the more stable ones like NLY/AGNC.

These reit's make their money via the spread on long and short term interest rates. It's possible that they will raise their already fat 10%+ dividends even higher over the next few quarters, which may cause a quick increase in share price. 

Book value may decline, but that was only really a concern early in the year when there were worries about margin calls and liquidity. It's likely that most mreit's even the most troubled ones will see a nice return through 2021. 

IMO it's a nice option for investors looking for a decently reliable 15-20% return on their stock over the next year. 

Main downside - dividends from REIT's count as ordinary income, so putting them in a roth IRA may be a good option. I'd also re-evaluate at the end of the year.

Then of course the Tilray Merger was announced and it was said that APHA shares would be converted to 0.83 Tilray shares in Q2.    


So the question is, at the current price of each stock, owning APHA would present a premium over Tilray if converted.  Is that right?  Or is there going to be some adjustment made to the price of Tilray's share price after the conversion is completed.   For instance lets say I own 1000 shares of APHA (currently priced at 16.60 = $16,600 market value) and after the conversion I would have 830 shares of TLRY (currently priced at 26.78 = $22,228 market value).  That would suggest a 34% increase in market value just on the conversion alone.  My instinct tells me that there will be some sort of price adjustment after the merger to account for this, but then wouldn't that dilute the value of current TLRY share holders stock, i.e. why would you invest in TLRY right now if that's the case?  I can't seem to find any hard info on this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you do when a highly speculative stock spikes on no news? I'll be specific here, but to be clear I'm not recommending this stock to anyone: HGEN. Today it abruptly spiked to a max of around 13%. Like I mentioned, it's very speculative. There's a possibility they have a covid treatment that will be approved for emergency use, which would be huge for them, but no news at all came out today, at least none that I've been able to find. So basically as far as I'm concerned it suddenly spiked for absolutely no reason.

I expect that if the news I was hoping for does manifest, then there will be more of a return than this. But there's a good chance that might never happen and this spike evaporates. So what do you do in cases like this? Take advantage of the unexplained spike and get out, or wait to find out if there's a good reason for the pop?

I work in the engineering department for a city of roughly 120,000 people and like the rest of country, the infrastructure that was constructed 50+ years ago is starting to degrade and need replacing. One of the most important parts of any system is how it can convey water to the outfall during rain events. Back in the day, the pipes used for storm water were made of concrete. Sure, they are very strong, and if constructed right, will last a while. We have a 72” line that was constructed in 1927 and is mainly in good condition. 

Unfortunately, these concrete pipes are falling apart nowadays. So, instead of replacing them with the same material pipe, we were introduced to ADS, a company that specializes in polypropylene pipes. It’s essentially a very durable plastic that can last much longer to concrete when constructed properly. I can go into much more technical details such as the fact that ADS pipes come in 20ft sections instead of 8 ft sections like concrete, reducing the number of joints, which reduces the number of areas that can fail. Or the fact that it takes only 2-4 men to lift an WMS pipe compared to having an excavator lift a concrete pipe. 

There a number of advantages. Over the past year, the price has gone up $61.00. This is just my opinion on the company and would like to hear what you guys have to say._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $VERU Whats it’s potential? What are everyone’s thoughts on $VERU?

#   [https://tos.mx/VPuILrE](https://tos.mx/VPuILrE)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tax preparation companies (INTU and HRB) are going to pop up on earnings this year Alright, I'll start this by saying I bought 120 more shares of GME today, and I am continuing to hold. **That being said** there are other stocks too. And while I continue to buy and hold GME, I have extra money and have spent a bunch of time thinking of my next play. I've actually waited to post this here because I knew it would get downvoted until something besides a meme stock was discussed.

# The play: HRB and/or INTU

What makes a company pop up on earnings? Two things: (1) earnings that surprise Wall Street in a good way, and (2) guidance that the earnings will be sustainable. The best guaranteed play for this in the upcoming year is tax preparation services: H&R Block (HRB) and TurboTax (INTU). HRB is a boomer stock, but cheap. INTU is a growth stock, though calls are more expensive than HRB. HRB has the biggest chance of a massive jump on earnings because its market cap is lower, but INTU has the biggest chance of your option expiring way ITM because Wall Street loves its growth. Both of these tax preparation services offer virtual services, and HRB is strongly focused on promoting their virtual tax prep services this year, which should mitigate pandemic-related declines in revenue.

Wall Street is pricing in earnings from tax season this year for H&R Block and TurboTax to be more or less the same as last year. So why would their earnings surprise Wall Street? A few reasons.

# New investors will have to pay for tax preparation services for the first time this year, and there are a ton of new investors

Tax preparation is free in TurboTax if you file 1040ez or 1040a, which are the forms filed by the majority of people: As long as your income is less than $100,000 or a few other things, you can file a 1040ez or 1040a rather than a 1040. However, there are a couple of things that necessitate filing a 1040 that have increased dramatically over the last year.

One of those things that necessitates filing a 1040 is capital gains or losses, and there are a *ton* of people who have capital gains or losses for the first time--namely, new retail investors. Every quarter in 2020 posted record numbers of new retail investors from brokerages I could find that information from. The overwhelming majority of new retail investors have always been able to file a 1040ez or 1040a, which are free to file using TurboTax. However, if a new retail investor has sold *any* stock for a gain (capital gains), or if a new investor didn't sell a single stock at a profit but still wants to claim a capital loss against taxable income, s/he won’t be able to file a 1040a/ez this year. Every single one of these new investors, which came in record numbers each quarter last year, will have to pay for tax preparation (1040) rather than being able to use TurboTax for free (1040ez). I *guarantee* you that Wall Street is not thinking about this. It’s been so long since they’ve filed a 1040ez or a 1040a that they forgot the conditions that allow you to file a 1040ez/1040a vs. a 1040, and that’s shown in the expected earnings for these companies being the same as last year.

Relatedly, the Google trend for “capital gains taxes” is roughly twice as high right now as it ever has been in the last five years. Additionally, this search term was elevated during the entire year of 2020 relative to the same point in time over the last five years (e.g., Google gives it a 49 for July 12-18 2020 vs. a 15 for July 14-20 2019 or an 18 for July 8-14 2018). Clearly, there are many, many people who will be paying capital gains taxes--and thus paying for tax preparation services--for the first time this year.

Importantly, *all of the extra money from new traders is sustainable*. All of these people filing a standard 1040 for the first time are presumably going to keep investing, so the extra money they pay in tax prep won’t go away. This will result in good guidance and a boost from analysts after earnings.

# Nearly every basic girl will have to pay for tax preparation services this year

Another one of those things mentioned above that necessitates filing a 1040 is self-employment income. Enter Etsy. The string “Etsy taxes” has nearly doubled this year in Google Trends, and the number of active Etsy sellers increased 51% year-over-year from 2019 to 2020--up to \~3.7 million active sellers according to the latest data I could find. Self-employment income only needs to be reported if it’s over $600 per year, but I know my someone made that much money on Etsy and she doesn’t even have a big shop. All of these new sellers that made over $600 in gross revenue (prior to any materials cost deduction) will need to file a 1040 rather than a 1040ez or 1040a, and thus pay for tax preparation services—presumably for the first time—rather than using those services for free. Again, I think that these Etsy shops are here to stay. People like selling stuff they make, and other people like buying handmade stuff.

# Insider activity suggests tax preparation companies are good buys

So there are a few good reasons to think that more people will be filing 1040 this year, but what evidence is there that that will translate to increased earnings for HRB or INTU? Insider activity.

Insiders at H&R Block and Intuit (TurboTax) have been buying up their own stock like crazy. For example, the president and CEO of H&R Block purchased $350,000 of HRB stock with his own money in late December. Over the last six months (i.e., since September), H&R Block employees have increased their holdings by 13.8%, and no insider has sold a single share. Similarly, over the last six months, TurboTax (INTU) insiders increased their holdings by a net 27.2%. Insiders sell for a variety of reasons, but they buy the stock for only one reason: they believe that their stock will go up. Clearly, people in the know with regards to what to expect during earnings believe that these stocks will go up by quite a bit in the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** All of you beautiful kids who are new to investing and have always filed 1040a or 1040ez before will have to pay for TurboTax or H&R Block for the first time ever, which Wall Street for whatever reason isn't pricing in. Same goes for every basic girl and her Etsy shop. Insiders are buying this like crazy because they expect it to go up.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice; don't listen to me. I also have stock and calls in these companies for the reasons I outlined above. Finally, I did this DD around a week ago and waited to post it because of meme stock hype, so some of the numbers might be slightly outdated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which precious metal to invest a couple thousand GBP into? Demise of the fiat currency? 
Hello everyone, I have two things I’d like ask:

I’ve obviously noticed the push surrounding silver as I’m sure you all have as well. I didn’t invest into it because I’m very new to understanding precious metals and I’m wondering if you can give me some insight into which precious metal/s I should expose myself to. 

I’m aware of all precious metal’s position as a hedge for currency and of silver’s growing usage in clean energy/other technologies as well as it’s hedge potentiality. What percentage exposure of my total precious metals portfolio should I have allocated to each metal do you suggest? I will be buying physical metals.

I’m also concerned with the growing global debt, the seemingly inevitable demise of the USD as a fiat currency due to unhinged money printing and loan giving. What are your thoughts on a potentially devastating crash’s impact on other currencies because of it’s position as the world’s reserve currency. 
If you have the time I would also like your insights into the potential of the world resorting back to the gold standard once fiat currencies have been exacerbated, like we had before 1971. In fact, any suggestions of what the world’s money system would change to, not necessarily to the gold standard, in the eventuality that we’d live without a fiat currency would be brilliant.

The stock had already bottomed and started climbing by the time guidance on Q1 was given on the call. 

Is the game really that rigged?

T just grinds along with a great dividend so not counting on a lot of growth there. I'm already into T, roughly $12k. It's pretty boring, but predictable.

KO has a decent dividend and might get a pop in price once things start opening back up hopefully later this year. I do not own any KO.
