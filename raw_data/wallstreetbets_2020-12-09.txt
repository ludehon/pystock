Raven Industries is a small-cap [(but over $1 Billion market capitalization currently)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RAVN/). Their highest market cap range was $1.75B in [September of 2018](https://ycharts.com/companies/RAVN/market_cap), with a huge dip due to the 'rona. So mods, don't think I missed the submission rules.

**What Raven Industries Do**

"Applied Technology" aka fancy tech for farmers. Field computers, guidance/steering, machine control, yada yada. Anything to get Jebediah out of his tractor and behind a tablet.

"Engineered Films" - you need a big blanket to cover up an entire pond, but specifically made to protect the environment from hydrocarbon contaminants? You get Absolute Barrier Y30BAC, and you get a pond sized liner in a week.

"Aerostar" - This is the big one. Raven provides quick deployment balloon systems for everything from surveillance and communication systems to monitoring atmospheric conditions. NASA loves these and so does Alphabet/Google [(check out Project Loon)](https://loon.com/), both current Raven customers. They're pretty much satellites you can deploy from the ground that can smell your last FD's rotting corpse from [19 miles high.](https://ravenaerostar.com/aerospace-and-defense/scientific-research)

**WHY YOU ARE BEING SPOON FED ABOUT THIS STOCK**

Our lord and savior, Cathie Wood and ARKQ has [initiated a position on RAVN.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/12/18582800/raven-industries-small-cap-agriculture-balloon-technology-stock-cathie-wood-likes) Moreover, they have since increased their stake from an initial $5 million to a current stake of around [$12 million in 2 months.](https://cathiesark.com/arkq-holdings-of-ravn) That's what prompted me to take a look at some of Raven's performance.

**PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS**

Pulling data from Fidelity's Key Statistics derived from Raven's latest Edgar filings, Raven has some interesting metrics:

Gross Margin (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 40.27%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 38.06%, putting them in the 75th percentile of Industrials. Solid but not mind blowing.

Return on Equity (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 10.65%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 11.75%, putting them in the 50th percentile of Industrials. Middle of the pack.

Return on Assets (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 8.56%, Avg sector is 3.98%, putting them in the 92nd percentile. Now we're talking.

According to the [Nov 24 earnings report](https://investors.ravenind.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raven-industries-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2021), the applied technology and Aerostar segments saw an increased revenue of 22% and 15% year over year respectively. Tractors go brr, balloons go prrrrt.

Total Debt/Capital (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): 3.03%, avg of sector is 57.13%. It has *extremely* low debt obligations relative to other industrials. Now normally this is where you say that they're idiots because they're not properly leveraging. But to that I say that this company is ran by a bunch of South Dakotans who listen to Dave Ramsey on their truck radios and avoid debt like its a minority they're not familiar with.

I've had a lot of bourbon since I started writing this post, so I'll leave with this. I am bullish with 300 shares and 10 calls at varying strikes for May 2021 (furthest out I could go). The current options sentiment is massively bullish. I'm talking Call/Put ratio of 434:1 for today's volume, open interest C:P is 27:1. For the smoother of brains out here, that means that we can't have a bear hunting season, because thus far we cannot determine whether bears even exist.

Airbnb (ABNB) is going public tomorrow aiming for a valuation of $42B or $60/share. This is cheap. The bankers are pricing it, as if it is another Uber/Lyft. Whereas in reality is multiple times better as it can become a high margin business. **Price target: $150/share**. Let me explain why.

# Unique supply

The long-tail of Airbnb hosts tends to be lazy and only list their properties on Airbnb. Which is great as it makes it a must visit platform for guests. This contrary to Uber/Lyft where all drivers/customers are on both and pricing is all that matters for the consumer.

&#x200B;

# Demand comes for free 

91% of visitors are organic/direct, meaning that they don’t pay for them with marketing. This contrary to platforms like booking.com that are burning most of their margin on Google ads. This is firstly driven by the above mentioned unique content offering. Secondly it is driven by Airbnb’s focus on user experience. Basically making the platform pleasant to use. Which results in an Airbnb you want to use, and a booking.com which you have to use because the algos make you. This brings potential for margin expansion because you don’t have to grow marketing spend in order to grow revenue (decoupling these = extra profit margin!).

# Margin expansion

Even though above characteristics should make it relatively easy to turn a decent profit for Airbnb, they have historically mainly written losses. Currently they blow all the margin on refunds, too many developers, and an expensive office in SF, etc. Yet, if during the next 10 years they focus on the bottom line it could become a great 30-40% margin business. This would bring it in line with marketplaces that enjoy similar 'winner takes most' characteristics such as horizontal classifieds and property platforms. Details below on the potential costs as % of revenue.

|*Component*|*Airbnb 2020*|*Booking 2020*|*Airbnb 2030*|*Logic*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Operations, support, refunds,|40%|10%|23%|Stop being overly nice to customers and giving everyone refunds.|
|Marketing/ sales|32%|39%|12%|See above points on demand. Airbnb can afford to spend less on marketing and maintain traffic.|
|Product development|17%|10%|12%|Get in line with industry|
|Admin/management|13%|5%|5%|idem|
|Total|102%|64%|60%|Resulting in a 40% margin|

I will start off with a brief intro into BF, then I will list off some emotional and cognitive biases that retail investors are notorious for exhibiting. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will become more self-aware of what you are doing and become that much closer to someone that doesn’t lose his rent money on a regular basis. 

**What is Behavioral Finance (BF)**

To put it in simplest terms, BF attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors. 

You are all familiar with traditional, neo-classical finance where it assumes investors are risk-averse (lol), maximize utility (level of satisfaction received from the consumption of goods and services), and the markets are efficient in every single way. BF essentially says that’s all bullshit because in reality, people are seldom rational and cannot possibly consider all available information when making a decision, therefore, the markets are not efficient at all. 

To put it in layman’s terms, just like two wrongs don’t make a right, BF states that stuffing a million retards on Robinhood doesn’t make an Einstein. 

**Emotional Bias**

1. Loss Aversion Bias: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to gains. This will cause people to hold on to failing securities. This is a big one on this sub. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for strong hands and all but recognize when you’re in a bad play and don’t be afraid to get out. 

2. Overconfidence Bias: Unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgement, and cognitive ability. This is a big one and is shown every time someone yolo their life savings on far OTM options. 

3. Self-Control Bias: Failure to act in pursuit of their long-term goals due to a lack of self-discipline. This is anyone in GME gang that paper handed and sold at open without realizing that the long term play is to bank on this company turning around starting in 20Q4 and triggering a short squeeze. 

4. Status Quo Bias: Doing nothing instead of making a change. Example are those that never closed their TSLA puts. 

5. Regret-Aversion Bias: Avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that decision will turn out poorly. Stop being a pussy. 

**Cognitive Errors**

1. Cognitive Dissonance: mental discomfort that occurs when new information conflicts with previously held beliefs. This is shown when people only notice information that confirm existing biases and ignore conflicting points of view. 

2. Conservation Bias: People maintain prior views by inadequately incorporating new information. Will often result in being too slow to update their viewpoints and end up bag holding major losses. A good example are those that diamond handed SPY puts in March. 

3. Confirmation Bias: people only look for and notice what confirms their own beliefs and ignore those that contradict. An example can be virtually any “gang” that existed in WSB history. Tanker gang, silver gang, etc. 

4. Representativeness Bias: people classify new information based on past experience and not realize that just because something happened in the past does not mean it is repeating itself right now. An example can be anytime someone compares the March crash to 08 or 1929. 

5. Anchoring Bias: Use of a psychological heuristic that influences the way people estimate probabilities. This is every time someone says stocks are at an ATH, why should I buy? Without looking at the fundamentals that drove the stock there to begin with

6. Mental Accounting Bias: Treating one sum of money differently to another equal sum. Money is money, get over it. 

7. Framing Bias: answering a question differently based on way it is asked. 

8. Availability Bias: people take a heuristic approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily outcome comes to mind. Everytime stocks dip 5-7% I guarantee you there will be posts saying the crash is here simply because people can easily remember March. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, before making a decision, ask yourself if any of these biases apply to you. If so, you are probably not thinking straight and acting like a total retard. All of these biases can be countered by having a clear head, understand your risk tolerance and return objectives, and having a clear long term strategy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Got some loss porn mixed in here too for fapping pleasure.

Tesla to the 🌑🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why the Market is becoming the Economy: A Tale of Two Liquidities (SPY, stimulus, repos) This is super long, so if you don't wanna read it skip to the TLDR.  This also isn't a revolutionary thesis, "we need stimmy!" but I wanted to breakdown why it's important, at least in my view.

**Long story short:** the importance of this year's booming rally has largely hinged on: a)increased liquidity through FED repo lending mechanisms and b) dramatically increased consumer opportunities created by enhanced UI benefits, and where people chose to spend it.  

**1) The rise and fall of FED liquidity via short term loans**

For those who were around in the halcyon days of the late spring and early summer, we witnessed SPY do some amazing things together.  For review, I noted two specific mechanisms that were largely behind the barrage of green dildos raining down daily:

**1a.) *Free money repo operations**:* to simplify it, this is the process by which financial entities borrow money from each other for overnight asset purchases; it's a closed, short term loan ecosystem.  This became a bloated and expensive process in 2019, leading to somewhat of a mini-crisis, and the FED stepped in to offer their own low interest short-term loans. When the March crash came, the FED sent this lending vehicle into hyperdrive, throwing hundreds of billions of dollars a week into low interest short-term loan operations for banks.  How low?

**Free. They were offering overnight swaps with banks, using treasury as collateral, and charging ZERO additional interest on them.**

[Typical Repo operation early 2020](https://i.imgur.com/TmbUXrR.jpg)
you see, IOER plus ZERO BASIS POINTS.  *Literally, free money.*

Since the Spring, SPY has petered out.  Up and down, boomer-esque gains have replaced the BTD logic of summer.  Below is the difference in price and percent for the first trading day in each month compared to the last.  Things got shaky in the fall. (note that it is typically assumed that FED balance sheet adjustments take about one-two months to show results, good or bad)

May to June: 280.43/303 = 8%
June to july: 303/ 309.28= 2% (note below)

July to August (3) = 309.28/ 328.74= **6.2%**

August to September= 328.74/ 351.19= **6.8%**

September to October = 351.19/ 337.04= **-4.19%**

October to November = 337.04/ 330.20= **2%**

November to December= 330.20/ 366.02= **10.84%** (note below)

**The 3 days preceding and following the election were responsible for 7.3% of the November rise, so Nov is something of an outlier. The 2% in June came due to the crash, which was caused by the very thing I'm solidifying--a change in the Fed overnight loan terms)

Also since the Spring, the amount of people participating in overnight Repo operations has petered out.  Why? Because it's not longer free money.  **The FED's bread and butter liquidity operation for short term loans changed their interest terms.  [This is so important that it was the largest catalyst for the June crash.  Stories broke on the 10th and 11th that the Fed would be  "tweaking" the overnight lending rates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-repo-idUSKBN23I39Z), from the "free money" 0 points over IOER to 5 points over on the overnight, and 10 points on the term.** Do the math; if the story breaks on the 11th stating the FED would be increasing the rate on their overnight loan operations, and the Street catches wind likely a day or two before that...what do you think causes the crash on the 11th?  The FED program has been steadily increasing to a standard +10 interest charge.

So, the FED has dried up it's free money overnight lending, an it would seem to coincide with SPY slowing down.

**1b.) The end of double pump Tuesdays**
Once upon a time I wrote about the "Double Pump"--typically on Tuesday--when the FED would offer both term AND overnight repo operations on the same day, at the IOER +0 (free money) rate.  However, once the interest rate climbed to +5 points it became obsolete; it's more common to see zero takers on repo/reverse repo operations than it is to see more than one taker, nowadays.  Tuesdays were guaranteed green at a 90% rate--and then FED lending practices changed, and poof.

The details of all this shit is boring, but the point is this: once the COVID crash hit, in order to grease the wheels to getting the market back on track the FED was employing multiple avenues to give financial entities money to play with mostly via its absurdly low-cost loan swap programs.


These repo lending programs becoming more expensive are apart of a larger general trend; the shrinking FED balance sheet.  Although in recent months they have lightly picked spending back up, we have flatlined from the huge jump we saw in March and April in response to the pandemic. 

[FED balance sheet YTD 2020](https://i.imgur.com/znnvilS.jpg)
Look at that level-off, this shit matters

**2) Stimulus play money go bye-bye**
Stimmy pumps aren't much, unless you're betting 0DTE, but the underlying importance of an economic stimulus that benefits consumers is. There are three simple measures signifying it's importance as a liquidity pump:

**2a.) Consumer spending**: when the stimulus began to hit in April/May, we saw a huge jump in consumer spending.  You remember the lines at WMT and TGT and shit.  In June, for example, consumer spending was expected to increase a little less than 2%--it went higher than 6%.

**2b.) Credit Card Debt begone**: people had so much extra money from the stimulus they paid off their credit cards https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201 .  This is a clear indication that the stimulus funds were having a positive spending affect.

**2c.) Consumer choices:** Used auto sales and home sales skyrocketed (link), indicating people were flush with excess cash for down payments, in addition to the ability to pay off debt.
https://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-pandemic-the-used-car-lot-is-hot-11593774001

**Conclusion**
So what the fuck am I saying?  I'm saying that in order for the market to not reflect and react to current (horrid) employment and opportunity metrics--common measures of economic health being decimated by the COVID/lockdown return-- one of these two external liquidity injections must continue; FED balance sheet ultra expansion, or stimulus injection.  While FED spending on QE is increasing slightly over the past few months, it's paltry in comparison March, April, and May, and is very unlikely to return to those levels.  This is why in every speaking engagement Powell makes it clear: we need a stimulus.

So, the answer to which liquidity injection can continue is the stimulus. Specifically, the enhanced unemployment benefits that, coupled with eviction moratoriums and rent/mortgage deferment, allow consumer spending and credit debt relief on a mass scale.  Regardless of the bickering, it is going to happen.  The enhanced UI will happen, in particular, because more widespread lockdowns are going to hurt jobs numbers, thus lending the Dems the leverage they need.  UI benefits are tied to employment, and even McConnell is acknowledging there is no way around that.

**I see a lot of people talking about the stimulus in the daily thread, so here are some basics:**
1) Direct payments are likely not happening this time, or at a depressed level (talk of $600)
2) UI enhancements will be reinstated at at least $300 extra weekly, backdated to December 1st
3) There will be another eviction moratorium extension, probably for 3, 4 months
4) It doesn't matter what the white house wants--the chain of approval goes House vote (Nancy), then Senate vote (McConnell).  Any vote in either house that hasn't been supported by the other chamber is DOA and pure political stunt.
5) The big hangup is corporate liability protection for Democrats (businesses, schools, hospitals want lawsuit immunity from COVID cases) and State and Local Government Aid for the Democrats (money to be used at the discretion of localities, including social programming, policing, education).
6) Its going to pass this negotiation cycle because it's tied to a government shutdown.


**Positions: Arming for the next round of stimulus**


SPY: stay away, honestly.  Even after the initial pump, there will still be several rounds of voting needed, between committees and chambers, each with it's own bad news cycle days and good news cycle days.


I'm also staying away from small cap trash and looking at companies who most benefit from restriction rules, integrated online systems well, or both.  I had a good sense this dip was coming yesterday, so I'm loading up on these at EOD:

Strong consumer-spending retail:
**WMT: 1/8 155c**
**TGT: 1/8 180c**

Consumer electronics that boomed in lockdown 1:

**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**

Once people realize that telehealth is here to stay, TDOC merger is actually dope as fuck, and vaccine logistics are going to take forever:
TDOC 12/24 200c
TDOC 1/15 205c

I just fucking like TOL, so 
**TOL 1/15 46c**

**TLDR: To stave off a bear market reflecting wider economic conditions, we need a continuation of either 0 interest FED short-term loan programs or an economic stimulus—stimulus is more likely. SPY, without these two things, has shown waning strength over the past few months.  Buy calls like the stimulus is coming in the next few weeks, but stay away from SPY generally and pick consumer-spending winners with dual in-person/online presence.**

**tl;dr: Not bearish yet. PLTR is in a fib battle, bulls need to get it above $29, but coming down to $25-26.20 isn't necessarily a reason to bail, provided it makes a pivot there**

Previous update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8pmkg/pltr\_fib\_held\_first\_profit\_target\_is\_still\_39/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8pmkg/pltr_fib_held_first_profit_target_is_still_39/)

To recap, the major fib of the entire move is still in play, with a first profit target of $39.3, denoted with **(arrow 'A')**

In the previous thread, I said to watch for a bearish reversal at $29. Well, we bazooka'd through $29 and got within < 10% of the ATH. However, look how quickly it was rejected and came back to the $29 range. This was/is the only sell-side fib remaining and technically it has been 'broken' by the spike to $31, but the way the price has come down in today's session makes me consider it still in play. It has a profit target of $18.22ish **(arrow 'B'),** **which just so happens to line up with the 0.618 retracement of the major fib**, increasing the likelihood of the $18.22 level becoming a major pivot IF it were to get there. The unfolding price action also looks like it would create a clean 'ABC' down which is typical of corrections.

The good news: in order for this sell-side fib to get down to $18, it will first need to get through the 0.5-0.618 ($25-26.20) range of December's move up, which is the buy zone of December's move with a first profit target of 33.5 **(arrow 'C')**. Note: this target is at PLTR's ATH which may provide some resistance, (due to simple support/resistance and also if fib traders take profit there).

To the fib trader, there is no reason to be bearish on the price action *yet,* the big tell will be whether PLTR makes a turn **above** $25ish.

**If $25 doesn't hold, I anticipate further downside, with first support being the pivot low at $21.20 and the major support at $18.20. PLTR at $18.20 is what is called "a gift"**

The way I'm expressing this trade is with a Jan 15'21 30/35 bull call, which I opened for $0.9_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I doing this right? Sold Pltr and CRSR to buy T @ 31.5 & $32 December & January calls. So I just opened my IRA this month, and funded with $400 before I deposit the full amount selling off some positions in my main account. My first 2 trades were PLTR and CRSR on Monday. Tuesday, I decided those were not enough, sold them, and rolled into $T (AT&T). Bought $31.5 and 32 December calls and some January - Feb $32. Maybe some of you say the $31.5 on the frontpage of best performers. I got the options later in my retirement account than my main unfortunately due to it not occurring to me that I had one initially. 

$T is a dream come true for investors. Here we have a nice boomer stock with a great dividend, and the HBO deal with WB represents a paradigm shift with some real juice. You know what Netflix did to cable? This is how significant the HBO deal is to show all WB movies in 2021.  I also have 7k in $T in my real, non retirement account, including $100 shares. 

The safe play here is the January - February options, because as people slowly awaken to the significance of the WB deal, this baby is going up, but it could be a more gradual process. Options are still incredibly cheap for the longer options owing to $T's traditional stability, but that wont be so tomorrow. $11.4 billion of box office tickets are sold in North America alone every year. Now HBO and friends are going to vacum this up. Also felt good to get my $31.5 on the list of best options the day before, but I didn't get in early enough owing to an 11AM meeting that interrupted my "DD". 
Ignore this rocket ship at your own peril, or, just buy stock, would take some effort to lose money on it over a multi-month holding period. Do not buy strikes farther than $35. The stock doesnt need to moon for your options to go to mars. Even 10% on the stock would be a colossal gain on the options. 

Stock moves up $2, the current December 32 C becomes a 10 bagger. Other options move less but this is just to emphasize just how little the stock needs to move to hit 100% on all the options listed.

QS - Jan 15 2021

Sell 75 Put,Buy 45 Put - Net credit 2300,Collateral 3000

Sell 50 Call,Buy 75 call - Net Credit 1300,No need of collateral since it is covered from credit put

Effectively you will be getting a credit of 3600 with 3000 collateral. You can pocket 600 free money and if stock expires above 50 you will make additional 500 due to the call leg.QS is in EV hype zone and its shorted too much and with the good news yesterday the stock has some upside with both short squeeze coming and fundamental play.Even if the stock crashes and goes to zero you end making 600$ profit. So this is it guys get richer and treat me and if anyone finds a loophole in this strategy let me know.I am balls deep in this.

One risk is getting the 50 call assigned and with this volatility its not gonna happen.Even if the call gets assigned we can quickly close the stocks and 75 call leg and end up making more than 1100$ for each contract

I did 300 contracts of them in multiple accounts.Screenshot attached

At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer – relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. 

**Financial wise, the company has**

\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**

\- **86% subscription revenue**

\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** 

\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**

**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** 

\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**

\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**

\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**

\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** 

\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**

**Notable market successes:**

\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**

\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**

\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** 

What is C3.AI

C3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. 

**Two primary software solutions:**

**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**

**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**

The market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. 

**C3.AI is then able to** 

**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**

**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**

**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**

Real world user case:

Engie – largest power producer in the world with

\- 114.4 GW power production capacity

\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money

\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties 

With the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**

\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value

\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value

\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment 

\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months 

**Revenue model**

\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**

\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**

\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**

\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**

In the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**

Their AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace & defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** 

\- **Anti-money laundering**

\- **COVID-19 Data lake**

\- **AI CRM**

\- **Energy management**

\- **Fraud detection**

\- **Inventory optimization**

\- **Predictive maintenance**

\- **Production schedule optimization**

\- **Readiness**

\- **Sensor health**

\- **Supply network risk** 

**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.**

Grocery delivery on the other hand has seen a big increase during COVID, and that looks like its here to stay for the most part. Grocery delivery makes more sense: do it once or twice a month, very convenient, lots of competition between third parties (instacart, shipt, etc.) and proprietary services (Walmart Plus).

Be careful with these IPOs opening 100%+ above IPO price!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BFT (Paysafe) (Reposted: was removed for mentioning creep toe currency)

Blackstone and CVC have agreed to list Paysafe at a $9bn valuation via a merger with a blank-cheque company launched by billionaire Bill Foley (Chairman and former CEO of Fidelity)

Foley Trasimene Acquisition II, the special purpose acquisition company that listed in August on the New York Stock Exchange raising $1.47bn, will merge with Paysafe in one of the largest Spac deals to date.

Mr Foley’s investment vehicle will also raise close to $2bn in additional funds from institutional investors, including hedge fund Third Point and Hedosophia, the company set up by British investor Ian Osborne who has launched multiple Spacs with Chamath Palihapitiya (The IPOB guy)

Paysafe, which has been dominant in handling online gambling transactions as well as helping retailers process customers’ online payments, was acquired by Blackstone and CVC for £3bn in 2017. As part of the deal with Mr Foley’s Spac the private equity duo will retain a stake in Paysafe."

positions: pltr & gme stocks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Diamond hands, paper hands, and autism. Alright fuckers, I'm back for more unsolicited advice. I'm here to discuss diamond Hands, paper hands, and why blindly throwing these terms around is getting a lot of people's portfolios (even you can even call them that) murdered.

&#x200B;

Diamond hands and paper hands are subjective terms. It's diamond hands when you boldly hold and pull out a big gain, but it's just autism when you boldly hold and go to zero. It's paper hands when you take a comfortable gain early, but the stock still keeps mooning, not when you sell a net positive on a sinking ship/something you didn't really believe in and just played for the momentum. This goes back to my previous post on the subject: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5gg38/you\_have\_to\_know\_when\_to\_pull\_out\_even\_if\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5gg38/you_have_to_know_when_to_pull_out_even_if_you/)

&#x200B;

I think people get these confused here. Real diamond hands is knowing you're on board the right ship even though people are temporarily getting off. Real paper hands is taking a gain way too early or selling emotionally off of one temporary piece of bad news, dip etc. But blindly throwing these terms around is getting people killed on here. It's making people lose their life savings in the blink of an eye. Why would you let the opinions of anonymous retards influence anything you do?

Shorts and bears bet big on this company  (Biocryst pharmaceuticals) hoping it would fail in 1-2 ways; not getting FDA approval, or having to dilute their shares in order to get more cash to keep operating.

&#x200B;

Pubmatic then sells it to:

\- advertisers and agencies

\- demand side platforms (like The Trade Desk, which has a PE of 300)

\- DSPs which consists of bigger advertisers / ad agencies

So... why do owners work with PubMatic vs Google Ads?

\- maybe more  revenue (Google takes a massive cut)

\- maybe better payment terms (faster payments)

SBE-WT or SBE-WS depending on your broker are warrants that allow you to purchase a share of sbe stock @ 11.50.  

The catch is you cannot actually exercise the warrants until roughly 30 days from the actual merger close date.  

Right now, SBE is trading at $43.  SBE-WS are @ 13.20.  If you were able to exercise the warrants now, they would be trading at roughly $31.5.  

What does this mean?  It means that if you buy the warrants now and the merger completes on the 15th, then SBE will need to fall below $24.7 by Jan 15thish for you to lose money.  

But wait, you can buy a SBE Jan 15 40$ P.  So essentially you lock in profits.  There is some slight risk in the timing because the puts expire jan 15th and that is very close to the date the shares become exercisable.

&#x200B;

TLDR  buy SBE-WT @ \~13.5,  Also buy 1/15 SBE 40 P @ 7.5-8 in equal amounts.  

Total cost $21.5.  Then if SBE falls you let the puts exercise, which puts you short SBE stock @$40  Then you exercise the warrants + $11.50 so your cost is $33 to cover the puts and you made $7.

What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let’s talk about this and more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.

[Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories. 

While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.

The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.

Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin. 

Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)

I wouldn’t touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.

The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.

Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don’t think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn’t touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.

In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.

In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.

Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.

While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.

Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.

And finally let’s talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX. 

On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales. 

So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

Good luck to everyone in the stock market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/q7rHvL5) are mixed while writing this post with the DOW and SP500 gaining ground while the Nasdaq futures are just down for the moment.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB: Lets demand a GME share holder meeting Hey  guys, any of you that listened to the earnings/guidance from Game Stop know  how retarded management is.... We are all banking on an evolution or  chewie-fication of Game Stop rather than boomers doubling down on a dying  business and praying a new console cycle will save them. In light of the  new revelation that they are "Creating" 100m shares out of thin are to  either fight off cohens hostile take over, or to fuck us when the  squeeze takes off so they can profit off of us i was trying to figure  out how we as share holders can fuck over sherman and the fucks with him  and i found this gem...

"The  board of directors has the power to call general meetings and the   majority of general meetings will be called by the directors (S302 of   the Companies Act 2006).

The  members also have the ability to demand a general meeting.  Section 303  of the Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to call a  general  meeting once the company has received requests from members   representing 5% of the paid up share capital those entitled to vote at   general meetings of the company.

Under  S304, the directors must call a general meeting within 21 days  of  receiving such a valid request and provide for the general meeting to   be held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the notice of   the meeting.

If the directors do  not call a meeting as required to do so, under  S304, the members who  requested the meeting, or any of them representing  more than one half  of the total voting rights of all of them, may  themselves call a  general meeting.

The Companies Act  2006 also gives the court the ability to order a  meeting and where a  resigning auditor has given a statement of the  circumstances connected  with his resignation, that auditor is also  entitled to call on the  directors of the company to convene a general  meeting for the purposes  of receiving and considering an explanation of  those circumstances.

For  those of you too retarded to see where this is going - all of us  holding shares should write a letter and demand a share holder  meeting.... WSB holds around 5% and im sure Cohen and Burry would help  out and boom... we get to force Game Stop/Sherman to address Cohens letter and  we get to ask the questions.. be the big man with the microphone... we  get to swing our dicks while looking at swim suit magazines.. we... oh  right i forgot to take my adult hyperactivity dis... oh look a butterfly... any how... I think  it would be a  great headline "WSB calls share holder meeting"....  What do you guys  thinks?

**Edit:** For those of you throwing shade - im still green... I bought in at around $10... so unless the dip is that hard - Im still winning.....

I just want a god damn short squeeze... and I think it will be a cool headline "WSB demands share holder meeting"... additionally, it will be just as much fun to ask retarded questions to the board such as - "in your opinion do Stonks only go up, and if true, why did your stonk go down?" among other fun things to fuck with the boomers before making them address what we really want - Cohen leading the ecomm charge.  


**Edit 2:** some of you tards haven't been paying attention... so here is a link to another post - its how i got the 5% [**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb\_owns\_58\_of\_gme\_gme\_survey\_update/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/)

Edit 3: Im still at work, so i cant work on templets or anything so enjoy this meme i made in the mean time.  https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7xxdyd_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR at these Valuations TL;DR: My admittedly slightly 🐻🌈 on PLTR at these prices. Sell puts at around 24 if you have no current position in underlying. Sell CC at around 30-33 if you do.

**My play on PLTR**

I'd really like to see a pullback to \~25 (or lower ideally) ... then I would load up on calls, shares, and sell a bunch of put credit spreads. I like PLTR, but I hate these valuations... it may be I don't know enough about the company, but I have friends who work with it in DC. The problem is that the software platform requires heavy customization for every client... this is a big scaling issue..and I cannot find any data on how PLTR plans to scale to justify valuations at the SNOW level (which is where this thing would need to go to be a huge money-maker at these prices).

**The major problems I see with PLTR are:**

* Highly dependent on govts. Palantir has to be careful with profits so that it doesn't reek of perceived abuse (irrespective of actual value). They risk inquiries, GAO (Government Audit Office) audits, downsizing, and potential cancellations depending on the internal pressure. I believe this is why they are angling for surveillance, etc as those contracts are less transparent by nature, which mitigates this challenge some
* Customizations - makes it tough to scale big time a la SNOW
* Lockup Period - there will be major downwards pressure on the stock when this ends mid-February. 

**The good:**

* Rockstar management and backing
* Super-compelling offering with what is to be the major problems at govts/corps (parsing signal from noise in the data due to data overload)
* Should be majorly profitable

**Summary**

I like PLTR. I am a bit wary at these prices, since it's tough to gauge if this is a pure SaaS or a consulting company. Given Thiel's involvement, and heavy insistence on platform plays, I am inclined for this to be the former. I'd like to see a bit of pullback first and IV to come down. In the meantime, selling weekly puts to take advantage of the sky high IV.

Any other insights? Anything I missed and should be added?

"It's going to be a truly innovative financial instrument," said Bill Ackman "plus, please refer to me as Spacdaddy for the remainder of the interview".

The SPACAC will aim to purchase a company that aims to purchase a company that can add value to investors' portfolios. "We're looking to find a company that's looking to find a company that is an adolescent unicorn, a full-grown minotaur, dragon puppy, or feisty dachshund." Spacdaddy said.

The company has announced its intention to find a company with the intention to merge with it and then something else before "2100-ish".

"We're in no rush," Spacdaddy clarified. "This is a process, it takes time. I'm not certain I'll be alive by the time this company that's going to buy a company buys a company that's actually going to make or sell a thing. That's okay. None of us may be alive then. This is how markets assess value and it takes time."

Money^(3)'s ticket is $BRRRR. Shares/warrants/options went on sale today and the price is already shooting skyward.

Warren Buffett, who has played a large position on Berkshire's most recent 13f close to the chest to this point, has been revealed to be a secret investor in the SPACAC.

"Fuck it, I don't even know what the fuck is going on anymore," Buffet lamented with an estranged and distant look on his face. "I just gave Spacdaddy a lot of money and told him to bring me back more money later. I don't know how much I gave him, but I know it was cash."

Buffett used literal cash (mostly 5's) to buy a 14.7 billion dollar position in BRRRR including \~$417 million in loose change.

"Having a credible investor fully on board with what we're doing here shines a positive light on all the good work our 1,400 employees are doing," Spacdaddy said.

In a recent bit of positive news for BRRRR, the company has increased it's value though a Reverse Non-merger Letter of Intent. This is a technique whereby the SPACAC declares intent to not purchase a SPAC that intends to purchase a certain sort of equity.

BRRRR announced that it will not be acquiring a company that is aiming to acquire a company that does retail video rental, physician assisted suicide, snake grooming, children's beauty pageants, or Stripe. Though the news about Stripe (and snake grooming) hit investors hard, the likelihood of BRRRR becoming a company that becomes a company that produces EV's sent the price up 27% in its first day of trading._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The "P" in Pfizer stands for "Puts" 😂 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AIRBNB is gonna dominate the future I see all these discussions going on how cities restricting AIRBNB in their cities, and for that reason alone should not be bought. LAME! Look at the history of tech companies that disrupt industries, they have not only disrupted the Industry but dominated (amazon, google, visa,). AIRBNB is in, younger people do not even know a hotel companies name anymore. Back in the day when you came back from vacation saying a brand name hotel was a status display to your friends, now people look at you as a tech tard.

The big short. The Jet 7 Xtra Flex catheter from Penumbra has killed more patients than all of its competitors... COMBINED. On top of that management has refused to recall, and it has been shown that management created the false identity "Antik Bose" to publish research confirming the device's safety. This research was used in premarket approval for the catheter.

Steven Brooks, with 6 years experience in the FDA Office of Device Evaluation predicts a class 1 recall with material effect on revenues: [https://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Formal-assessment-on-Penumbra.pdf](https://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Formal-assessment-on-Penumbra.pdf)

Report Part 2 (Elaborate research fraud): [http://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/QCM-on-Antik-Bose-Final.pdf](http://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/QCM-on-Antik-Bose-Final.pdf)

Not included in the reports:

After Antik Bose was exposed as a false identity over 5 of his social profiles were deleted. The timing of this eliminates the possibility that the false identity was not created by Penumbra management.

The company did not issue a press release in response to the first report in response to deaths, but after Antik Bose was exposed, we received this little gem from the CEO:

“This attack by sleazy short sellers QCM reads like an internet conspiracy written by teenagers. It is impossible to dispute the facts, because there are no facts.” 

Why no press release on the first report in response to deaths, but they want to respond like this to the second report? This company is going to the shitter.

Price target is 50$, do your own research._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ XOM now is like buying Banks In 2009. Once in a lifetime imo _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA S&P Purchase Chart - 73B in TSLA purchased around 12/18 - Where will it come from? Is it possible? At what cost? All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.

**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**

When only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**

This gets progressively larger, as the price increases.

[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)

They have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**

**How are they going to do it?**

1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares
2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)
3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.

**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**

**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.

I believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.

This would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.

Then there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.

Some of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.

Also look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.

I think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.

That would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.

**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**

I think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**

There is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.

Also, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.

**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.

I am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.

**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. 

**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.

The S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.

**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.

Their biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** 

**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.

**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg). How much of that can come home to US indexes on 12/18?  They are asleep for our trading hours.

700C, 800C, 900C, 1000C 12/24

Hell, I'd buy some 1250C for .20 if some fool would write them. ($20 on a long shot of getting it sold at the right time for 2-40k profit)

Edit: My original post mistakenly included the 6.6T in index benchmarked funds to the total S and P tracked funds._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME call gains!

1. “Boo-fuckin-hoo, I lost $Xk on GME, should I sell?”
2. “HAHAHAHA I’m fucking loving this, GME retards got what they deserved, fuck yeah, bruuuh!!!”

Lemme deal with #1 first, because these are still decent humans. 3 words, tard. Sell. Motherfucking. CC’s. How much are you down per share? $2? $3? More? Doesn’t matter. You have 100 shares, you have a fighting chance. Time to join theta gang. Sure, sometimes they give us shit, but their strategies work. So, Sell-To-Open a covered call for each 100 share bag you’re holding, find a strike price above or at your cost basis, chose and expiry and boom - some amount of dollars goes back into your account. Good, now your cost basis is $X minus the value of the call. If GME recovers and shoots past $X, your shares get called away, but you made profit. If it doesn’t, if it trades sideways or goes down, theta/delta drive the price of the call down, ao buy that shit back for a net profit and repeat. Remember, if you have a multiple of 100 shares, you can still fight. First rule - don’t lose money. 

Now, #2. You fuckers make me sick. I mean, sure, we don’t feel sorry for you when you lose money, you dance with the market, you accepts the risks, but there’s literally no good reason to be happy about it, let alone ecstatic. Is your wife less ugly and your dick longer because some sad shmuck loses his rent money on GME? Is their misfortune somehow making your life less of a shithole? Are you no longer living in your parent’s basement because an autist bought GME calls when fucking everyone said “buy shares”? Be a decent fucking human being and don’t gloat. Oh, and another thing. That company still sold one billion motherfucking dollars of stuff in a quarter, despite the shithow we live in. What did you do this quarter? Some of you are gonna point me to your massive gains, but I say to fuck with that - you did it with massive help of lady luck, some other company’s hard work and your hand in your pants, GME made their $$ from hard work, that makes them respectable, and you a lucky speculator that’s gonna lose their shirt one day while GME still survives.

# TL;DR;
1 - stop whining, put your big boy pants on and either DCA or sell CCs.
2 - eat a dick.

THEY PUMPED IT IN ADVANCE.

Ok so we all agree that c3.ai is a trash company with no future prospects whatsoever. They were slammed right into the ground by the pandemic because only boomer companies used their services. Competing against both Doordash AND Airbnb on the same day, they should get crushed, right? WRONG.

C3.AI will be getting the "AI" ticker. This means that boomers will have to spell 2 letters less to purchase this stock. AI. It's a catchy ticker. And that's just what it needs for us to make a cozy 20%. Remember the piece of shit pump and dump named ROCKET? It'll be exactly like that. This stock is going to go straight into the moon and the reason is 2 letters short.

Edit: Everyone who downvotes this works for DASH. IPO starts on the 9th._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Please explain to me why PTON is a $100 stonk (I will explain why it is $hit) Hi tards,

I believe that PTON is the next 2014 GoPro. If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.

I dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years.

&#x200B;

TLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self. It is what happens when you put 20in rims on your stationary bike and bolt on a 50in Plasma. There is only one direction for this rocket bike to go and that is down.

Market cap is $45B and their projected 2020 yearly revenue is $750M, so on the high side but not crazy high. While revenue grew 53% y/y, losses grew 213%. y/y. I.e. money is burning faster than they can make it. Even after taking out stock based compensation and looking purely at operating expenses, they lose $141M a quarter. Yet unity is mature company, almost 20 years old. It’s not in the R&D phase/early growth. It already has a >50% share of the mobile and VR gaming markets. Wtf? So they are spending like crazy to try to grow? They actually can afford to. They have zero debt and 1.7B (billion!) in cash, thanks to going public. That cash represents plenty of runway. Yet even in their first quarterly report, they do indicate they continue to grow by acquisition and might issue more shares to fuel that growth.

On **$TSLA**

As we all already know the news on shorting TSLA by Michel Burry came out Dec 3, 2020

From his standpoint on the position, the argument is that the price of TSLA is overvalued and there should be a correction made in the market. The profitability of TSLA and the rate of expected profitability is high but however, they are not on the rate of profitability for their projected Q1-Q2.

He showed on his tweet about the trade; The total Revenue, Market Capitalization, and EBIT of 32 companies in the auto sector and compared them to TSLA. It shows us that TSLA is underperforming and is in fact overvalued.

I will now go in-depth of my review of TSLA and break the companies performance using multiple financial benchmarks.

In this review I will use companies in the auto sector, TSLA’s direct competition and EV ETF’s I will, however, account for the future probability of the company since I think that it has high importance.

Bellow are key benchmarks shown: ( total Revenue, Market Cap, And Ebit)

https://preview.redd.it/2xd9g29de3461.jpg?width=1815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80a05b1a18c5d96795caa2cc5ffdac0e57e405f4

&#x200B;

In this spreadsheet, we can see the comparison between the total  (Revenue/Market Cap/Ebit) of the whole auto sector. and in compression to TSLA.  From this, we can determine that tesla in Market Cap alone beats all other Auto manufacturers.  Their EBIT this year is about 1.7 Billion to the 40 Billion total. But does the company truly have the potential and the value that it is at?

***Bellow, I will add more benchmarks to TSLA compared to the industry to see the true value in the company and its financials and external sources of value to TSLA that would make this trade go in the wrong direction.***

https://preview.redd.it/8v48shyje3461.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1038c71293b90ca474810c614651038aec6e30

&#x200B;

If we look purply at the (share price) we clearly see the massive 867% yearly gain on TSLA. However, if we look at the metrics where the company excelled in would be P/E, Price/Book.

Where the problem is would be the profit margins. Both EPS and EBIT metrics are low for the value of the company.  That is the main problem of the overvaluation of TSLA is that they don't make enough profit to validate their share price. We can say that the future value is there however in the short term the price is moving in a way that would indicate to us a bubble. And a correction that should affect the price of the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/8bdwsdmle3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e57b3f2277c41f216b8e29a3d46aff1a4ce1b0

&#x200B;

Here I demonstrate mixed metrics on all the 32 companies in the auto sector. To show how TSLA is underperforming in most of the benchmarks. This is to show where the company has overvalued and how.

* MKT cap ($616b)
* Accounts payable turnover:  ( The accounts payable turnover ratio is a short term measure used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.)       -Here TSLA has a rate of 5.43 that states to us; they are taking time to pay to their creditors and compared to other companies in the auto sector are underperforming in this benchmark.
* Profit Margin: -2.56% of the cost of production exceeds total sales. TSLA has more costs than they are able to cover by their profit. Other companies that have a negative profit margin in the sector all have a share price lower than their valuation.
* Gross profit: $4.07B where the value is $616B this indicator alone shows us that the company is way overvalued. We can argue that they are in the Tech sector more than in manufacture or cars. But however, their model of operations demonstrate to us that they are heavily weighted on that side of the business and not tech.
* Supply chain revenue: 0.19% this benchmark demonstrates that they are not generating enough revenue from their supply chain operations.
* Inventory days: ( how many days on average does it take to take 'product to market') 59.3 days Higher than the average of the auto sector.
* Inventory growth: 14.09 in the past 12M
* ROA: -1.96% losing money on their return on assets.

But Burry's target price would be around $300-$350

&#x200B;

Q1 of 2021 shows us the options volumes where the market is pumping more volume in the lower level of the stock price.

I strongly agree with the numbers and that this stock is overvalued but has a lot of extrinsic potential and value in the future, but there should be a market correction that would take place and we can profit from this move. TSLA is a great company and has a bright history but at the levels, it is at now. I personally do not see it going higher. And this would be my break around of Michel Burry's short trade on TSLA._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [DD] GME shareholder DD and support thread This is for shareholders only, if you bought calls expiring before late Jan you probably can't read since almost every DD before this told you to buy shares or LEAPs.

So anyway after GME management has shown themselves to be as retarded as we are, I thought I'd share a few things for the newbies to help cope and recoup losses after today's shit show. if you read my previous post you would've expected a dump after Q3 earnings, although I have to admit I was expecting a 10% dump, not a 17% dump. That shelf offering was completely unexpected and the only valid reason for having it IMO would be for management to sell some shares during a squeeze to help raise funds. There are a few other reasons that people brought up that I thought made sense, no need for me to repeat it here. 

Fundamentally the earnings were pretty much as expected, a better than expected loss was pretty much priced in and things look like they're on track for Q4. Management closed more unprofitable stores, reduced inventory, sold their private jet (lol), and e-commerce is up. Risks to that outlook would be a restart of lockdowns and stimulus not being passed on time. Remember that IWM and many other ETFs hold quite a lot of GME shares, so a dump in those means we dumping as well. Don't forget to think about the risk of an overall market dump, since we are getting close to dec OPEX with record low put/call ratios, this market is being driven up by call buying and MM hedging can dump just as hard as they pump. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that'll take place between late dec- early Feb, watch for changes in option positioning and VIX term structure for clues.

Between now and Q4, the only catalyst for a durable pump would be the announcement of deals like the one with MSFT (there are rumors of a deal with SONY, not likely IMO), reports of VERY strong sales of consoles (good isn't good enough). We will likely start to have a slow ramp-up leading up to the earnings. These are your reasons to bag hold. 

People keep on asking RC to start a takeover but I doubt that will happen, in fact, I think RC might just sell his stake, since it's already up like 300%. Don't make any significant moves based on speculations on what RC might do.

For the immediate near term, figure out how to sell covered calls if you haven't already, selling weeklies can help bring down your cost basis, especially while IV is high. iBorrow shows borrow costs at 50%, which is near ATH I think, we might get a small but significant short-covering rally, sell your calls into these rallies. On the other hand, WSB might FOMO into weekly puts, which will also inevitably backfire but drag prices down in the process, take advantage of this by finding put walls near support and selling puts at a price you're comfortable DCA-ing at. 

Keep your eyes on the prize, which IMO really just come down to a new console cycle, the fact that there is a shortage of consoles right now just means people will be forced to shop at GME when other giants like AMZN or WMT runs out of stock. Keep an eye on any news about logistics and supply chain, if the giants get the upper hand in procuring new consoles, that will seriously damage the bull thesis

&#x200B;

Good luck retards_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It should be illegal for a company to be both authorized to buy back shares and have an ATM shelf offering outstanding (GME) But I don't make the rules and it should be obvious that GME is getting ready to profit off of a short squeeze should one happen by either Cohen forcing a vote OR by GME yeeting their 100 mil authorization in before Buyden gets inaugurated and the Dems (possibly) try to make share buybacks illegal or something

Long GME

Also someone please explain to me how diluting makes it harder for Cohen to take over coz I just saw GME say they were diluting by 10% but they knocked 17% off of their market cap. Doesn't that make it easier for Cohen to take whatever controlling stake since now the market cap is cheaper and isn't a controlling stake like 50% of the company or something I don't get it. I really think this at the shelf offering is preparation to take advantage of a short squeeze

On the one hand it caps how high the short squeeze is gonna go

On the other hand it incentivizes GME's management to get the party started since GME's balance sheet is about to get even better if they trigger one soon with an onslaught of good news._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I YOLO’d EVERYTHING I HAD ON PLTR.

GAME CHANGER!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Earnings Call Having actually listened to the entirety of the earnings call, it seems that, despite the downwards pressure, GME might actually be preparing itself rather well for the short squeeze. That said, I hope you autists were in fact in with shares, and not calls: otherwise, u r fuk. 

But back to the point: there was one very interesting pair of questions posed during the call: the first related to why GME would be planning to sell more shares ($100million’s worth). The answer was given with remarkable force compared to most of the others, and was also quite clearer: it was emphasized that GME did NOT NEED THE MONEY: it was simply an option being considered for the sole possible purpose of “increasing liquidity.” The reason they gave was in case the beer flu hit them hard again. With the vaccine coming, this seems like horse shit. To translate their likely intention for gay bears: if in fact there is a short squeeze, they would be primed to capitalize off of it by selling off some shares at a crazy good price. In addition, when asked if they would be buying back more shares in general, they said “it would not be off the table”: and I’m pretty certain that other $100 million left for share buybacks by the end of this fiscal year hasn’t been used yet. I think they’ve definitely got their heads out of the sand, and I look forward to their continued success.
Continued success, you ask? Yes. Their fourth quarter, if what they said is true, might be the first profitable quarter they’ve had in years. Good luck, everyone.

**TLDR; Twilio is a cloud services and communication platform.** The company's software helps app developers embed voice, text and video, and facilitates communication between cloud-based platforms. Demand for that software has risen due to the pandemic, which has reduced face-to-face contact. **Firms have price targets as big as $550 and Alex M from Baron Funds is super super long the stock. Along with Fastly (FSLY), this is a very safe and solid 20-30% growth stock in the next 3 months.**

Equities research analysts expect that Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) will announce sales of $453.46 million for the current fiscal quarter, [**Zacks**](https://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1) reports. Eight analysts have provided estimates for Twilio's earnings, with estimates ranging from $450.07 million to $458.00 million. Twilio reported sales of $331.22 million during the same quarter last year, which indicates a positive year-over-year growth rate of 36.9%. The firm is expected to issue its next quarterly earnings results on Wednesday, February 3rd.

Investors clearly believe Twilio has established itself as a vital service. The company's stock price has tripled this year, boosting Lawson's fortune to an estimated $2.3 billion. Lawson recently talked by video to The Associated Press.

On the other hand, there were a total of 63 hedge funds with a bullish position in TWLO a year ago. With the smart money's positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few notable hedge fund managers who were increasing their holdings considerably (or already accumulated large positions). "

"Twilio added 8,000 customers in the quarter, growing its customer base by 20% year-over-year. Dollar-based net expansion rate of existing customers clocked in at an impressive 137%. Revenues rose 52% year-over-year. Operating margins expanded 285 basis points. What was an operating loss in the year ago quarter, swung to a profit this quarter — marking the third consecutive quarter of positive operating profits."

" In 2021, we will get widespread distribution of multiple Covid-19 vaccines, which will spark consumer behavior normalization and a rebound in general economic activity.

Time to move your funds back to the promised land._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Previewing This Week's IPOs The December IPO finale is finally here. This week's repertoire includes six IPOs and two SPACs altogether expecting to raise $7.2 billion. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) will be leading the way, with Airbnb planning to raise $2.44 billion from the sale of its Class A stock, and Doordash going for $3.1 billion.

Airbnb

By being responsible for over 327 million bookings in 2019, this home-sharing start-up company is the market leader when it comes to short-term rentals. Even with many canceled bookings and much lower interest than before the pandemic, Airbnb managed to rebound from COVID-19 and show positive free cash flow. Airbnb's investors include Sequoia Capital, Silver Lake, Founders Fund, Greystar Real Estate, Sixth Street, DST Global, and Accel. The company has raised a total of $5.8 billion.

DoorDash

DoorDash already raised $2.26 billion from SVF Fast, Sequoia Capital, and Greenview Investment. This delivery service giant counts over 390,000 merchants, over 18 million users, and 1 million ‘Dasher' delivery persons. New users are acquired through online marketing and word of mouth recommendations. The company's strategy to have high expenses in sales and marketing departments finally resulted in generating a sharp increase in revenues. This efficiency rate is calculated as the amount of additional revenue is generated from one dollar of expenses in sales and marketing. This ratio has doubled to 2.2x in the latest reporting period. Even before the pandemic, restaurant digital orders have been steadily growing 23% annually (on average) since 2013. The COVID-19 pandemic has just accelerated this trend.

C3.ai

C3.ai (NYSE:AI), an AI software provider for accelerating digital transformation, plans to raise $504 million in its IPO, at a $4.3 billion market cap. The company's focus is on predictive maintenance, inventory optimization, energy management, customer relationship management, precision health, and anti-money laundering, which all result in a learning software that aims to help businesses make better decisions. The company's latest financials can be summarized as a growing revenue with a decelerated growth rate, high levels of gross profit with uneven gross margin, reduced operating losses, and a glimpse of positive cash flow seen in operations.

Certara

Certara (NASDAQ:CERT) is a leader in biosimulation helping to reduce cycle times, lower costs, and improve outcomes for patients, during the drug discovery and development processes. The company has 1,600 clients across 60 countries, including global biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and regulatory agencies.

The company manufactures and distributes stated products through its subsidiaries, and it serves customers in the U.S. and Canada, with a focus on the cannabis industry. The company reported both profit and accelerated growth during the first nine months of the year.

PubMatic

Last but not least, an AdTech platform PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ:PUBM) is also joining the public market as it plans to raise $100 million. The market cap is $953 million. The company specializes in the development and implementation of online advertising software and strategies.

YES, you read that correctly.

OVER 200% YOY growth in revenues. I have seen companies BLOWING OUT revenues by 30-50% and that is considered really good. But over 200%? That is like a company latching onto Elon's rocket ship and trying to go to Mars ok?

Net income was up 18 times YOY: Now, are they cooking the books or something? 18 TIMES? after doing extensive research on this company, everything is so crazy and the growth is just beginning.

Now retards, it has had a crazy run but it did consolidate with RSI resting at healthy level. Positive divergence and this shit is about to take off.

If I can predict the MEME energy coming from FUTU correctly, this is the combination of Peter Thiel + Elon Musk.

Today, it started its run again and I think this is headed to $50 and $60 in the very short term.

Now you autists gotta decide... Will you go to the moon with FUTU or will you just be a crybaby that you are, standing on the sidelines?

The 17 million households Represent $5 trillion in toxic assets. So I accidently did a DD today, inspired by the sources of this [Washington Post Story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/). The numbers behind on mortgage/rent come from [This Census Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp19.html#tables). The unpaid rent/mortgage number comes from [a Philly Fed Study](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/household-rental-debt-during-covid-19.pdf) estimate that the average household behind will owe ~$5,800 and multiplying it by the census numbers for behind on rent/mortgage. The real numbers may be as low 1/3 that of my estimate, but $100 billion makes for a good title. The census numbers lag a few weeks (Nov 11-23) so there also the possibility that I have slightly underestimated. 

Looking at the numbers a different way, in terms of the numbers of people eligible for eviction/foreclosure come Jan 1 when the national moratorium is lifted, the Nov 11-23 numbers represent a 45+ day delinquency. We get close to 70 million people using the raw household numbers from the census data, multiplied by the household size. One mitigating factor here is that some lenders are choosing to tack on owed mortgage payments to end the of the loan instead of seeking immediate repayment. Assuming half of the ~~30 million~~ 8 million delinquent mortgages are given the option to defer payments to the end of the loan the total numbers fall to ~55 million people or roughly 1/6 of the US population. The other mitigating factor is the patchwork of local and state eviction moratoriums in many of the large cities and populous costal states, which account for roughly 2/3rds of the population. This result is better but still grim, between 15-20 million up for eviction, concentrated in areas without eviction moratoriums where the eviction rate will be roughly 1 in 6. Many forced from their homes will never make a significant contribution to the economy ever again, those that do it will be years before they get back on their feet.

Another metric to look at is the value of the housing that the tens of billions in missed rent/mortgage payments represent. Doing quick and dirty math of 300k median housing price times 17 million households gives the astonishing $5.1 trillion in toxic residential assets. Using 2/3rds to account for the lower per unit cost of apartments and condos that's still $3.5 trillion and who knows what multiple of that number is tied up in MBSs and derivatives dependent on those loans. This also doesn't account for the lost value as millions of vacant houses and apartments start flooding every market without an eviction moratorium. 

note: I'm not expecting a new Stimulus bill before the 116th congress adjourns, so I'm not considering its effects. Both sides keep drawing lines in the sand the other wont cross, and have been for 7 months. Or put another way, we ain't getting shit with DOW@30k. Even if the eviction moratorium gets extended all we're doing is driving further up the mountain before driving off the cliff. 

TL;DR: Tens of Billions of missed payments, trillions in toxic assets, millions becoming homeless starting Jan 1, millions of evections starting Jan 1, a flood of vacant units destroying rental and property prices, cats and dogs living together, it's September 1929, only all the speakeasies are closed. 

Oh yeah, I haven't even considered commercial properties.

Edit: My "conclusions" in the TLDR were intended to be tongue in cheek, I just found these numbers to be far worse than I had anticipated and thought they should be shared._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $200k loss porn on GME ER.

That line was crossed yesterday. 

Started the year with $157K, deposited another $25K along the way, and now stand at $1.1MM. Expect IPOB (Opendoor) to be in the $35-$40 range and OAC (For Hims) to be in the $20s+ - do your own due diligence, this could certainly blow up on me and go the other way. But I love SPACs.
