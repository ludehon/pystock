CyberSecurity expert here _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Two of the largest areas of growth for Palantir are among the least discussed. 1. FASA

US Fourth Circuit:
‚ÄúThis appeal is centered on the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (‚ÄúFASA‚Äù), which requires that federal agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, procure commercially available technology to meet their needs.... On this record, we agree with the trial court that the Army failed in its obligation under ¬ß 2377 to determine whether a commercial item could meet or be modified to meet the Army‚Äôs procurement requirements.‚Äù

http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Palantir_17-1465.Opinion.9-13-18.pdf

This was the first time litigation was brought under FASA. Palantir won at trial and appeal. The DOD did not further appeal to SCOTUS and it is thus settled law that *all* governmental agencies (IC, DOD, HHS, DOJ... down to the Department of the Interior if needed) MUST use private contractors (as outlined by FASA) rather than develop technology in-house. 

Expect many new contracts for Palantir. Also expect them to continue to generate increased revenue (Project Apollo on top of PG‚ÄîProject Gotham) per contract. 

2. Project Maven

An executive at the deeply controversial and highly problematic artificial intelligence company Palantir has told company employees the work they‚Äôre doing is ‚Äúthis generation‚Äôs Manhattan Project.‚Äù 

https://www.inputmag.com/tech/palantir-exec-says-its-work-is-on-par-with-the-manhattan-project

This could form the basis of ALL military and IC AI for decades. The DoD budget is close to a a trillion dollars a year (3.2% of GDP) and growing. Yes having AirBus and JPM on board is a nice story to tell but really just superfluous given that the DOD (1) must use commercially available software if available and (2) Palantir along with Splunk (SPLK... much overlooked) is in a very small group of companies that can provide much needed next generation AI.

The same problem is happening now, people invest in actually profitable companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla but more and more people are getting anxious about missing out (PLTR cough cough) that they invest into any FinTech, EV, and Digital company just because the CEO said they will grow. Keep in mind that NIO is more overvalued than TSLA and yet TSLA still has bigger potential than NIO, just like Apple is adopting USB Type-C, so can Tesla adopt replaceable batteries if they're proven successful by NIO except the market will already be made ready for it by NIO.

Started learning options a couple months ago as well. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME DD Because there wasn't enough of it already I've been seeing a lot of comparisons between GME now and the VW short squeeze back in 2008. For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float.

https://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91

This is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float. The greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.

&#x200B;

The short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down.

https://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231

A GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die.

&#x200B;

I  think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us

&#x200B;

Edit: As some have also suggested, Ryan Cohen has suggested that he is frustrated with GME's Board of Directors. Cohen got around 600 million for his CHWY stake, and clearly is looking to reinvest. He's got 100 million (currently) in GME and if he so wished, he could buy more stock, seeking to kick out some of the board. This would also trigger the squeeze.

1. Three years to comply (NIO will NOT be AFFECTED, see link in EDIT (they are already compliant). 

2. These companies are already audited by American Big 4 firms in their local Chinese counterparts, for example NIO is audited by PWC China, just like a Canadian company is audited by PWC Canada and so on.

3. It's a huge investment market for American fund managers and investment banks as "More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion." This is not something institutions want to see vaporize as China is a massive market for unique investment opportunities and with a rising middle class will continue to grow.

4. These companies would need to simply switch some standards from IFRS which is used outside of the United States to the U.S GAAP accounting method, and allow for audits in their financial statements based on U.S GAAP. This procedure would incur higher cost for these firms, but given three years it is relatively simple to do.

5. Pressure from China, or other people within Biden's new cabinet and the new adminstration in general may overturn this rule. (However this is doubtful). But this may force China to negotiate a deal between the countries regarding these requirements and extending the timeline and softening the rules.

6. This is not something you need to worry about right NOW. Wait for the bill to be passed, see what the response from the companies CEO is and the path to allow for this switch to the U.S system, they have 3 years after all.

EDIT: Provided an additional link on NIO displaying that NIO is included in the PCAOB and will not need to worry about this law as they are already compliant. https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Chinese%20Companies%20on%20U.S.%20Stock%20Exchanges.pdf_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR GO BOOM BOOM TO THE MOON _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I made a list of 39 Electric Vehicle connected stocks - updating live.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pltr _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR short-term/ long-term prediction Hello, fellow autists.

I extend my deepest condolences to those who have fallen on PLTR FD 11/27.

I also want to congratulate those who have gained significantly from holding PLTR.

Personally, I Sold PLTR 19C 1/2021 for about 400% gain on Wednesday.

Friday's price action made me super nervous even though I didn't have a position.

I have followed Shitron for over a year and can say they are known for pumping or dumping hot stonks WITH PLANS TO CLOSING their positions for gains within 3 TRADING DAYS.

With this being said, there might be more downside on Monday and Tuesday. But by Tuesday, It will be safe to load up on PLTR again.

Look at what happened to BLNK, NIO, NVDA, TSLA.

Shitron does not provide extensive DD to justify their price target. They simply do it because stonks run too hot or cold in which they can manipulate the sentiment drastically.

It is possible Shitron covered some or all of their short position. It is also possible that they still have short position and plan on closing it on Monday or Tuesday by latest.

About 30 minutes before Shitron's tweet came out, PLTR started to lose steam and drop in value (This was them adding short position).

When they tweeted and caused fear in the market, many paper hands and profit takers rushed to sell.

We also witnessed how quick the dip was bought from -10% to -1% then back to -5% to end the day.

My prediction:

Monday will be volatile as usual. There is still great fear with PLTR caused by Shitron on Friday. If Shitron may drive the price down another 10. BUT if MONDAY is green, that just concludes Shitron already covered their short position.

My move:

If Monday is green, I will add PLTR to my position as Shitron has already closed their short position.

If Monday is red, I will wait for a good DIP entry possibly 5-15% red depending on the volume and speed of the dip.

My 2cents:

I get that this is WSB and people love to buy FDs. From time to time, I YOLO FD to feel that adrenaline rush and become a crackhead in going through the sub every second and researching every bit of info about my position.

But this can wipe you out. Yes, I've been there and you've been there.

I never want to be wiped out ever again.

Buy at least 1 month out with 0.2-0.3 delta option during PLTR dip opportunity and be patient.

May the TENDIES RAIN on US.

And lastly, F\*\*\* SHITRON!!!

Investors:

I'm not just one retard trying to sell this company to other retards. Big name investors see their potential too.

\_\_\_

Finances:

This is the ugly side of things. This company is not YET profitable, and probably wont be for a while. 3D printers are expensive. HOWEVER, as stated, big name investors are putting money into them to keep them alive and growing.

While they're not profitable, they have cash and utilize financial instruments to their advantage.

They have used direct offerings to steadily give investors opportunities to support their business and eat up more shares of their company. The last direct offering dropped the stock's price down significantly which is understandable because they offered the shares at $4. However, it did not take long for the stock's price to sky rocket shortly after big name investors bought up those shares. This is predicted to happen again. It has plenty of room to run until then. and if you're following the ticker, you'll be able to capitalize on the next direct offering and grab shares at a huge discount.

The price usually goes up after a direct offering.

Nano Dimensions isn't profitable but have plenty of investors who believe in them to support them until they are.

Is this a big no no or is there a big chance it will rise?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to ride momentum/meme stocks like PLTR/NIO/CRSR (and soon GME) without getting burned. Quick disclaimer, this isn't the only way, and it doesn't work if you buy at the top (obviously).  But I believe this is one of the better methods for maximizing returns while ensuring you don't get screwed when the train stops and the stock dumps 25% in a day.

Essentially what you do, is you buy a few slightly OTM calls dated at least 3-4 weeks out on a stock in meme status.  Sit on them until they go ITM and the value goes up substantially and then sell it, converting it into two new OTM calls for a similar distance out. The other important aspect is that there is leftover money after purchasing the two replacement calls.

&#x200B;

Example, in CRSR I bought a feb call for 4, sold it for 17 and bought two new feb calls for 5 each.  This way, I was able to increase my call position, while recovering my initial investment and locking in 300 dollars in profit. I did this 3 times while it moved from 23 to 53.  Now, I have a much larger position in CRSR than I started with in terms of money/calls, but even if those become worthless, I still made a lot of money on the stock (this was all with slightly otm stocks, but further otm would work as well).  It removes the need to time the top and bottom etc.  As long as you get in early enough to do one flip, you make a profit

&#x200B;

Again, this won't work as well for normal stock movements, but for these massive meme stocks it is a killer strategy.  It is especially important for GME, where it is poised to have the largest short squeeze in history with 125% of float shorted during a time where fomo is probably as high as any time in history.  We could squeeze to 40, or 400....no one really has any clue.  Once the squeeze ends, I would assume the stock price will dump back into the 30s.  Having a way to avoid having to sell at that point is important, and averaging out as it goes up runs the risk of missing out on massive profits. If someone else has a better strat, I'd love to hear it!

For those asking - current positions (not showing my 1500 shares) and a brief explanation of my short term plan IF GME doesn't start squeezing before ER.

So much more!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR tendies pre citron c block _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Revolve-the eCommerce retailer every teenage girl love whusupp fags, hope everyone enjoys thanksgiving with the family while looking at RH app all day waiting for Monday to arrive. Well, I'm here to show you a great opportunity to hopefully make some tendies.

Revolve is an e-commerce company selling clothes mainly for Millenials and gen-z founded 17 years ago. Revolve works through 2 segments, Revolve and Forward. Revolve sells more premium apparel, footwear, accessories, and beauty products (the average price of clothing is around 100$), FORWARD offers a variety of products from emerging and established luxury brands ( a few thousand dollars for a GUCCI dress).

Revolve is the main moneymaker that uses Instagram/TikTok models, celebrities, and influencers, and big events (like the revolve festival which they produce every year, Coachella which is the biggest festival in America and more) to market their products. As for 2019 marketing expenses were 14% of revenues or 27% of gross profit for the purpose of growing their young customer and retaining them until they will have a name for themselves. They also use algorithms and data that they collected for 17 years to better target, analyze and manage their ads and products. The 17 years of data is quite a lot if you compare it to other e-commerce retailers who are mainly small players who don't have a lot of data or big players that aren't in the e-commerce space or new to it.

The company has its own warehouse facility and are able to deliver their orders on the same day! this is a huge advantage against small competitors and can be leveraged to retain customers.

in 2018 the company started to expand to the UK, EU, Australia, Asia and Canada. They are expecting to open up also for New Zealand. International sales grew for the 3Q by more than 18% YOY and expected to continue the trend.

Now let's talk numbers:

Since 2016-2019 **revenues** almost doubled, for 2020 revenue I haven't seen guidance from the company but so far recorded revenues of 439.89 million meaning that to show growth this year they will have to record 161 million in revenue which is very likely especially if we will see fewer restrictions. The reason that growth will be very small is that Covid affected social interaction and gathering, which is the main reason people buy clothes, but covid hasn't destroyed their earnings like other retailers because Revolve is only an e-commerce retailer without any physical stores.

**Gross Margin improved to 55.3%** YOY which is great and the main reason for that is that they operate only online.

**Active customers** improved 5% although there were no big events which are the bread and butter of the company, showing a very good resilience for black swans like covid. 

**International Sales** grew 18% and represent 20% of net sales for the 3Q which is awesome considering they opened to these markets only 2 years ago.

**Revolve segment Net sales** declined only 4% YOY while Forward grew 9%.

**The company has 159$ cash on the balance sheet** (6 dollars a share) and 0 debt.

**Free Cash Flow** YTD is 74M which is more than double the FCF for 2019 and we still have a quarter to go.

The company is reducing expenses while keeping the same level of sales, for me it's impressive.

**Average order value** was 232$, an increase from 204$ prior Q but still low compared to 3Q YOY mainly because the customers shift to "at home" products like beauty and loungewear which are cheaper than dresses and "going out" clothes 

To make a long story short, Revolve is a great company that covid couldn't hurt as nearly as it hurt other retailers. It still has plenty of room to grow and when vaccines will be available this baby will rocket.

Bestbuy sells the same stuff, has more supply, and the best part is they know how to play the Wall Street game.

What game is that, you ask?
Here‚Äôs a little education for some of you. Ever see companies kill it on earnings and the stonk gets crushed? Lots at play here but one is whisper numbers, the other is guidance. 
Now you may have heard about ‚Äúkitchen sinking‚Äù the quarter or ‚Äúchannel stuffing‚Äù to make their numbers. 

But you know what bby did? They killed it on digital. The store is now just a pickup warehouse for delivery drivers to bring shit to your house. And they‚Äôre selling 30%+ more than per-pandemic 

But instead of telling you how amazing it is, management gave ZERO guidance. Stock got crushed because people hate uncertainty.

Electronics retail is the number ONE card spend category this year according to chase. (Discount warehouse (cost/bj) #2) And it wasn‚Äôt just when the pandemic started, it keeps getting better.

How many electronic retailers do you know? Online is a complete seperate category according to VISA merchant codes. That means you can say that BBY controls the TAM, market share for the card spend category. Which means it‚Äôs easy to see how things are going.

The January Effect is a perceived seasonal increase in stock prices during the month of January. Analysts generally attribute this rally to an increase in buying, which follows the drop in price that typically happens in December when investors, engaging in tax-loss harvesting to offset realized capital gains, prompt a sell-off. Another possible explanation is that investors use year-end cash bonuses to purchase investments the following month._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What Volkswagen short squeeze teaches us Ok autists, long before we started trading, Porshe made the greatest squeeze of all time.

Porshe happened. One day they said: "we bought 42.2% of the shares and we have 30% of shares controlled by us through options, representing a total amount of 74%".

250 shares @ 24, 110 shares @ 31_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR found on Bloomberg‚Äôs Businessweek, surely I most be doing something good, right? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB Autist Game Plan Week of November 30 (All-in-One Thread) Yoo! I've been browsing these autistic forums and all I see is multi-threads asking the same questions, asking about the same stocks, asking about the next big Yolo.

Here is everything summed up:

\*\*\* Edit \*\*\*

 This week there is a vote on legalizing MaryJ and there are plenty of stocks to choose from:

ACB - we all know the bread and butter of this one.

CGC - expensive out of all of them.

KERN - 

But the one I have my eyes on because its fairly cheap and has an announcement on December second i trading under $1. I think there is a merger that is going to be announced soon. I plan on loading up on BOTH shares and CALLS 1/2$ strike for 2021. I feel that out of all Cannabis stocks this one has the best risk vs reward. Couldnt list the name here bc it is considered a banned ticket, probably because its a penny stock. Do your own DD.

\*\*\*\*\*

PLTR - clearly is this is the TSLA of AI/Data. We will most likely see a small pullback in the coming days as more autists lock in their gains, but this is an opportunity to buy shares at a discount and some cheaper calls far out into 2021 (35C + or higher). You can go ahead and buy some next week.

GME - If you look at GME's performance over last 20 years it has its best/high stock value at console release time. This year wont be any different and the tradition will continue. There is a lot of news about the activist investor / ex Chegg dude trying to restructure the company, huge short interest, cash on hand and early debt redemption. Expect GME to Sky rocket past 20$ before Christmas. TLDR: I bought 75 Jan 20C, will add more next week further out into March+.

SWIR - Sierra Wireless. Definitely a sleeper stock, but recent financial earnings/report have been good. Stock is current trading at a discount and options March and later are pretty cheap. I have 100x March 20C. I expect this one to creep slowly til then and surprise us again in February with Q4 earnings.

TSLA - Papa Musk is Jesus is human form. We should give thanks and praise for all the tendies he has rained unto this world. Until then, stay cautious, tesla is up 50% in like 2 weeks, it will most likely continue its climb up, but right now isnt the time to buy options, wait for a pullback b/c they are too expensive.

MP - plenty of posts about rare earth elements. This is a long term play, I dont expect it to rally as hard as PLTR but its a good side stock to own, potential have some contracts, but they are pricey. I would wait for a retracement first.

CRSR - the make quality gaming accessories. If you missed the run from 15$ to 50$, fear no more, this pullback is a blessing in disguise. I am targetting a pullback to 30$ before loading up on shares and far dated calls. This should be trading and eventually catchup to LOGI.

Feel free to add other ideas. These are my current plays.

What were paying for the current premiums, it wouldn't be a blip on finances to just grab a couple shares and forget about it. These shares are not being bought to make a quick buck, that's what options are for, were buying and holding out of pure spite. 1.6 million strong everyone buys a couple shares to hold and moves on.

Or should I throw it all at PLTR and pray?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IPOB (Opendoor) - Merger Vote Announced for 12/17; Momentum Starting to Build. $350K YOLO. [As folks may remember from my prior post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jyh6zs/ipob_opendoor_nameplate_institutions_piling_in/) IPOB has seen heavy institutional buying from credible funds including Ark (their next generation and fintech ETFs), Soros, Sulvretta, Fidelity, and others. The stock has continued to rally since then, increasing from the $18 range now to $22 as of Friday. Institutions now own greater than 50% of the float, and the key names above at least 25%. Rare for a pre-merger SPAC.

Since then, substantial bullish option sweeps have come into play, now at least 6MM+ shares spoken for with OTM calls ranging from $20-$35 strikes. These are big bets not driven by retail as the buys have been in big increments in the last handful of days. Put mine on the table a few weeks ago. This heavy call volume sets the stage for a gamma squeeze on top of the 4MM shares short. With 40MM in the float and more than half spoken for by institutions, not a lot left for cover.

The recent move has been driven by IPOB announcing its merger vote date in its latest S-4 filing for December 17th, setting the stage for an end of year rally. The thesis is that upon combination, mutual funds will follow Cathie Woods, Fidelity, and other names as IPOB will then be Opendoor (many funds can't buy pre-combination as they are not actually investing in a company ... yet). The upward price momentum is driven by where the implied valuation is now compared to the comp universe, and it has a long way to go.

Zillow, Redfin, and Carvana all trade for 6-7x forward 2021 revenues. IPOB trades at an implied 3x 2021 revenues of $3.5B. This implies a current upside of about 2x from current levels (from $22 a share to $40 a share) if it trades just in line with these comps.

Arguably, it should trade higher as the market share leader with a lot more growth potential than any of these, together with the pedigree of the team, technology, and market position. Someone may argue it is lower margin (true), though that is offset by the market size. Also, Carvana's margins are also low and in an even more competitive market with less differentiation.

As shown with Snowflake, he's not afraid of moving with the times. Let's discuss some possibilities.

The biggest ones I saw mentioned were TSLA and PLTR with some going as far as saying PSTH. Obviously we'd all like for it to be one we're holding so we're biased.

I don't think TSLA is it, he had so much time to buy and now he'd be buying at the very top.

PSTH is possible if he knows the target and that target is indeed Stripe. 

Of the 3, PLTR seems the most likely.

The SPAC name is PIC and the merger will happen in December. XL Fleet already has revenue and established clients, unlike other meme EV companies with no factories, products or revenue.

However, I have found the best part for you. If big words scare you here's how I would explain to a 3 year old : "Existing clients trust XL. XL making end to end EV solution. Existing client want full solution."

Or go through this:

"In the future, XL intends to leverage its strong OEM and upfitter partnerships, internal engineering expertise and broad customer base to bring new electrification solutions to market. These include a wider array of available chassis options, deeper relationships with current and future OEM partners, and an expansion of XL‚Äôs electrification suite to include EV and potentially hydrogen fuel cell enabled systems. XL expects to develop proof-of-concept prototypes of these new systems in 2021 and introduce such systems for sale between late 2021 and late 2022.
XL plans to offer charging and power management solutions. Such solutions are expected to include charging stations, onsite energy storage and power generation as well as system management. This offering will be branded as XL GRID, and XL expects to work with a range of partners to provide a consolidated and comprehensive offering. XL anticipates that it will formally launch XL GRID as an offering available for sale by the end of 2020.
Further, XL has a unique opportunity to leverage its hardware, software and energy industry partnerships to potentially launch an Electrification as a Service (‚ÄúEaaS‚Äù) offering. Such an offering bundles vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicle (‚ÄúxEV‚Äù) powertrains, charging infrastructure, power and energy supply and other services for customers to provide an easy and low risk transition to fleet electrification and emissions reductions. Such an offering has the potential to increase product sales for XL and leverages the data in XL Link. XL expects that this offering will also create pools of fleet electrification assets which are attractive to infrastructure and other investors, especially those with sustainability targets and focus. XL anticipates to offer EaaS to select customers beginning in 2021."

I saw the beginning of 3rd party delivery systems when Grubhub began to force themselves into the industry. This pissed a lot of people off at first because the menus that they posted on their website was not always accurate. They were also representing restaurants through their service and this was a dick move. 
At first, I was annoyed by Grubhub because it was inconvenient. Orders would come in through fax machines. Sometimes orders would not come in and customers would get pissed. But eventually they started calling us to let us know a fax was sent which solved that problem. 
Eventually I began to see the potential in 3rd party delivery systems. Grubhub began to give us a lot of business.
A few years later we started seeing Postmates and then Doordash. That‚Äôs when the tablets came in to the restaurants or when people would start showing up ordering for customers through their smartphones. 
This is when I really started to see the big growth potential. 
At this point, I was managing restaurants so for me it was important to get sales in because my bonuses depended on that. So we started signing up with any 3rd party system we could think off. We had multiple tablets going. 
In 2019 is when shit hit the fan. We were seeing all the millennials and gen Z ordering like never before. I even started to hear people say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs Doordash some food‚Äù in public. We were getting so much business through these 3rd party companies that we had to turn off our tablets to stop orders from coming in.
The busiest companies were Doordash and Uber Eats. Postmates never became big in the 10 years I was in the industry. Grubhub began to decline over the years and eventually it became so small that I didn‚Äôt even get many order from them. 
Now we have Doordash and Uber eats. Out of those 2 companies Doordash has the better customer support and more advantages. We would get bigger orders from Doordash because they‚Äôre office friendly. It‚Äôs so easy to add people to your order if you‚Äôre in an office setting or a large gathering. 
We also saw way more orders coming in from Doordash than Uber eats. I just looked up the market share and Doordash controls 50% or the delivery business which confirms my personal anecdotes.
Obviously, both companies struggle to show profits but that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre in growth mode. And Doordash numbers are significantly better than Uber. 
My money is on Doordash. I can see this company taking over this industry or at least being a significant competitor for Uber. 
Delivery has changed forever. It will be the common way to order in the future. This isn‚Äôt just a pandemic thing. This is what the industry has become over a period of 10 years. It is also a duopoly so there‚Äôs no way a restaurant would dare compete with them through their own delivery business. As the saying goes ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt beat them, join them‚Äù.

A dedicated shareholder._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I found this while Googling ‚ÄúMeme stock‚Äù. PLTR TO THE MOON MY FELLOW DEGENERATES üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Phases of WSB Meme Stocks Buy PLTR shares, hold for at least a month- this is ‚Äúphase 3‚Äù of WSB.  Rational people think it can‚Äôt double AGAIN, idiots don‚Äôt know when to stop making memes & pushing it with unconditional faith of it hitting 1,000% gains, and retards make the profits. 


See NIO- NIO‚Äôs ‚Äúphase 3‚Äù happened around the $26-$35 range.  Solid increase from there.  
See GME- their phase 3 happened around the $11 mark- now up to $16.  


Phase 1: WSB mentions a stock in DD and someone makes a meme about it, but 95% don‚Äôt have a clue about the company, but enjoy the hype. 


Phase 2: The stock makes more than 50% gains, and it officially becomes a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stock.  95% of people still don‚Äôt know much about it, but Google the ticker.  And watch a few memes. This is where normal people think that there will be a pullback from a 50-100% gain & don‚Äôt jump on board.  Retards jump all in and see another 50% gain.  


Phase 3:  contention.  At this point, the stock has at least doubled, probably tripled since its first meme.  There is some profit taking, maybe a pullback (10-25%) but the memes don‚Äôt stop.  It get good coverage, it gets bad coverage, but all attention is good.  Can last for 1 day to 2 weeks. Then resumes at least a 30% gain from its last high.  Real wall street is forced to enter real positions in it.  


Phase 4:  Latency. Big money bought in high, refuses to sell and be the bag holder, just waits for the next round of hype to take gains, or ride higher.  (NIO is here, GME is here with the short squeeze).

Citrons decision to issue a $20 target EOY makes sence because the lockup period ends, which means that early investors will then be free to release some of their stock that they got in a single digits and sell in a open market. If we talk about right now, the momentum is insane, which means there is still alot of space to grow until EOY, wouldn't even be suprised if we touch $50. If we talk about future years, PLTR will be huge, and even these 30, 40, 50 will look cheap AF. I just wanted to tell you that you should fucking wake up and realise how big this shit is and will be even bigger! If you are ready to let time do it's work just fucking buy these shares.

Gotham-
Transforms data to be user friendly. Software engineers and database developers know how to interpret and query the data in the corporation‚Äôs database. However, retards like you and business people need an easier way of understanding the mass amounts of data(pretty pictures). For example a company like Moderna or Pfizer could utilize it to find out the fine details and make connections about the vaccines they‚Äôre distributing. Gotham would provide pretty diagrams and charts to interpret how many people in certain age groups take the vaccine and the amount of side effects they may experience. Additionally the data from Moderna and Pfizer are separate. Since this is a pandemic, we may want them to collaborate and combine both their data. Gotham is the only easy tool out there that would allow these 2 corporations to do that seamlessly. These features are extremely attractive towards business people and corporations. It will essentially take away the need for business people having to ask the weaboo antisocial software engineers what the fuck they‚Äôre showing on their cum stained monitors.

*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday‚Äôs testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday‚Äôs close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April‚Äôs 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn‚Äôt abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ‚ÄúThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.‚Äù Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,‚Äù as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday‚Äôs November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed‚Äôs minutes, they‚Äôre in transition here. They‚Äôre becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,‚Äù said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. ‚ÄúThe employment data clearly has been weakening,‚Äù said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,‚Äù noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,‚Äù said Faranello. ‚ÄúThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?‚Äù
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. ‚ÄúThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.‚Äù The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe still see the Nasdaq leading,‚Äù said Krosby. ‚ÄúWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.‚Äù

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It‚Äôs the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market‚Äînear a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December‚Äôs ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000‚Äôs single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let‚Äôs be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‚Äò40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let‚Äôs be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.‚Äù

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn‚Äôt being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> Let‚Äôs be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ‚Äô21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn‚Äôt only about the US anymore.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.

> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful? Dow at 30,000!

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What I make at 3AM to help ease the pain of waiting til Monday _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BLNK takeover rumors Probably a bit late since this thing has already ran from $4 to $28.

Blink has a massive charging system through the US, and has a market advantage because of the fragmented nature of everyone else. Other than the  TSLA system, which is limited to the TSLA cult.

I want a seat on this rocketship motherfuckers. To the moon!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QuantumScape ($QS) EV growth potential with boomer backing QuantumScape is a US EV battery developer that just started trading on NYSE yesterday.

**Technology**

QuantumScape was founded in 2010 by Jagdeep Singh who is also the founder of Infinera which is anorther high tech start-up company.

They are developing solid-state lithium batteries relying on a solid material known as "solid-state electrolyte", whereas conventional batteries rely on liquid or gel electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes allow for a much higher energy density, resulting in a longer range and more importantly in faster-charge times of about 15 minutes.  Since 2010 they spent over 300 Million $ in the development of this technology.

Their battery technology promises:

* A range of over 300 miles
* Charging in under 15 minutes
* Costs per car under 30K$
* A Battery Lifetime of more than 12 years or over 150,000 miles
* More safety due to the non-oxidizable solid-state technology

The fact, that lithium-ion batteries didnt improve their engery density since 2015 is in my point of view the biggest plus. They secured their advancements with over 200 existing and pending patents.

**Financials**

Of course QuantumScape isnt profitable yet, and they dont plan to be cash flow positive until 2027.

They accumulated a deficit over the years of about 256 Million $ leading to a negative equity. But accumulated deficit/ accumulated profit is as all of us a know a pure accounting figure with no actual cash outflows. The massive pile of retained losses is due to their constant R&D spendings, hopefully resulting in true technological advancements.

QuantumScape has enough cash at hand to repay their non-current liabilites and 3 times the amount of their current liabilities. Additionally, no additional debt financing is planned as they expect to generate 1 billion $ through their NYSE listing through the SPAC Kensington Capital Aquisitions (230 million $ funding, management and board  stacked with  automotive and technology experts).

Based on a forward looking revenue growth modell (20% discount rate) QuantumScape is valued at 3,3 billion $, whilst the current market cap is around 560 milion

**Backing**

QuantomScope is backed by a lot of expierenced decision makers like JB Straubel from Tesla but also with a load of inovative investors. In 2020 the Volkswagen Group announced its plans to increase shareholding in QuantumScape. Volkswagen sees the future in solid-state batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries as they started cooperating with QuantumScape in 2012. QuantumScape and VW established a joint-venture together to equip all VW EVs. VW is currently producing around 11 million cars per year and has plans to launch 70 electric vehicle models by 2029 with an additional spending of 38 billion $ in eletric mobility by 2024.

Additional investors are Continental, Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy which is a umbrella for several organizations that are bundling efforts to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy. Members are Jeff Bezoss, Jack Ma, Richard Branson and George Soros among others.

QuantumScope started trading on friday with a gain of roughly 60%. It is expected that many investors are jumping on the boat till the end of the year.

My beloved autists, I am suggesting an alternative way to make money out of the legalization's rumor. Given the fact that many of us already burned ourselves with weed stonks, I am not suggesting buying a single stonk option, instead buy the f&@king industry, **$MJ.**  

Almost every single sign is looking bullish on the daily chart. For example, we had: *high volume* breakout, *backtest*, *higher highs-lows*, strong momentum, and we closed on the high on Friday (big green dildo candle). The only risk we have is an unfilled gap between 14.03 and 13.60 and an overbought RSI, which represents some downside risk, but we all know these weed stonks, they don't give a f&@k about RSI. Even if we fill that gap, I will just use the opportunity to buy more calls.

You might wonder, what about the mid and long-term...  Well, I can tell you that the weekly chart is even more bullish. *RSI* still has plenty of room to go and it's *rising* steadily. MACD just broke resistance, *momentum* is extremely strong. If we can get above 15.37 on Monday, we will literally go to the freaking **Moon**! My price target is between 22.82-24.10 (**52% upside potential**). *IV* is still *low*, compared to the last 2 week's high.

Since there's a lot of newer ~~gamblers~~ investors on WSB, there's been a lot of anger directed at Citron research for a tweet that probably cost 90% of WSB their portfolio cause they bought 11/27 PLTR calls. An expensive lesson in buying 0/1/2 DTE options.

There was a post that was, well...a "cope" post which was painting Citron as essentially always being wrong. "What about NIO!!" - yes, they got that wrong. But there's multiple stocks they've covered that dropped 90%+, including a Pharmaceutical GIANT (Valeant Pharma). They're right a lot more than they are wrong. Do your own DD [here](https://citronresearch.com/category/citron_reports/page/2/) (archive of the reports they've posted). I looked through some of their bearish calls, and here's a small list.

PLTR may well recover and go to 50+, or it may continue to drop to $20. The point of this post is to provide the other side of the coin - Citron gets it right a lot. Do they get some wrong too? Sure, but for the newer 'investors' that haven't been in the game for a long time, there's a reason a simple tweet from Citron can cause a stock to go from +26% to -4% in a shortened trading day.

SaaS company that does work for Papa Elon, Uber, SpaceX...

Same market cap as PLTR but tiny tiny volume, yet nobody has taken advantage!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upwork ($UPWK) is going to the moon. Upwork is the incumbent internet marketplace for freelance talent. I started buying their stock 18 months ago after a great experience hiring a freelancer on their platform. 

**Here are the macro trends driving this company forward:**

 + Worldwide English Language Learning
 + Worldwide Broadband Installation
 + Constantly improving SaaS tools ( = non stop improvement of remote work)
 + Boomers (morons who demand commutes to an office) retiring.
 + GenX and Millennials replacing Boomers, pushing remote work for a variety of reasons.
 + An ongoing global emergency pushing cost cutting and org change

**They've had a few specific recent catalysts:**

- CEO change from non-innovator (Stephane Kasriel) to innovator (Hayden Brown)
- Recently released a clone of the 2nd place competitor (Fiverr)'s structured marketplace
- Are still valued at less than 8x trailing 12 month sales (compare to a tech company like Okta at 21x)
- Management messaging shift to the mega grand slam upside - Upwork's mission is to "put freelance talent at the heart of every business in the world." 

That is actually attainable and I believe the market is in the process of changing their valuation from that of a staffing agency (think Robert Half) to that of a leading SaaS incumbent (think Shopify.)

Macro trends alone will take Upwork past a $30B market cap (6x). The right software innovation takes way past this base scenario to $100B or even more (20x+). That's how big this opportunity is. They have a massive head start and have reclaimed the innovator position.

I read the above article and learned that AvePoint belongs to an elite group of stocks that meet the following conditions:

Revenue: $150 million+

Year-over-year growth: 25%+

EBIT margins: 10%+

I did some quick back-of-the-envelope analysis to see how much room we have to run. I came to the conclusion that we have at least 100% upside remaining by the end of 2020.

Analysis: https://imgur.com/qB2n3Kq

In addition to being undervalued per forward P/S ratio, AvePoint also has a very strong balance sheet.

This is easily the most fundamentally sound SPAC play in recent history. This has been an interesting surprise given the fact that the SPAC market has been flooded with pre-revenue companies selling fantasies. This is still being slept on the way PLTR was after listing when it hovered below $10/share. The SaaS/Cloud factor will obviously deliver hype as will comparisons to PLTR and SNOW. AND the best part is the math actually checks out with one. Literally free money.

Dropped 6 figures in today at $15. Won't sell a share until $30. Easy double. Gonna buy a new TSLA Model S with my gains on this one.

PLTR AND AvePoint are the truth.

This community makes my day everyday from 3 years and you don't know how much that means to me. I'm sure it's the same for a lot of you, but personally you helped me massively get through depression, believe me.

I say "remember these days" because there is no guarantee that they'll last forever, and every day could be closer to the end. 

Looking back we'll se how crazy this year was for wsb. The level at which we are pumping worthless meme stocks everyday and riding them to absurd prices is just beyond imaginable, and it's too goddamn fun gambling away savings with you on FDs. 

We really did make trading mainstream this year, since everyone and their mom is talking about it. And we arguably changed the market, because for better or for worse, every relevant player in the industry at least knows of our existence and has accepted the presence of this new entity that behaves radically differently. 

Some might say wsb is just the product of last stage bull market euphoria, and deep down it just is, because unlike the retards at r/stocks at least half of us knows deep down the lie at the heart of it all.
But even if this dot com bubble level retard strenght fades, what matter is who wins out of this speculation. And the real victory will come only if we see boomers from r/investing and institutional investors baghold the stocks that we millennials and zoomers rode to the fucking moon. That must be our objective. 

So treasure these days, because the wsb phenomenon is trurly making history in the finance world, and we don't know how many days we have left before there's nobody left to bid stonks higher.

Its gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted. How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%).

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)

So if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?

**Consoles**

Well, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.

**Cohen**

Also, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon.

&#x200B;

[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positioning**

They have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer.

**The move:**

Buy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.

Important note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**

edit\* positions are long 1,000 shares and more when I get my next paycheck. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $STMP Stamps.com is on a Pull Back & Will no Doubt Benefit from Record Online Sales Amid the COVID Holiday Season Findings:

$STMP will likely benefit from a record breaking online shopping season as a result of COVID related shut downs and stay at home orders. As a bonus COVID has forever changed the nature of online retail. All businesses large and small want online exposure. This will ensure $STMP stays in demand well after COVID has passed.

$STMP is currently oversold after a bout of profit taking after earnings which is not uncommon for the security if you check the chart. $STMP is currently hanging over hard $175 resistance. $STMP saw some positive price action Friday as a result of the implications of record online holiday sales. 

$STMP smashed earnings each quarter for more than a year, and guided up for the upcoming quarter. Quarterly revenue growth YoY is 42.40%. Quarterly earnings growth YoY is 599.30% 

3.79% of $STMP is held by insiders and 90.7% of $STMP is held by institutions. 83 institutions have increased their position in $STMP, 101 institutions have started a position in $STMP, and $81 institutions have decreased their positions in $STMP. STMP has a relatively small 17.57 M float

$STMP market cap is $3.31 billion with a price to book ratio of 3.64 and a P/E of 22.52. EPS is 8.07. 

Analyst price targets range from $280 on the low end to $406 on the high end. Current short volume, (not short interest) is 43.65%. 

$STMP options are priced for wild swings making it difficult to profit off of naked calls alone. As a result covered calls may be preferred. After purchasing 100 shares selling a call is likely a safe bet. If the option expires above the break even price you‚Äôll profit by selling the shares for the price you want and collect the premium. If the option expires between the strike and the break even you‚Äôll keep the shares and collect the premium. If the price goes down your shares may lose value but you‚Äôll also get to collect the premium and perhaps be primed for the swing. $STMP would need to drop significantly amid historic online sales for the covered call strategy to become unprofitable. 

Yet another strategy is to sell a put. If you want some $STMP shares but disappointed you missed the bounce off of resistance at $175 you can sell a put. If the option expires above the break even price you‚Äôll get to collect the premium. If it dips below the break even price you‚Äôll get 100 shares for the price you want. 

It is a long way away from next earnings report in February but $STMP share price will likely benefit from a record online holiday shopping season. As a result institutions will want to be primed before February ER. This generally means at some point they will be tripping over each other in an effort to accumulate and maximize a profitable position before their competition does. In short, I don‚Äôt know when this pump will happen but the earlier you get in the better. Past earnings demonstrate a 15-35 day lull before $STMP starts to pump again. 

I am long STMP with 50 shares @ $178 and recently profited from a $175 put I sold that expired worthless last Friday.

Background:


STMP essentially turns small to large businesses, offices, and warehouse shippers into mini Amazons by facilitating discounted print and drop off from location shipping. As a number of businesses are moving to online retail amid the pandemic the ability to pay for and print postage from the work place to be picked up by USPS or UPS is convenient and essential. https://www.stamps.com . 

Here are a list of their partners
https://www.stamps.com/company-info/partners/

And they offer a unique line of products for small offices, online sellers, warehouse shippers, corporate postage solutions, photo stamps etc.

$STMP is currently working on expanding their business to foreign markets, and if successful, will have tremendous upside potential!

More importantly, amid all this market pumping $STMP is on a pullback primed for a lot of upside until next earnings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let me try again. Sorry for my atist ass.

Hello fellow Redditors,

I have been trading with RobinHood for about a year now, and have seen some pretty great results. I have made about $1800 in profit over the last year, which is not bad considering I started with only $120. That being said, I have always invested in stocks that I researched on my own; I never really followed any of the "hype" on Reddit when buying stocks. Anyway, lately I've been seeing numerous posts concerning $PLTR and how people are hoping they reach $40 by this Monday. I did some research on the company and to be frank, I have no idea if I should invest in it or not. I mean, if the stock hits $40+, that would be great but how likely is that (I am genuinely wondering if it is expected to hit $40)? Should I follow the hype and invest the $1920 in my account in $PLTR? Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Gather round little autists and let me tell you a tale about December 2018.....

&#x200B;

'Twas the month before Christmas, and all through the street

Not an asset was lagging, not even the REITs;

Valuations were propped on mostly thin air,

In hopes that St. earnings soon would be there;

The autists were feeling all smug from the feds;

While visions of yacht slats danced in their heads;

The threads filled with jokes about Bernie the felon,

The reserve was kept honest by sweet mama Yellen,

The managers were loaded with no place to park it,

Tarts on the squawk chirped *you don't fight the market*,

When out of the blue came a shock to the DOW,

Word spread the Canades had nabbed Meng Wanzhou.

Away to the screens I flew like a flash,

Could it be that fat thumbs caused an erroneous crash?

We'd staved off the threat of the brown caravan,

Could this be a ploy by the grave Tariff Man?

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

The FANGS were all sinking as greed bowed to fear,

With put prices jumping and margin so thick,

No one had a moment to yolo the VIX.

More rapid than eagles the doubters they came,

Bears he whistled, and shouted, and cheered with no shame:

The blue chips to small caps were all made to bleed

Not a sector found safety, not even weed

Just when they thought things were turning around,

On to the talk shows Buffet came with a bound.

To each money honey he repeated his tip,

Calm yourselves maggots - invest in this dip!

A bundle of pundits all jumped on his back,

The hedgies and quantboys each clung to his sack.

His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!

His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And still each new session hit fresh yearly lows;

Mods spoke not a word, but went straight to their work,

They flaired all the loss porn and banned all the jerks,

And laying a finger aside of their nose,

They snorted up Xanax like fresh fallen snow;

As fast as it started the bears blew the whistle,

Christmas eve saw the SPY shoot up like a missile.

But I heard bears exclaim, as they drove out of sight‚Äî

We need to liquidate these bears._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aurora Canabis is set for a huge run up around 12/15. I know, I know. Already up 276% since the month started.

So, Mexico is on the brink of legalization. 12/15 is a huge date.

&#x200B;

Mexican Senators approved a historic adult use cannabis legalization bill on Nov. 19, with an 82 to 18 vote. This doesn't legalize adult use just yet, but Mexico appears well on its way to becoming the third nation to do so and potentially the largest legal marijuana market in the world. The bill's passage comes after five similar Supreme Court rulings, which deemed prohibition unconstitutional. Two extended deadlines delayed the process, but everything appears to be on track as the bill heads to Congress' lower house for a final review and Senate vote.

Mexican President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador said a marijuana legalization bill that is advancing is ‚Äúpart of carrying out a revolution of consciences, where each of us is responsible for his actions.‚Äù The comments come as the Senate-passed legislation has been formally received by the Chamber of Deputies, where it has been referred to several committees.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for Aurora.

Aurora is the leading company with in roads already. Mexico is a much larger market then California, currently the largest market in the world, and California pulled in 3.1 BILLION from legal weed in 2019.

Now, Mexico doesn't have the best weed already. So good quality weed will change the market, but Mexico is poor. Remember the standard price for an 1/8th in the world is $50 USD, which is over 1000 pesos.  And the average salary in Mexico is just over 13000 pesos per month. So 1/13th of their salary for an 1/8th a month.

&#x200B;

I don't think Mexico alone is the reason to get behind Aurora. But they are in the best position of any company. 12/15 will decide if private companies OR major companies will get to sell. How it will look. Government controlled (Uruguay) or private (Canada).

&#x200B;

"Also, Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NYSE:ACB), the Canadian company defining the future of cannabinoids worldwide, announced on November 25 that it has entered into a strategic Supply Agreement with Cantek Holdings, one of Israel's leaders in the medical cannabis field. - "([https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/))

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, basically, Aurora has inroads in Canada, Israel, and is set up huge for Mexico. It's a long play, because eventually they will be set up nice when the US also goes legal.

However, right now, I think is the time for some calls set around December 18th. Stock will almost certainly hit $16 before 12/15, and if news looks good, it'll jump to $20. After January it'll drop to around $13 and slowly rise to $20 by next December. That's my opinion. Do as you will.

Update on this company by user in the comments:

"They do not deal with hydrogen battery. They are more like micro grid supplier that uses natural gas/ biogas and covert them to clean energy with hydrogen and water being a byproduct.

Now, How to fight the boomers and the MM?

1. Stop yoloing your entire bankroll into one position

2. Buy in portions (smaller % of your bankroll) during DIPs if you going to buy at the top I'd suggest buying at least 1-2months out of expiration and get ready to ride through the next DIP. (Also lower your strike and longer dates as you keep buying, don't keep buying the same strike/expiration)

3. Since you have been buying steadily at different levels, you can have set target for each buys depending on your risk tolerance, hence stagger your profit taking.

I'm not your financial advisor nor I am telling you to buy anything, but instead of yoloing everything with one bullet, reduce your risk and stay in the game for the long fight.

Here's the clip:  https://clips.twitch.tv/PeacefulSuccessfulFrogWTRuck_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How far OTM should I buy calls? How far out of the money do you retards buy your calls?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IVR maybe a good idea? Alright, for those that don't research I decided to actually see what a mReit really is and how it makes money. 

after sticking 10k into this I figured, what the hell might as well see what's up. 

mortgage reits make money on the difference of interest rates between banks and securities. With interest rates low, this gives them a larger profit margin. Unlike reits that buy, manage and control assets, mReits play off the debt and are actually considered financial investments. 

I could be wrong, if I am someone who isn't ignorant please correct me. The following is how it goes. 

E.g.

Consider a mReit a bank in this example. The mReit has enough money to leverage a loan and pay the monthly interest rate on the loan to keep it going. 

A buyer wishes to purchase a house. they get a 4% fixed interest rate. The "bank" loans them the money and they purchase the house. The bank, not really having the money leverages it's pool of money from "investors". Then uses that money as a "down payment" in a way to get a loan from the "Rothschilds"/fed/place giving out money to rich rich people/business. The Rothschilds offer a mReit the loan, but at a 2% interest rate. The difference being 2%. That 2% is profit for the mReit. While interest rates are low/cut. The mReit gains even more profit. As long as they can pay the monthly interest rate. 

being that covid-19 hit, people couldn't pay bills, which meant IVR had to pay off debts to afford the monthly interest rates. At the same time, the fed cut interest rates to 0%-0.25%. Anyone buying a house during this time will of course get a lower interest rate from the bank (3-4%), but IVR is essentially banking on the difference between the buyers loan and the feds loan. As employment goes back into full swing, fed interest rates will slowly go up, but when people start to pay their mortgage, IVR will be making more money than before until it sorta flat lines back to a standard difference like pre-covid.

If fed interest rates rise above the borrowed rates, IVR loses money on loans(this is where the risk is). If interest rates stay the same and people don't pay their bills, IVR has to use it's own capital to pay the monthly interest anyways. with no income, it drops fast(this is also the risk)

mReits typically are made up of investors and lots of cash. the more mortgages they can buy and "flip" the more money comes in to pay out to investor's. They typically pay out close to 90% of their profit in dividends to investor's and hold the 10% for operations/banking.


200 bill loaned from fed @ 1%.
They use the 200 bill + investor money to buy mortgages and loan house buyers the money @ 3%. 

for estimating purposes, say IVR has to pay that 1% every month. that equals two billion dollars in interest every month having to be paid out to the Fed or whoever. 

then they also received 3% from their mortgages they've lent out to home buyers. this equates to a monthly interest of 6 billion. 

this leaves 4 billion in profit. All but 400 mill is held for dividends. 

The 400 mill every month* is either used to leverage more debt, save for hard times, or pay down debts. 

they literally make money off borrowing money. I have a good feeling this will come back. of course it may take a while, but it all makes sense. if I am wrong on any of this, please tell me I'm ignorant and teach me.‚Äã_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Michael Burry Says HI YOU ALL!! &#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yes, **STANSBERRY RESEARCH.** The shitty company that bugs you with ads with messages from none other than Dr. Ron Paul about how the economy will collapse soon and that you should bury gold in your backyard.

Not only that, the only mentions they have made of shitcoin are in the last month or two, and they don't have any actual business with Shitcoin other than that the CEO made an investment in it.

* MSTR is up over 80% in the last month: it can't be a real investment at this point, it's ***JUST A CASINO.***

The company has **missed earnings the last three quarters**, and the one time in recent history that it had an earnings beat, the price plunged.

In Citron's report on MSTR, they speak positively of its CEO, Michael Saylor. The first thing it says about him is a 2 year late misattributed idea, [which actually originated from Marc Andreessen in 2011](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/):

This is possibly the lamest software company I've ever seen, but the real smoking gun is that Citron is endorsing it. I am a total retard: no doubt about it, but you must do your duty Monday and buy ~~PUTS~~ more shares of PLTR. The shitcoin PR stunt was the death knell of this sub-par company. I have seen toddlers finger-paint more innovative things than this.

Positions: **NONE** I'm too fucking poor to short this massive fraud, the premium on puts is astronomical. Selling calls looks like it would work, though.

~~Nevertheless, I intend to purchase one: MSTR $170P 7/2021 on Monday.~~  After looking at the bid-ask spread on this there's no way I can buy a put. Hopefully it changes, alternatively just buy any stock that Citron goes short on.

Other positions:

* 300 shares PLTR
* PLTR $44C 12/4
* PLTR $28C 12/18
* PLTR $30C 1/2023

Citron Research is the biggest short of all time. Does anyone know if they have a ticker?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short squeeze explained for room-temperature IQ Before getting to short squeeze consider this scenario:

Assume you have a long position in Amazon: meaning that you're holding AMZN shares hoping the price will increase in the future and you can make a profit by selling the share. Let's say you bought at $3000 and are hoping to sell at $4000. One morning you wake up and open your Robinhood, and to your dismay, the price of AMZN has fallen to $2000. You freak out and decide to sell quickly to minimize your losses. The highest bid you find is $1998 and you sell at that price. You decreased the price by 2 extra dollars. So by increasing the supply of AMZN, you (and millions of other scared AMZN holders) add to the momentum of the price falling.

A short squeeze is kinda similar but in the opposite direction:

First, let's see how a short position works. You short a stock when you expect its price to fall and you want to profit from the decline. Assume the current price of AAPL is $120 and you expect it to fall to $100. So you go to a bank and say can I borrow 1 share of AAPL in exchange for some interest? They give you the share. You immediately sell it at $120. Later when the price of AAPL falls to $100, you buy 1 AAPL and return it to the bank. You are left with a $20 profit (minus the interest you paid).

Now, what if you have a short position (you borrowed 1 AAPL from the bank when the price was $120 and sold it at $120 immediately) and one day you wake up and see the price is $150. You freak out and decide to close your short position, meaning that you want to buy an AAPL as soon as possible and return it to the bank. The lowest ask price you find is $152. You buy at that price, thereby increasing the price of the stock by 2 more dollars. So you, and many other scared shorters, increase the demand for the share, adding momentum to the rise in price.

What if there are many many short positions, even more than the shares that are available to be sold? Then the many shorters who want to close their short position face a limited number of ask prices. A shorter buys at $151. Then the lowest available ask is $155. That is bought in a second too. Next one is $160.. and so on. Very quickly, the ask prices are going to be eaten out and the price will rise to levels unimaginable before. This is what we call a short squeeze.

Yeah, it may easily go up on Monday, but that's not the point. My point is that these straw dicks aren't admitting that they were wrong, got lost in the hype, and forgot about market volatility. 

They either claim they knew all along that it was gonna dip, despite blatantly denying it in previous posts

Or

They blame everything on one tweet... come on...

 are hot these days and for good reason, they fucking print. I‚Äôm playing a lot of them but imo Momentus is prime for meme potential as the likes we saw in SPCE in early jan/feb. Basically this company is a last mile delivery service for space. They have contracts with space x to basically hitch a ride in space x‚Äôs rocket and once in space, they disengage and deliver the goods themselves through their proprietary water propulsion system. Im not sure it‚Äôs legit but it sounds cool and musk has given his approval for them to use his rocket for a launch in Jan 2021.

Biggest con is that the CEO/founder is Russian or something and cannot have access to the tech because of some US law...idk how that even is enforceable as long as he‚Äôs in the position but it is what it is. 

Based on recent volume and run up, I think it‚Äôs priced in and people are potentially eyeing a buyout or a resolution. The CEO has publicly stated that the only reason he went the spac route was because players in the space industry already have deep pockets (space x, blue origin) and he needs funding to make bigger delivery vehicles that will take advantage of space x‚Äôs bigger rockets. 

As the days toward Jan 21 launch get closer, this should see a consistent run up and if everything goes well, it should follow SPCE‚Äôs price action.

Note: Just started learning investing so I can't say shit about financial records and patterns, but I know tech and software. 

**What makes Palantir special?**

Palantir is a tech company on the levels of Google, FB, Microsoft, etc. Look at r/cscareerquestions and you'll see it's highly sought after (take into consideration ethical questions engineers have against building military software first, because those voices will be particularly loud even though they're not the majority). 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dt1dlo/would\_you\_accept\_an\_offer\_from\_palantir\_if\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dt1dlo/would_you_accept_an_offer_from_palantir_if_its/)

They pay \~20% higher on average for engineers over Google, in fact.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=palantir+glassdoor+salaries+new+grad&oq=palantir+glassdoor+salaries+new+grad&aqs=chrome..69i57.5300j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=palantir+glassdoor+salaries+new+grad&oq=palantir+glassdoor+salaries+new+grad&aqs=chrome..69i57.5300j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

You can absolutely say that with those salaries Palantir is hiring some of the best if not \*the\* best in tech right now.

And unlike Google, who's culture and employees is known for fighting against evil practices and protesting the use of their tech for military applications ([https://theintercept.com/2019/03/01/google-project-maven-contract/](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/01/google-project-maven-contract/)), Palantir workers know what they're getting into, and they're compensated well for their work.

So.. Palantir has the talent of Google but not the same limitations in the industries and organizations they can work for. 

**What has Palantir made?**

If you look at their tagline they say they build "the world's leading software for data-driven decisions and operations", which is just corporate-speak for tracking every damn detail about you and everyone else's lives, for practically every possible use case of business analysis, machine learning / AI models, and targeted advertising platforms. Data / AI companies right now are hot, and all they have to do for new contracts is essentially just customize and rebrand pre-existing data dashboards they've already built. It seriously could not get easier, just because they haven't made a profit yet doesn't mean their work isn't highly lucrative.

But really, all the evidence you need for Palantir's undefatability is in their government contracts. Some of their clients since 2013 include: the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, and in 2020, they started working with the NHS to track help track and fight COVID (along with 3 other tech firms). Vox estimated they had 1.5 billion in federal contracts alone 4 months ago.

**Is AI / machine learning really that lucrative in military / government use?**

AI / ML algorithms work *shockingly* well, as they're usually trained with some specialization (like specifically to recognize faces in general, or a certain individual's face out of millions of others, or certain ethnicities.. you see where this is going).

There is **no** way AI won't be heavily incorporated in US military and police / government tactics in the next few years (if they aren't already incredibly reliant on AI). Facial recognition alone ensures AI's place in the police and military, until the next big tech breakthrough comes along.

Vaccine news for us means SPY goes up. For other people, it means the light at the end of the tunnel for the worst year of their lives. Stimmy news for us means the whole market pumps. For other people, it means maybe they will be able to afford healthy food soon. 



Once again, I‚Äôm not trying to get you to change how you trade or act, but just think about this shit. Think about the situation you‚Äôre in.

You wake up Christmas Morning...You see Elon tweeting out his ass, and you know TSLA is going to hit 694.20 any day. PLTR is at an all time high, and you and the boys know its got more room to soar. 

Unfortunately, you spend all your money on stupid ass gifts for your family, so youre going to miss the rockets this year. 

However, Uncle Ted knows you have recently taken a liking to investing, for what he believes is going towards "Retirement". Its 8:50...10 minutes before open.... and you're opening your gift from Uncle Ted.....500$ gift card for Robinhood.  Boom - the boys are back in it. You bet your ass youre immediately dumping it into 1/15/21 calls for PLTR and TSLA. You make enough money to finally pay off your Wife's boyfriend's student loans. 

It was a good Christmas.

Citron will prey on the weak minded to scare them into selling off their shares and calls in order to force the market to dip and allow them to buy in. Hey retards, you can do that too.
