 What stocks should i invest right now? Hello guys !

After some research , watching some videos , reading some books and articles about stocks and about financial education i've decided to starting entering in this world of investing.

Meanwhile, i don't have any experience on really buying stocks and what stocks could be profitable in 2,3 or even 5 years later.

I'm starting with 200€ and putting every month 200€ euros to investing. With that amount of cash in what companies/industries should i invest? NIO? TESLA? Tattoed Chef?

And what strategie do you guys think i've should follow ? Put the ammount on 3 or 4 stocks , waiting like 5 years and then sell it to build a new portfolio?

I'm here to hear all of your advices cause i'm new on this!

Cheers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Digital Banking will be huge for $SE - comparing market opp for them  

SE is has a 98B market cap.  

$SE just got the license to operate as a fully digital bank in Singapore. This is great for a number of reasons (strengthening shoppeepay) and to generating money as a bank. The data insights from one of the biggest online shopping platform giants partnered with banking can bring massive potential to the company.

Amazon only offers a creditcard, that is small compared to operating a fully digital bank. There are so many more products $SE can offer clients (mortgages, LoC, heloc). Singapore is also just the start.

ShopeePay is currently in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines. **It is only a matter of time before $SE is able to launch a digital bank in the other countries.** Looking at the careers pay there are hiring exec level positions for SeaMoney in the Philippines.

it also doesn't just stop there too. Where Shopee has a foothold in other countries such as Brazil. Sea is also working to building out the financial sector there too. Look at this posting for "**Head of Payments - (São Paulo)**"

SE is valued under 100B compare that to Amazon at over a trillion. There is huge potential for $SE, especially in these growing economies. If anyone has read Ray Dalio rise and fall of empires, it is about rise and fall of countries. Cathie Wood also treats these major FAANGs like cash cause they grow so slow, and she invests in the next set of FAANGs. Look how much she has been adding to her portfolio

TLDR: Invest in $SE (located in tiger economies, strong upside potential, lots of integration between online shopping and finance, cathie wood buys tons of it). Anything under $200/share is a steal for what this company will be worth

I currently have ITOT (ishares total US market fund) as my core position i.e. 70%. I want to know if it makes sense to switch it to something more growth focused like MGK or QQQ. These funds have better returns but are more focused.

I've been in the market for nearly 10 years and am comfortable at 100% equity. Here's my situation:

**TFSA (IRA equivalent)** \- Maxed out and invested in 80% XAW and 20% XIC

**RRSP (401k equivalent)** \- $30k cash sitting there to be used as a potential down payment using the home buyers plan (HBP).

**Canadian Margin Account** \- $13,000k cash (recently funded) and a tiny $2k position in EXRO

**USD Margin Account** \- $8k USD but all the cash is exposed to Cash Secured Puts on various stocks. This is my play account where I try different Options strategies. (This particular account is up around 25% since opening it in August, beating the S&P, so I think I'll keep playing until I either get burned or get a yacht).

I also have an employer matched RRSP which is invested in a 2055 LifePath fund. I contribute the full amount to match every pay period.

**TFSA:**

I plan to keep my TFSA in the low risk, low cost, globally diversified ETF's, and don't think I'll be changing that allocation. It's safe, slow, and boring, but this account holds the majority of my wealth so I'd generally like to keep it that way.

**RRSP:**

I was thinking of maybe buying a GIC in here since I don't think I'll buy a house in the next 12 months. Any thoughts on how else I could best use the cash in here?

**USD Margin:**

I'll likely keep messing around in the USD margin account with different stuff - thinking of going long ARKG with a portion of the funds, and use the rest of the money to keep selling Puts or go long on certain stocks as long as the bull market holds up into 2021.

**CAD Margin:**

This is the one I'm most unsure about. I've been able to fund it recently and it's currently sitting with $13k cash and a small $2k position in EXRO. I'm not sure if I should keep it in cash and use it to buy more XAW/XIC in case they go below my average cost basis in the TFSA, or use this cash towards individual stocks in the CAD Margin Account for a Dividend Growth portfolio, or do Norberts Gambit, transfer to USD and fund my USD Margin account further.

I also did a lot of “panic selling” when i had losses. In September I was down 15%. After that, I started doing my own research and investing more in reliable blue chip companies. The stocks I did take a chance on were calculated risk; I started out small and brought depending on how they performed. My biggest win with this strategy was Snap which gave me a %120 return. My total return at this point is 35% (and growing thanks to the bull run we are on). 

I also been reading this sub and r/dividends a lot. It greatly changed how I invest (for the better). Looking back, I lost money because I sold too quickly. So now, I have a mentality where I don’t want to sell anything. Again most of my stocks are quality companies, but is this mindset going to hurt me?

A little about myself and my investment goals:

I am <45 and have a good job (blessed). All of the money I am investing is not needed at time. I would be completely ok with breaking even. My goal is just to put my money somewhere that gives a better return than I would with a savings account at a bank. With my dividends alone I am achieving this goal. I also happen to follow a lot of business/stock news. It’s something I’ve always been very interested in. So I am an somewhat informed. I am also personally very bullish about the market next year. 

My biggest holdings:

Very nice positions with;

Apple
Snap
Twitter
Citi
Wells
Barclays
Pinterest
Pfizer
Nike
Disney
And various ETF’s including a very nice position with a clean energy ETF. 

Back to my initial question; will my aversion to selling hurt me? Should I learn to take my profits? What are some things I should consider when a stock reaches a certain level of profitability?

I can provide more info on these position as needed.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GOEV - Is Canoo poised to capture the commercial van segment for EVs? Commercial Vans are the second most popular vehicle in America behind the pickup truck. Canoo seems to be the only EV maker poised to bring a viable electric van to market. I first heard about this company when they went on Jay Leno's Garage. They've since pivoted and seem to have a more focused and well designed modular platform that works for all types of commercial vans ie - food trucks, delivery vehicles, tradesman/handyman vehicles, etc...

I found an interesting old quote from Peter Lynch that I really thought applied to this.

"And the single most important thing to me in the stock market, for anyone, is to know what you own. I am amazed at how many people own stocks, they would not be able to tell you why they own it. They couldn’t say in a minute or less why they own it. Actually, if you really press them down, they’d say, “The reason I own this is the sucker is going up.” And that’s the only reason. That’s the only reason they own it" - Peter Lynch_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which dividend stocks are worth investing in? Looking to open a portfolio strictly for dividend stocks.

Let's say I own 100 shares of XYZ and as of right now XYZ is trading for 30.00 bucks a share

Let's also say I want to sell all 100 shares that I own for it's current price of 30.00 bucks a share

Can I sell a covered call contract with a strike price of 30.00 set to expire 6 months out?  Would the contract get fulfilled almost instantly since the share price is already at the strike price?

Reason I ask is because covered calls sell for a lot more the further out they are.  So it seems to me I can collect a good premium selling a covered call 6 months out with a strike price the same as the current sale price, while also selling all my shares

Would this not work for any particular reason?

I’m currently a 20 year old university student who since starting to invest back in February 2020 has managed to accumulate 27 TSLA shares and 1.2 BTC. My current situation that I’m in is that I’m wondering if I should sell a portion of my TSLA position (perhaps 7 shares or more ?) to fund further BTC purchases.

Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of TSLA and Elon and have been since last year, I know the ins and outs of this company and plan to hold and buy more Tesla till I’m 60 years old. The thing is while I know that TSLA will revolutionize the entire automotive industry, Bitcoin on the other hand in my opinion has the potential to revolutionize the entire global monetary system. We are on the cusp of the gates of institutional investments flooding open within the next year with huge corporations such as SQ and Microstrategy taking it onto their balance sheets. I truly believe in a $100k BTC by 2022. 

I’m making aprox 150% return on both asset classes atm. But my thought process for selling TSLA for BTC is not just solely for monetary gain. I truly believe we are so early in bitcoins life time, I mean look around 99% of people don’t even understand the technology or how revolutionary it is. I think while I do have the ability to do so I should own as many BTC as I can since we are only at the start.

Based on the reaserch I did and my little knowledge I think that Logitech is a goo company to invest in middle to long-term; and I want to know what you guys think about the tools I used and if you think it's a good idea or not :

for those who don't know, Logitech is a swiss tech company that mainly deals with computer keyboards and mouses, created in 1981.
Idk if it's really popular in the US, but it works pretty good in Europe (without being part of the most popular brand, and I hope it will grow bigger in the futur).

​

2) It's based in swizerland, (but is also implanted in the US) and after doing some researche it seems that investors like the swiss stockmarket because it is pretty stable, and invest even more in swiss companies when the rest of the world's economy goes unstable (as I think is is now)

​

3) Logitech had a pretty good year, I was surprised to see that it was not so impacted by the coronavirus crisis compared to most companies

If we compare those results to the 5y or 10y charts we can see that it really is a big grow.

​

4) The implied volatility is pretty low and stable, And I've understood that an important volatility is not great for investment because the inverstors can buy but also sell really fast if they panic (I think)

Hope everyone is staying safe.

I wanted to see everyone’s ONE stock that they had a chance to buy but didn’t and choose a different stock instead and want to see what they learned from it.  

For example: MARCH 2020, I was in a dilemma of buying 1 AMZN at $1850 or ~4 TSLA at $460ish. I pulled the trigger on AMZN however missed the chance on TSLA. But I jumped on TSLA and still bought 4 around $1600 so still in the green. Lesson here for me is I should’ve paid more focus on the growth TSLA was having and should have gone with few TSLA at $460 rather than nothing.

Delta – An option’s delta is the rate of change of the price of the option with respect to its underlying security’s price. The delta of an option ranges in value from 0.0 – 1.00 for calls (0 to -1.00 for puts) and reflects the increase or decrease in the price of the option in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying asset price.  
Used to measure the change in value of a contract from a $1 change. Also is used to measure the probability of an Option Contract Expiring “ITM” (In-The-Money). For Example, a Delta of 0.40 can be seen as a 40% chance to Expire ITM.

Gamma – An option’s Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of its delta. The gamma of an option is expressed as a percentage and reflects the change in the delta in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying stock price.  
Measures the change in Delta from a 1$ movement in the underlying asset (stock, ETF, things like that). If the underlying moves an additional 1$ Then Delta would equal the Total of Delta + Gamma. After the First Dollar move, any additional moves in the same direction increases the value of Delta by the amount of Gamma.  
For Example, XYZ 100 12/31/20 Call for $1.00 and has a delta of .50 and a gamma of .05.  
The price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards so the new price of the contract becomes 1.50.  
The Price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards again so now we add both Delta AND Gamma to find the new value. (1.00 + 0.50 = 1.50) 1.50 + (.50 + .05) = 2.05 Value now.

Theta – An option’s theta is a measurement of the option’s time decay. The theta measures the rate at which the options lose their value, specifically the time value, as the expiration date draws nearer. Generally expressed as a negative number, the theta of an option reflects the amount by which the option’s value will decrease every day.  
For example, if your option contract is currently valued at 1.00 and you have a theta of -0.10, you will lose 0.10 worth of value off your contract every day. This number will change drastically throughout the day as will the other Greeks.

Vega – An option’s Vega is a measure of the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option price. Specifically, the Vega of an option expresses the change in the price of the option for every 1% change in the underlying volatility.  
Estimates the change in premium for each 1% change in the Implied Volatility (IV). There will be higher Vega on Contracts with more time. An increase in Vega increases the cost of the contract and vice versa.

Rho – Rho measures the change in Interest rates but is rarely used since Interest rates do not move much.

It is important to remember that these numbers associated with each Greek will likely change constantly throughout the life of the contract. There are other variables to consider like Implied Volatility, Volume, Open Interest, Days to Expiration (dte), the P/c Ratio, upcoming catalysts, and much more.

This is a very basic run down of the Greeks. You will not learn everything about options overnight. Enjoy!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top picks for early 2021 gains - AMZN, FB, NVDA What do these three tickers have in common?

Mr. Pan listed off what he said were Ant’s main problems. Its corporate governance was “not sound,” he said. It was “indifferent” to the law, “looked down” upon compliance requirements and engaged in “regulatory arbitrage.” It took advantage of its dominance, Mr. Pan said, to exclude rivals. And it harmed consumers’ interests.

The regulators have ordered Ant to “return to its payment origins,” Mr. Pan said, and to “strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance and wealth management financial activities.” Such demands could portend that the agencies will ask Ant to spin off those business lines, which have been increasingly important to its revenue.

Mr. Pan also said the regulators had ordered Ant to reorganize itself to ensure that it met capital requirements.

Question is: **shall we keep our options open and keep investing in Chinese firms such as NIO, BABA and many more?**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DII.B - Dorel Industries - privatization deal - what tends to happen to stock price when public shareholders refuse to accept stock offer in privatization/takeover deal? So a bit of backstory,

I started actively investing in months following the **Coronavirus Crash** of this year. I wanted to invest in bicycles first and foremost because I noticed an insane surge in popularity of bicycling in my own environment. It's clear that I was not the only one noticing this. I read articles about a potential "bike boom" online and looking up "bicycles" etc and some bike brands on Google Trends seems to have confirmed my suspicions. Interest in bicycles was skyrocketing. I've also always wanted to invest in bicycles anyway, because I genuinely believe that they're playing an increasingly important role in sustainable urban mobility and beyond that it's always going to be a fun leisure or outdoor exercise activity for a lot of people.

(relevant article: [https://www.statista.com/chart/21794/year-over-year-change-in-bicycle-sales-in-the-us/](https://www.statista.com/chart/21794/year-over-year-change-in-bicycle-sales-in-the-us/))

I found out most bicycle manufacturers & bike components are private (there are some public, but not many, i.e. Merida, Giant, Shimano). Then I came across this company, **Dorel Industries** (TSX: DII.B). This company really caught my interest. It's a holding company that has 3 divisions and they own a pretty well-known bicycle brand called **Cannondale**. They also own low-end bike brands (Schwinn) that they sell through big-box stores such as Walmart. They also own carseat brand **Maxi-Cosi** (among other brands) through their respective divisions. Interesting I thought, because I kept hearing about all kind of bikes selling out. I looked up as much information as I could find on this company. I tried to get an idea what the demand for their products was currently like. I came to the conclusion that they were **insanely undervalued** & that the company has a great outlook and can profit from the "bike boom" and home working wave.

tl;dr: I did my DD and bought some stocks in this company.

Anyway, the stock rose like 1100% from its dip in March. (I invested in this company a few months after the dip, so didn't quite make that 1100% profit haha, but still made a very good profit)

**But the above is not so important:**

Flashforward to November and the company announces a going-private deal.

>Montreal, Quebec - 11/13/2020  
>  
>Dorel Industries Inc. (TSX: DII.B, DII.A) (“**Dorel**”) today announced that based on the recommendation of an independent committee of Dorel’s Board of Directors (the “**Special Committee**”), Dorel has entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the “**Arrangement Agreement**”) pursuant to which a buyer group (the “**Buyer Group**”) led by an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (“**Cerberus**”) will acquire, for C$14.50 per share in cash, all of Dorel’s issued and outstanding Class A Multiple Voting Shares and Class B Subordinate Voting Shares, except for an aggregate of 4,009,410 Class A Multiple Voting Shares and 2,573,503 Class B Subordinate Voting Shares (the “**Rollover Shares**”) owned by Martin Schwartz, Alan Schwartz, Jeffrey Schwartz, Jeff Segel and members of their immediate families (collectively, the “**Family Shareholders**”), by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the *Business Corporations Act* (Québec) (the “**Arrangement**”).  
>  
>The Board of Directors of Dorel, acting on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of Dorel and fair to non-Family Shareholders (the “**Public Shareholders**”), unanimously approved the Arrangement and unanimously recommends that the Public Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement at a special meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the Arrangement.  
>  
>Norman M. Steinberg, Chair of the Special Committee, said, “Today’s announcement is the culmination of a comprehensive process that began in December 2019 when the Family Shareholders informed the Dorel Board of Directors of their intention to initiate a process to find a partner to take Dorel private. Over a period of eleven months, the Special Committee, with the advice of independent financial and legal advisors, has overseen and supervised this process, including contacting more than 25 potential financial sponsor partners, providing diligence materials to such partners, reviewing and considering non-binding proposals submitted by certain of these parties, and negotiating the financial and legal terms of the transaction proposed by the Buyer Group. The Special Committee believes that the Arrangement represents fair value for the Public Shareholders and is the best path forward for Dorel and all of its stakeholders. We are pleased to have been able to reach this agreement with the Buyer Group at a time when Dorel is benefitting from increased demand for its products amid the unique backdrop of 2020.”  
>  
>Martin Schwartz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dorel, said “The Family Shareholders believe that the Arrangement is a win for all of Dorel’s stakeholders, including the Public Shareholders. This transaction will enable Dorel to continue to serve our employees, business partners and other stakeholders, and positions Dorel on a path for continued growth.”  
>  
>“We are very pleased to partner with the Family Shareholders in this transaction,” commented Scott Wille, Senior Managing Director at Cerberus. “Dorel has a long and successful history based on its entrepreneurial culture. We are excited to collaborate with Dorel’s talented and dedicated managers and employees across all three of their business segments to further accelerate growth and enhance each segment’s leadership position.”  
>  
>The cash consideration to be paid to the Public Shareholders will be financed through a combination of cash funded by the Buyer Group and by Koch Equity Development LLC (“**KED**”) and committed financing from a group of lenders.

Now, in my eyes, CAD$ 14.50 still seems way too low for this company for various reasons. The share price has been hovering around CAD$ 14.50 ever since the announcement. 

Now to me, it seems like the holding family who have a 20% share in this company are pushing hard for public shareholders to sell their shares and accept the deal. But why would they even accept a deal that's at or even slightly below the current price? The share price reached up to CAD $ 15.95 after the great Q3 results, which was BEFORE the going-private deal was announced. Why would any public shareholder accept a deal at or slightly below the current share price? The company just posted great Q3 results in November!

Now two major institutional investors  (**Letko, Brosseau & Associates Inc**. and **Brandes Investment Partners**) in this company have already said they will **vote AGAINST the privatization deal and thus refuse the offer of CAD$ 14.50 per share,** because they believe it's too low:

&#x200B;

>MONTREAL, Dec. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Letko, Brosseau & Associates Inc., an independent investment manager that exercises investment control or direction over approximately 12.6% of the outstanding class B subordinate shares of Dorel Industries Inc. ("Dorel" or the "Company"), today reaffirmed its intention to vote AGAINST the proposed going private transaction of Dorel by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and the controlling shareholders of the Company (Martin Schwartz, Jeffrey Schwartz, Alan Schwartz and Jeff Segel or the "Family Shareholders"). The Family Shareholders, through their ownership of Dorel Class A and Class B shares, control approximately 20.3% of Dorel's outstanding shares on an economic basis and 60.8% on a voting basis.  
>  
>We have looked at the company's press release dated December 21, 2020, regarding its short-term outlook and have the following comments:  
>  
>The proposal is timed to take advantage of the recent period of depressed share price performance during which Dorel shares have traded at a large discount to the $20-$43 range of much of the last 20 years.  
  
>  
>\* We are long-term shareholders of Dorel and have confidence in the future of the company. We note that both the Family Shareholders and Cerberus are also looking beyond these short-term challenges themselves and are still committed to privatize the company.  
  
>  
>\* We continue to believe that TD Securities' Formal Valuation and Fairness Opinion of Dorel's fair value is too conservative and fails to take into account the long term opportunities of the company, with its portfolio of strong global brands, its international presence and its relations with some of the best retailers in the world (Amazon, Walmart, Wayfair).  
  
>  
>\* Minority shareholders are asked to sell their shares of Dorel at a time when the company has just reported record sales for the last twelve months to September 30, 2020. In its most recent quarter, the Company also reported the highest operating profit margin in any quarter since 2012. We also note wide spread reports in recent months of depleted inventories and shortages of bicycles which suggests continued strong sales reports.  
  
>  
>\* According to the Management Information Circular, the arrangement with Cerberus gives Family Shareholders a 6.4% increase in their ownership of the business from 20.3% to 26.7% at no apparent cost. In addition, Family Shareholders may receive an additional 4.8% should certain targets be met. We estimate these benefits to be worth $53 million based on the value of the proposed transaction at $14.50 per share.  
>  
>Letko Brosseau intends to vote all shares under its control against this transaction. We have been shareholders for many years and wish to participate in both the full recovery and the potential Dorel offers, alongside Family Shareholders and other minority shareholders.

>SAN DIEGO, Dec. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Brandes Investment Partners, L.P., which on behalf of its investment advisory clients holds approximately 7% of the outstanding class B subordinate shares of Dorel Industries, Inc., today announced its intention to vote AGAINST the going-private transaction proposed for Dorel by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and Dorel's controlling shareholders.  
>  
>Brandes is a long-term investor in Dorel and believes the proposed offer significantly undervalues the company. Brandes continues to believe in the long-term upside potential of Dorel's shares and notes that the controlling shareholders are not themselves participating in this initial phase of the proposed transaction.

If you read their earnings report for the past Q2 and Q3 of this year, the results were extremely good (record revenue + record operating profit margin since 2012) and the outlook of this company seemed very good. The stock still seems undervalued to me.

But now it seems like the management along with Cerberus are trying to take company private on the cheap by sowing somewhat vague doubt about supply chain issues. I don't know about corporate finances, but something it smells a bit fishy to me.

So would it be a good idea to invest right now in this company? The downside has to be limited to $ CAD 14.50 right? But the upside can only be higher if the shareholders vote against the going-private deal. What could happen if the public shareholders vote against the going-private deal? Is Dorel's management + Cerberus going to make a new offer with a higher premium? Will the stock instantly rise because of the expectation of higher offer?

Personally, I believe the bicycling wave is here to stay on the long-term, and I believe friendlier US/China trade relations will also benefit Dorel Industries' other divisions.

What does this mean for the stock going forward, anyone dares to speculate?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What you need to know about SEC Filings **SEC FILINGS**

Form 8-k

This form is used to report newsworthy events to the SEC, thereby making them available to the public. Included are items such as change in management, change In the company’s name, mergers or acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and major new product introductions or sale of a product line. A Form 8-K HAS to be filed when a member of the board of directors resign over a disagreement. The 8-K is filed within four business days of the occurrence. This form is used only by domestic issuers, foreign issuers are exempt. Although ADR’s are registered with the SEC, they too are exempt because of the underlying security of foreign issue.

Form 10-K

Most domestic public issuers must file an annual report to the SEC on FORM 10-K. This report is a comprehensive overview of the company’s business and financial condition and includes financial statements that have been audited by an independent accountant. Do not confute this with the annual report to shareholders, which also contains and audited financial information than the annual report, while the annual report will have much more detail about the company itself and its future plans.

The Filing Deadlines depend upon the company’s public float. For Companies with a float of $700million or more, the Form 10-K deadline is 60-days after the close of the fiscal year; $75 million, but not $700 million, it is 75 days; and less than $75 million is due at 90 days.

Form 10-Q

Because one year between filings is a long time and a lot can happen quickly, we also have this form, and it is filed quarterly (Q for quarterly). It contains unaudited financial statements and for all but the companies with a public float of less than $75 million, it must be filed within 0 days of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year (no 10-Q is filed at the end of the fourth quarter—that information is taken care of by the filing of the 10-K). Those smaller firms file theirs within 45 days of the end of the quarter.

Annual Reports

When it comes to publicly traded companies, in general, all shareholders must receive a copy of the issuer’s annual report. For those too lazy to access EDGAR, this is the most detailed information they can get on the company’s financial position. Unlike the Form 10-K, this is usually a professionally prepared piece with just as much used for marketing purposes as it is for providing information. There is usually a welcoming letter from the CEO/Chairman of the board, and it is generally loaded with beautiful pictures of smiling people (employees and customers) and the company’s facilities. New plans for products and programs are discussed and voting proxies are included.

Form S-1

SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the SEC for public companies that are based in the U.S. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies usually file SEC Form S-1 in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO). Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition and provide a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities.

SEC Form S-1 is also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Additionally, the SEC requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue.

Foreign issuers of securities in the U.S. don’t use SEC Form S-1 but instead must submit an SEC Form F-1.

Form S-3

SEC Form S-3 is a regulatory filing that provides simplified reporting for issuers of registered securities.

An S-3 filing is utilized when a company wishes to raise capital, usually as a secondary offering after an initial public offering has already occurred.

In order to utilize the simplified process, firms must first meet a certain set of eligibility criteria.  
The SEC form S-3 is sometimes filed after an initial public offering (IPO) and is generally filed concurrently with common stock or preferred stock offerings.

There are a variety of other requirements that must be met for a business to file the S-3 form. In the 12 months prior to filling out the form, a company must have met all debt and dividend requirements. The SEC Act of 1933 also requires that these forms be filed to ensure that essential facts about the business are disclosed upon the company’s registration of securities. Doing so allows the SEC to provide investors with specifics about the securities being offered and works to eliminate fraudulent sales of such securities.

Form S-4

SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders consist of directors and officers of the company, as well as any shareholders, owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock. The forms ask about the reporting person's relationship to the company and about purchases and sales of such equity shares.  
Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders .If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result. It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.

Schedule 13D

The Schedule 13D is also known as the "beneficial ownership report" and is required when any owner acquires 5% or more of the voting shares in a company. The report must be filed within 10 days of reaching the 5% threshold. It provides the following information: The acquirer's name, address and other background information, Type of relationship this owner has with the company, Whether the person has been convicted of a crime in the past five years. An explanation of why the transaction is taking place, The type and class of the security, and The origin of funds used for purchases.

Form 144

Form 144 is required when corporate insiders want to dispose of company stock. The Form 144 is a notice of the intent to sell restricted stock, typically acquired by insiders or affiliates in a transaction not involving a public offering. The stock is restricted because it must meet certain conditions before becoming transferable. The transaction, or at least part of it, is made within 90 days of filing. Form 144 is required when the amount sold during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or $50,000.

Initial Product Offering (IPO)

A corporation’s first sale of common stock to the public.

Secondary Offering

A Sale of Securities in which one or more major stockholders in a company sell all or a large portion of their holdings; the underwriting proceeds ae paid to the stockholders rather than to the corporation. Typically, such an offering occurs when the founder of a business (and perhaps some of the original financial backers) determine that there is more to be gained by going public than by staying private. The offering does not increase the number of shares of stock outstanding.

Regulation D (Private placements continued.)

The provision of the Securities Act of 1933 that exempts from registration offerings sold in private placements. Rule 506(b) limits the Sale to a maximum of 35 NON-accredited investors during a 12-month period with no advertising permitted, while Rule 506(c) permits advertising but requires that all purchasers be accredited investors.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What I think GME could do, and why there is life beyond the short squeez I've been pretty reluctant to open a post like this, since idk what im talking about, but after the 14th near identical "why gme??" style questions, I thought i'd share my 2 cents, might help someone understand what we see in GME.

First of all, quick disclaimer, it's all speculations of "what could be" and I'm not an expert. It will be obvious if you read my post.2nd, I'm going to base many speculations on myself, my friends or close circle, I do believe that most things I'll say are true for most ppl, but who knows. 3rd, not going to talk about technicals and the short squeez, that has been done way too many times already. Now let's begin.

Currently Gamestop is viewed as a brick-and-mortar seller and reseller of consoles and games. That's a failing business model. I know that, you know that, even their board knows that by now. It's clear that a new profile for the company is needed and the conservative option is transforming into doing the same thing, but online. Most people stop here when thinking about Gamestop and I do believe that the market as a whole has stopper here too. Meaning it's more or less priced in.

But! There have been way different ideas than that floating around, by the board or by Cohen. 

Reselling used electronics and parts of PCs. 

There are many-many people out there, who cant afford the newest generation of (e.g.) GPUs, especially kids and young adults, the main target audience for gaming anyway. At the same time, buying used graphics cards or other parts riight now is risky. These are delicate-easily amortized pieces of hardware that I, nor anyone I know, would be confident buying from Ebay or facebook or whatever. 

People need to trust the seller with used goods, and Gamestop could turn into the brand you think of that will not sell you used parts that fry in 2 mins and deny you a refund. Every one who talks about chewy here mentions their great customer service/customer experience and why that makes them bullish long term on their stock. It's not far fetched to think that Cohen can do that again, with gme.

Yes there is already serious competition here, but not something that's impossible to deal with. Imo.

Esports

At first glance I thought there is absolutely no reason to think about it. The biggest esports games are already organized by professionals and are much more grandiose in natury than what GME could do.

What GME can do however is targeting the lower levels. Teams that are either semi-pro or even "worse", without their own gaming house and all. Basically a gaming netcafè that isnt terrible. 


Hosting amateur events. 

Self explanatory imo, there are plenty of offline tournaments, events that could be orgenized in or by gamestop. 

The continuation of that, organizing esport events for games that are not popular enough to fill literal stadiums, but that still garner decent attention.

I'm not even going to pretend that I know how much revenue these could bring in. Probably nothing extra ordinary, but the marketing it brings can be extra-ordinary. 



These are some minor ideas, clearly not specifics. Just to show that there are ways this company can rebrand itself and not stay the brick and mortar game reseller everyone thinks and prices it to be. 

There are alternatives and Lord Cohen might find a good one. Without the premise of a shorr squeez i'd not recommend anyone to buy in at 20.

Is anyone else sick of meet Kevin, graham stephen, tech lead, and other well known YouTube personalities pumping this trash brokerage for the stock promo. 

All these guys communicate regularly and are always looking to make a buck, that’s fine. I get that, I’m a capitalist too. 

However, I can’t appreciate this pumping. Firstly, the platform is absolute trash. It’s clunky and is not user friendly. All the technical availabilities are blown away by any other brokerage such as TD, Merrill, schwab etc. 


“Webull, founded by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. alum Wang Anquan, has increased its roster of brokerage clients by about tenfold this year, to more than 2 million, by offering free stock trades with a slick online interface.”

They claim webull is safe however I am not trusting of this platform, even moreso nowadays with the new laws going into place against China. However what I really don’t appreciate is the YouTube celebs making money off broke millennials giving away their data to this Chinese conglomerate. Know where your money is going.

But what happens in a bear market? I find myself with most of my capital locked up in positions I might have opened a few days before at ATH. The only thing i can do is just wait for the price to go back up as I will have nearly no buying power to buy the dips.

I have been diving in pharma stocks the past few months and have made some decent gains and would like to share my next move.  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals (OSMT) will have a new drug up for the PUDFA review on 12/29. 

# Past Success  

The last time OSMT had positive PUDFA results was July 9th when their drug Upneeq was passed by the FDA. They started the day at $6.38 and topped out the next trading day at $9.67 for their 52 week high trading up to 4.7 million in volume.  

# Current Activity

Currently OSMT is sitting at $5.12 and trading at 212,000 volume as of the 24th. The drug up for approval on 12/29 is Ontinua ER (arbaclofen). This drug aims to raise the standard of living in patients with MS. It aims to treat muscular spasticity which can range from tight muscle to sever pain and muscle cramps. There are currently a few drugs on the market that aim at treating the pain caused by MS Spasticity, but with Ontinua ER (arbaclofen) OSMT aims to use a different pathway. Ontinua ER (arbaclofen) uses an extended release formula that is not currently available in this method of symptom management, which will allow for a decrease in dose strength, dependency, and frequency, similar to long lasting insulin or birth control. The final clinical trial had very promising results showing that all variables tested decreased significantly and standard of living also rose all in accordance with previous trial results. It was also found to be safe and effective over time. Ample dose was found to be 40mg-80mg depending on the severity of the symptoms. The patients in the final trail were monitored for a complete year. Note the major competitor in the niche market Baclofen was shown to cause more adverse side effects and was not as effective as Ontinua ER (arbaclofen).
