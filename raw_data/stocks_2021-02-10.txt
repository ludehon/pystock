Those who know about this company know that it barely makes a profit despite all the revenue they bring in, despite being a monopoly almost. The pandemic has absolutely ruined the concert industry the most I would argue, they haven’t been able to have ANY shows, and won’t be having full capacity shows anytime soon.

Livenation seems like it will win this, but the plan was only until June 1st, 2020. Livenation’s big concert’s don’t usually kick off until May, they do have small venue concerts year round but the money is nowhere near the same as it’s amphitheater shows, it wouldn’t make a dent at all.

I've been investing (passively and actively) since 2010. All of this market euphoria has me putting in stop loss orders for my ROTH IRA (no tax concerns!). I understand the concepts for stop-loss and stop-limit-loss, but have never entered one. For 99% of my stocks I know what to do. I have 1 stock, however, that I have made massive gains in just the past 2 years and was hoping to get people's advice on how to best set a stop-limit/stop-loss that locks in gains, but also doesn't risk losing my great entry point in a company that long-term I believe will continue to grow. Lots of background here, apologies for the story.

Anonymizing the details mainly to avoid any bias due to the stock/sector/etc, and let the focus be on approaching the stop-limit aspect. I promise you though, it's not GME/AMC lol.

The company is a "turn-around story" in an industry I believe will continue to grow over the coming years and decades. I believe in the company/product as well and it is currently profitable with regular earnings beats, and is growing quickly. However, I think this year's euphoria has led to valuations that mean it would be gutted pretty hard in the event of a big market correction or recession. While I believe it will eventually grow into it's valuation; I also don't want to risk losing these gains due to FOMO.

Purchased 250 sh @ $1 in 2019, today it is at $50/sh. That's 50x gain in \~2 years. It is now 60% (!!!!) of my ROTH. I've already sold some and locked in 20x of my initial investment, so it's house money at this point.

I want to lock in a much of that as possible, but don't want to prematurely sell just because of a market spook or missed earnings. I also don't want to sell too late and miss out on 10x-20x+ gains in the event of a bad crash as I believe it will recover one day and I have such an incredible entry point. I could buy-the-dip at that point, but it's already 60% of my ROTH. It could also take many, many years to return to the price point it's at now and I lose all of that quick profit just because I had FOMO about missing out on more.

I'm so conflicted.

AFC Energy is simply a company with extremely cool technology and could soon be in the focus of the masses!

 Charging points and domestic wall boxes for electric cars have one thing in common: They are dependent on the power grid.  This means that renewable electricity is not always guaranteed.  And charging is not possible in the event of blackouts.  After ten years of development, "AFC Energy" from Great Britain has presented the first charging solution in the world that works independently of the power grid and is instead powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.  An inverter transfers the energy generated by the fuel cell to a charger.  This is ultimately available as electricity to the electric car.  The system, which goes by the name of "Ch2arge", also includes a 48-volt battery storage system, which helps out during consumption peaks, and a hydrogen storage tank that enables 140 charging processes.

  AFC Energy has a large partner agreement with ABB and has seen strong growth in general:

 (I do not provide professional investment advice and I only travel here as a private person!
 Everyone bears their own risk and bears their own responsibility!)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question - judging stocks after market closes Just a question.

How do you guys judge what is going to happen to relatively volatile stocks overnight? Say you jump on a stock early that has had a good rise that day - and right now there seems to be a couple of these every day - what methods/thought processes do you use when it comes to deciding on holding after the market closes overnight, or selling beforehand? Any telltale signs or indicators to judge?

I say this because I've seen stocks like Ocugen and Applied UV have incredible rises throughout a day, remain consistent up until the market closes, and then once the market reopens the next day, dip pretty heavily and haven't recovered (yet). Whereas others, some who seem to have even less reason to continue to rise after assessing with some degree of DD, will go from strength to strength and continue an upward trajectory throughout the next day. Obviously if you're planning on holding for the long term then naturally these dips shouldn't bother you, but if you're in it for the short haul?

We'd all be rich if there was a fail-safe way to predict the future and have a concrete answer for this so I'm not expecting that, but just some pointers and things to look toward to make a better educated assessment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have a very very novice question, buying cheap and doubling down

I was hovering over Webull's list of offerings coming tomorrow, and one in particular that caught my eye was AFC Gamma ($AFCG).

According to their [website, AFC Gamma](https://afcgamma.com/) is about the following:

*Advanced Flower Capital (AFC Gamma) is a leading provider of institutional loans to high-quality cannabis companies nationwide in all aspects of production: cultivation, processing, and distribution. We offer loans and related facilities, generally secured by substantial assets which rely on a repeatable process that screens for creditworthy, high-profile borrowers. With years of combined lending expertise and real-estate experience, AFC Gamma’s principals are now focused on the exponential growth of the cannabis industry.*

So, a REIT for weed companies. I believe this week, a lot of us learned the power of the cannabis industry, and expect to see [a ton of growth in the sector within the next couple of years.](https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/u-s-cannabis-industry-market-projections-up-20-to-30-billion-by-2025/) A cool premise for a new company coming to the market, in a sector with tons of potential, and a successful CEO.

# Now heres why I'm not too thrilled about this company:

I can't find a single shred of financial data from these guys. Literally, all I could find was [this link](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/76032/Cannabis-finance-REIT-AFC-Gamma-sets-terms-for-$100-million-IPO). Maybe i'm just horrible at DD as a relatively new investor, but I can't find a shrap of data on Webull, nor AFCG's website. Probably because the company was created less than a year ago, however, I would love to see what they've done thus far.

With that in mind, this stock sadly becomes a faith play, or something along the lines of, "Weed stocks go up AFCG go up." Primitive, but hey, that's pretty much the entire market of 2021 thus far.

Personally, I don't have much excitement for the company. I plan on buying the IPO, but I do not expect the company to explode upon impact.

(UK) I've a quick question for my friends based in the UK. I recently discovered that you don't pay any taxes when you invest through an ISA (duh!). But unfortunately I've invested a bit of money in my Trading212 Investing account before discovering this.

I've read that the tax-free allowance is £12,300 per year (at least for this year). Which means that, if I liquidate my shares a little bit every year, I'm not going to pay taxes on them? Let's say this year I only liquidate about £12000 worth of shares. And then next year I liquidate another £12000 etc. I don't have to pay taxes as long as I'm not exceeding the free-allowance, right?

I'm now investing through ISA only for the most part, but I was wondering if there's a way to avoid those taxes on my Investing account by simply liquidating a little bit every year. I obviously don't want to liquidate stuff now because I'll lose my average price on all of my shares and also the compounding, so there's no point. But I'd like to do this when I'll want to liquidate some shares in the future.

&#x200B;

Ok all, for the most part everyone understood what I was saying in the above post but I had some people who didn't seem to understand what I was saying so I wanted to explain it further.

&#x200B;

Typically, in any merger/buyout, the stocks will not trade PRECISELY at the price that they will merge. They will generally trade at some sort of discount (around 5%) which is what I expected on APHA and TLRY. The merger agreement states that for every APHA share you hold into the merger, you will receive .84 (roughly) shares of TLRY. So, theoretically, the price of APHA should be .84 \* TLRY stock price (minus a small discount, aka the 5% I referred to earlier). If you look at the current prices: TLRY is at 60 and APHA is at 27. If TLRY is at 60, APHA should be at 60 \* .84 which is 50.4. Vice versa, if APHA is at 27, TLRY should be at (1/.84) \* APHA price which is 32. All these numbers are rounded but you get the jist. 

&#x200B;

So the trade is this: you short the higher stock (TLRY) and buy the lower stock (APHA).

In this situation, you would short 84 shares of TLRY for every 100 shares of APHA you buy. So let's look at what happens in some scenarios, assuming you buy APHA at 27 and short TLRY at 60:

1. **TLRY goes to the moon (let's say 100 dollars). -** In this scenario, it isn't specific what APHA would do but IF THE MERGER GOES THROUGH, APHA should go to 84 bucks (.84 \* 100). So in this scenario, you lose money on the TLRY short and make money on the APHA long. 40 increase in share price for TLRY \* 84 shares = - $3,360. 57 increase in share price of APHA \* 100 shares = $5,700 gain. Net profit is $5,700 - $3,360 = 2,340.
2. **TLRY shits the bed (goes to 20). -** In this scenario, again we don't know what APHA would do but IF THE MERGER GOES THROUGH, APHA should go to 20 \* .84 which is 16.8. So you lose money on the APHA long - $10.2 decrease in share price \* 100 shares = - $1,020. You make money on the TLRY short - $40 decrease in share price \* 84 shares = $3,360. Net profit is $3,360 - $1,020 = $2,340.

If more scenarios are wanted I'll edit and continue but hopefully this is enough. Let me know if I made any mistakes in this post. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ASSUMES THE MERGER GOES THROUGH.

Hope this clears up my previous post!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 30-day hold and its implications Hi all, my work requires me to hold (and pre-approve) all equity and ETF trades for my brokerage account. As a result, I can’t be as agile as I’d like in taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities. GME is a recent and obvious example – I’d likely jump in early on in its initial run-up, but since I’d have to hold for 30 days, this is a deal breaker, and the same goes for penny stocks. 

This leads me to my next point which is time in the market vs market timing. As a result of my 30-day hold, I’ve developed a strategy (or reliance) on timing the market. I’ll wait for a sizable dip, preferably in all sectors (so I’m confident it’s systemic), and jump in. I’ll wait around 30 days for a green day and sell off to repeat the process.

Basically a monthly arbitrage strategy. 

I know that time in the market is very important, but I can’t shake the importance of entry price – since I’m locked in for 30 days, I would really like that entry to be the best price possible – thus timing the market. One might say that the 30 days hold inherently lends itself to long-term investing, and I’m curious to hear opinions on this. 

TLDR: work requires me to hold stocks for 30 days, so I’ve defaulted to a monthly arbitrage strategy where I buy and red days and sell after 30 days on green days.

I'm looking for a bear thesis on MGM (and a bull thesis on PENN & DKNG) **Full disclosure - I began a small position (\~3% of portfolio) in MGM in July 2020. This is not financial advice and nothing I say here should be interpreted as such.**

I've been very interested in gambling for as long as I can remember and would like to think I have a good handle on the space. Like many others, I'm bullish on the gambling industry and think it's going to be an even bigger space.

What I can't figure out is why the majority of the money is flowing into DKNG (Cathie Wood & ARK are buying) & PENN instead of MGM. What are Cathie and others seeing in DKNG and to a lesser extent (Barstool stake complicates things in terms of a true comparison IMO) PENN that I'm not?

Looking at the balance sheets, MGM has (significantly) less LT debt, more cash on hand per share and already does double the revenue of PENN. DKNG isn't profitable (growth, I know but still) and doesn't do anywhere near the revenue MGM does. Not to mention they don't have any physical locations (which can be argued as a plus right now) but MGM's properties are some of the best known casinos/hotels in the world, there's major value in the equity itself even if COVID is reducing in-person revenue.

In terms of the sports betting app/experience, I've used DKNG but don't have an account with PENN or MGM. I've dabbled on both websites though and have friends that have used both, all say that there really aren't any discernible differences between the three. If anything, mid-20s types like myself  gravitate to PENN because of the Barstool promotions (but I don't think it's attracting big money players, just the smaller players who want the merch/sweat.)

The main thing I can't get over though is that the margins on sports betting aren't anywhere near as lucrative as casino games and slots are. I don't see how this changes meaningfully in the future; the only thing I can think of would be DKNG or PENN taking out all other competitors and juicing the hold at their books. MGM doesn't need to rely on its sports betting business, but it's the second or third most used product in almost every state they currently operate in.

Both DKNG & PENN have seen runups of over 200% in the last year. MGM is up just 13.5% over the last year. We're closer now than ever to a return to normalcy (which is bullish for MGM and it's physical locations.) DKNG's market cap is $7 billion more than MGM's. What gives here?

I also invested heavily into clean energy thinking the same. I know these sounds like humble brags but I’ve seriously come to a problem. I’ve made ridiculous amounts of money for me and my family at this age but it’s all unrealized gains. I thought I’d maybe be above market average if I’m lucky and be well off by the time of 30. 
       I have it drilled into my brain to not sell but when the average p/e of my portfolio goes from 25 to 200 in the matter of 4 months I don’t know what to do. If I sell I’m taking a heavy short term capital gains hit. I still believe in these companies long term but there so ahead of what there valuations should be I genuinely don’t know what to do.

Ever since the GME fiasco and the other sub WHICH WILL NOT BE NAMED, I have seen countless posts that included what I suspect to be misleading information.

Haivision Systems Inc, trading on the TSX as HAI is a $311.1 million market cap company that is a “leading provider of infrastructure solutions for the video streaming market, servicing enterprises and governments globally”. I first came across this company using my screens of high revenue growth, “low” debt/capital and increasing cash from operations over the last 3 years. The strong fundamentals and low area of interest really caught my attention and initiated my summary and analysis in the company below.

**Haivision Business Summary** 

They focus on the three main stages of real time video workflows

* **Contribution**. After image acquisition through sensors or cameras, contribution represents the first mile where the video is captured/encoded at live event venues, executive boardrooms, or theaters of mission critical operation, as an example, and transported to broadcast facilities, production studios, video processing centers, and others.
* \*\*Distribution.\*\*Distribution represents the middle mile where video can be manipulated or produced and then routed to broadcast towers, various datacenters, or remote branch offices, and others.
* \*\*Delivery.\*\*Delivery represents the last mile where video is packaged in consumable formats and transported to reach its intended audience at home, over the internet, in auditoriums, or at remote work locations, to name a few, where the video is then decoded/displayed.

Info from annual report\^\^\^. To summarize the gibberish, they process information from cameras/sensors so you (the customer) can see the video.

Currently, most of their revenues come from hardware sales, perpetual software licences, and training and professional services which is $62,676,477 million representing 75% of total 2020 revenues. However, in the latest earnings report they made it one of their top priorities to focus on their cloud and self-service SaaS. This will result in a greater market share and drive recurring revenue. Since 2017, they have doubled their R&D and have been coming up with continuous products and innovations. $19.4 millions of R&D in the last fiscal year is a lot considering it only had $83.1 million on revenue. The result of this has been a beta projects such as the Haivision Connect SaaS video distribution platform. This is one of the many products they are introducing to the market to increase market share and profits. Top managements estimate that the R&D will bring more products in 2022 contributing to more market share.

**Customers:** 

As of the 2020 fiscal year, they had a customer retention ratio of 72% in which 27% of their total revenue was recurring. Although it is a small company, it has had a list of big clients such as

· U.S. Department of Defense

· 32 companies’ part of the fortune 500

· Microsoft

· NFL

· Fox Sports

· Riot Games

· LinkedIn

· Plenty more

Here is a link to some of the “customer successes” they have had: [https://www.haivision.com/resources/customer-success/](https://www.haivision.com/resources/customer-success/)

**Industy Trend:** 

Video streaming is not more prevalent considering the currency conditions. With us being online, companies have accelerated the purchase of many of Haivisions products. According to the research nester, “the global video streaming infrastructure market is valued at $15 billion which is expected to grow at a 15% CAGR from 2019 to 2028”.

**Financials:** 

Here are pictures to the income statement and ratios page. It has grown like crazy and is profitable now, and the ratios are incredible for the growth prospect and clientele it has. I am not going to speak further on the fundamentals since they speak for themselves.

This SubReddit group does not allow me to add pictures so here is a link to the same post with the financials: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/lh15d2/haivision\_dd\_undervalued\_and\_why\_i\_am\_bullish/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/lh15d2/haivision_dd_undervalued_and_why_i_am_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Additional Information:** 

1. Since this is a company that just IPO’d, you may wonder if their past financial statements are accurate and can be trusted. Deloitte looked at the 2017- current fiscal year and said the financial statements were presented fairly.
2. Haivision is looking to acquire a company within the first month of revenues between 10-20 million
3. According to Capital IQ there are no institutional investors yet. In the latest earnings call, most were retail investors. There was only 1 analyst.
4. A decently high percentage of insiders own the stock (29.32%)
5. They are also expanding internationally
6. Countless awards [https://www.haivision.com/about/awards/](https://www.haivision.com/about/awards/)
7. “14 years of positive adjusted EBITDA”

**Tl;dr:** 

**Relatively small market cap with some big clients. Profitable company in a growing business and is relatively unheard of.**

I have posted other DD in my previous post history in case you are interested in looking at them! I didn’t get much love from them!

My positions: Just under 200 shares.

I am not a financial advisor, investment advisor, research analyst or anything. I am just summarizing some key, interesting points on why I think this company is undervalued. Invest at your own risk_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $KO Earnings Report First time doing a lot of due diligence on a company on my own and first time really going through a company's earnings report - beyond just reading about it on Finance Reddit/Twitter. Please let me know if I got anything wrong, because I'm sure I'm either misinterpreting something or don't understand the situation fully. 

My interest on $KO was peaked by a post on either r/stocks, r/StockMarket or r/investing about their stock following sugar price trends - particularly, as sugar price lowers from March to July, $KO share price channels upwards before dropping down towards September and October. 

Looking at the trends from 2010 until now, it seemed like a pretty good hypothesis. I jumped in on 20 shares under the assumption that: 1. this trend will hold true for 2021, 2. $KO hadn't recovered completely from their Covid crash, 3. they're undervalued given that they're not a hype-growth stock and won't pick up traction on social media, and 4. as we start to recover, we'll need to buy more drinks for parties! 

This outlook on $KO might be naive, since I didn't look at any of the numbers but in my mind: the worst case is that I'll have a pretty dividend stock in my portfolio that I'd want to hold forever anyways, and in the best case, I'll be able to swing it for a nice upside once the company starts picking up.

There was a mini run-up to earnings, but I haven't seen a significant drop afterwards. The company was trading at around $46-48 and is currently sitting now at $49, from $51 this morning. This isn't as insane as $CRSR or $PLTR or any of the other companies I've seen talked about heavily on social media; again, could be because the company's just flying under the radar. 

I'm not a financial advisor or services professional. Not very financially literate beyond looking at charts a little bit, following Elliot Wave Theory and reading up on news about companies. I'm just a college student. 

Anyways, that brings me to the Earnings Report. They spent a lot of time talking about an ongoing tax-investigation by the I.R.S. I don't understand this fully, and would appreciate anyone who does to educate me in the comments. It seems like they're optimistic to the case, but the numbers that worry me are a 3.5% increase in tax rate, and a potential liability of at most $12 billion. 

Zack's Consensus EPS for $KO: $0.41. Q4 reported EPS: $0.47, beating estimates by 14%. This is compared to their previous EPS of $0.44 as well. Post earnings estimate was: $0.45; actual was $0.55. 

2019 revenue was $9.07 billion; 2020 revenue was $8.61 billion. 

The CEO himself understands the outlook for the company: “*the progress we made in 2020, including the actions taken to accelerate the transformation of our company, gives us confidence in returning to growth in the year ahead... While near-term uncertainty remains, we are well-positioned to emerge stronger from the crisis.*”

Those numbers seem like a mixed bag, both optimistic and pessimistic. It seems as though with the company restructuring in response to the pandemic that they're radically slimming down and streaming their supply-chain and should come out of the pandemic better than before. I don't want to bet on a recovery play, because there's no sure-fire guarantee on when this whole COVID thing will end. However, I'm optimistic that Coca-Cola won't be going anywhere soon. I'm also holding a few shares of $DIS, and if the reasoning for $DIS as a good stock holds, then I don't think $KO as a hold is far-fetched either: i.e. the pandemic will be over eventually, $DIS will be able to open their parks ($KO will be able to sell more of their drinks), and that surely implies that the stock price is under-valued currently. Though, $DIS is heavily expanding into other ventures that they have a very strong foothold in, namely streaming, and I haven't heard much similar news for $KO. 

That's my due diligence on the company. I'm still holding and I don't think it'll be a bad play at worst. Let me know if I missed anything or how I should educate myself further on the topic.

I'm super familiar with the pharmaceutical industry, so my go to has been either JNJ directly, or an ETF/Index fund like VHCIX/VGHCX.  (Not a bad position to be in pre-pandemic!)

I also bought into PBF, though they suspended their dividends during the pandemic - which makes sense.  They've paid a consistent $0.30 per quarter - not so desirable at $30/share (4% return) but INCREDIBLY desirable at $4/share (30% return).

Shares have been hovering around $10 recently, which is still a 12% return.  My feeling is even if dividends DON'T return for 2 years, yes I will have lost out on a few rounds of income, but when it returns I will have a significantly larger stake in the company.

*(It's worth noting their sister company ($PBFX) has continued to pay a dividend)*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A brief look and DD on QUBT I’m sure everyone is aware of AI and how artificial intelligence has become this buzzword that people use to sell something or grab your attention. There’s no doubt that artificial intelligence is here to stay and that it’s impacts have been tremendous, but there is a new player in town that goes by the name of Quantum Computing. A brief explanation of QC(Quantum Computing), QC completely changes the way computational problems are solved. On a classical computer you are dealing with binary pieces of information that can only solve certain types of problems, this means that some things are unsolvable. Enter QC, this is able to use particles slowed down to bear absolute zero and use their motion as means for computing(this is a very brief explanation and I urge you to research more if you are interested). Because of QC companies can now solve problems that were previously impossible, and right now there are a very limited amount of companies invested in QC. Companies like MSFT, GOOG and IBM own and create quantum computers but right now there is no easy way for businesses to access there potential. QUBT has made proprietary software that bridges the gap between the two and its really amazing. Not only do they allow customers direct access to the worlds top class quantum computers, but they also allow customers to run programs that can simulate them in classical computers. This means that Companies won’t have to change drastically to get the benefits of QC. This isn’t a huge financial analysis or a deep dive into the company, however I believe that if you wish to get in on something revolutionary, now is the time with QUBT.

I was doing a stock screener for higher dividend stocks a few months ago and stumbled across SHLX, shell midstream partners. In a nutshell, they manage pipelines and other assets between refineries and extraction sites. When I found them, their dividend return was 16%, which I thought was just a temporary imbalance, but it appears that they have maintained the same rate all of last year, and have raised it every year prior to 2020. Am I missing something that is a red flag? I know that if you look at their price going back a few years it is on a downward trend, but since their decline in March 2020 they have been relatively stable. How are they able to pay such a high dividend? If it is a good value, is it just not well known? In the past, I have been lured to high dividend stocks that lowered their rate soon after I bought in, but after watching this for 3 months, their dividend yield has remained the same, and the share price has not been moving too much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Canadian investing novice Hey all,   
I've just started investing this month after having wanted to for many years. I guess the whole hype over stocks finally got me to put the time in to set things up and learn the jargon etc.   


I'm currently in Canada, so have set up a Wealthsimple account, though I'm from the UK originally and so have a Freetrade account for UK stocks (plus I might end up back in the UK eventually).   


Regarding trading in Canada, I went with setting up a Personal account but perhaps I chose wrongly? I have only been buying and only sold once for the first time yesterday however after I did so I was worried about the whole Day Trader title since it was a US stock and while Canada has no trading limits, if one trades US stocks (which does have limits) you could be flagged and delt with appropriately i.e. must have $25,000 in your account. I've sent an email to Wealthsimple about their views on this and if me buying and selling every so often is a big deal.  


I'm wondering if I should set up a TSFA account as well and just buy stocks which give dividends?  


If I understand correctly then a personal account is good for buying and selling in a short period whereas a TFSA is for buying and holding for years and for ones which pay out dividends?  


Finally, is there anything inherently wrong with having a UK and Canadian broker?

Let's say you are someone like me who scrolls through hoping to find that amazing DD that is going to be the next big thing and rocket you right to the moon... You think you're staying on top of things by reading the posts end-to-end and finding opportunities that really make sense. You get really excited about opportunities with awesome DD but for one glaring issue....timing.

The unfortunate reality is that this DD you found is only likely to get up-voted and become visible to you, after the stock has ALREADY popped. When the stock pops people get excited and they share it out...but it's always coming AFTER the pop. 

So, if your objective is to make a quick profit, you're setting yourself up for failure. Sure, you might get lucky, and you might still make a profit long-term, but your timing in the short-term will always be sub-optimal.

Now...I'm not knocking good DD as a way to find opportunities, but you should update your thinking and maybe taking the following steps instead of buying willy-nilly:

1. After you see some sexy DD, check if the stock is already spiking
2. If the stock is already spiking...then WATCH it...don't BUY it
3. Wait for a short-term dip and buy then if you are still bullish

I’m back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.  



**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


**MORE PROMISING NUMBERS**

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it’s STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.

https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Truth in lending language about interest charges when doing a short sale (margin) seems completely wrong. Thoughts? So I am converting a regular Merrill Lynch broker account into a margin account.  Opening today or tomorrow. Reason is I want to be able to (infrequently and conservatively) short the occasional stock. 

ML told me I would be charged interest on the amount of the “loan”, and that the subsequent value of security would not impact that loan balance that the interest is computed on.  That makes sense ($100 short sale, 50 is my cash and 50 on margin, my loan is 50 and interest charge on the 50 until I return the security). Obviously market value could cause a margin call or maintenance call, fine. But market value change would not impact the balance on which interest charged (makes sense). 

But oddly when I read the ML margin account opening disclosure agreement, it says this (in what I think is a cut and paste truth in lending section): 

“short sales

The market values of securities you sell “short” are adjusted daily for interest calculation purposes by a process called “marking to the market.” “Short sales against the box” are treated in exactly the same way as short sales.

The market value of all securities sold short in your account,including securities sold “short against the box,” are treated as a debit for the purpose of calculating interest charges. The closing market value of the securities that were sold short is determined each business day and is either added to the net debit balance or subtracted from the net credit balance in order to calculate interest charges.

If the total market value of the securities sold short increases, then the debit adjustment to the net balance will increase by the same amount for the calculation of interest charges. Conversely, if the total market value of the securities sold short decreases, then the debit adjustment to the net balance will also decrease by alike amount for the calculation of interest charges. The market value of “long”securities held in your account against which a short sale is made is not included in the computation of interest charges.”

Question: is this correct?  If not then Merrill Lynch really?  

Also, since it is in the agreement, I would argue that if the short stock went down, then customers should have been charged less interest per the above as drafted by ML. If went up and ML never followed their own language too late but if I was a ML customer who has been shorting I would ask for a refund for all in the money shorts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Global Payments - GPN DD Global payments released their earnings recently and it exceeded expectations by a large amount.

This post is the third installment of my technical analysis educational series and will serve as an introduction to moving averages. Please see my profile if you missed the prior installments on candle stick formations and horizontal support/resistance levels.

Moving averages provide the technical trader with reference points on an asset to help identify critical support/resistance levels and changes in trend. Furthermore, moving average analysis and how they interact with the price action of the asset and each other can become extremely nuanced. Depending on what type of trading I'm currently trying to do (scalping, swing trading, macro trend) I run up to 11 different moving averages at a time. Getting into the minutia of an entire trading system like that is well beyond the intended scope of this post, but I wanted to highlight the vast potential and adaptability of moving averages for the more serious traders out there. Lastly, discussing moving averages unavoidably gets into some "mathy" territory, which I tried to gloss over and explain as simply as possible. My apologies if anyone gets a glassy look in their eyes and has flashbacks to Junior year of High School.

**What is a Moving Average?**

A moving average is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages that becomes a moving/rolling mean. As the moving average "rolls forward" the old data is removed from the data set and the new price data is incorporated. For example, the 200 Day simple moving average is the average of the most recent 200 days of price action. As time moves forward the oldest data is removed from the moving average. One of the main benefits to move averages is that it smooths out the price action thereby reduces the impact of irregular or counter-trend price action.

**Moving Average Responsiveness**

Somewhat intuitively, the shorter the moving average the more responsive it will be to recent price action. For example, a 10 day moving average will be more significantly impacted by a sudden movement in the price of an asset in comparison to a 200 day moving average.

See this chart of NKE with a 10 exponential moving average (white line) and 200 exponential moving average (purple line) to understand this concept of moving average responsiveness: [https://imgur.com/gallery/snCrdjR](https://imgur.com/gallery/snCrdjR)

**EMA & SMA**

In addition to responsiveness to price action related to the period of moving average being utilized, there are also weighted calculations for certain types of moving averages.

Simple moving averages (sma's) are *unweighted* and are simply derived from the mean of the data points, such as the prior example of 200 day simple moving average being the average of the most recent 200 1 day candles.

Conversely, exponentially *weighted* moving averages (ema's) are calculated in a manner where the most recent price action is given more weight than the older data contained within the average. As a result, ema's are more responsive to recent changes in price in comparison to their sma counterparts.

For example, see this 1 day candle chart of NKE with the 200 ema (solid purple line) and 200 sma (crossed purple line) on it: [https://imgur.com/gallery/DEL7C8u](https://imgur.com/gallery/DEL7C8u)

Personally, I use a combo of ema's and sma's in my technical analysis because I find that the interaction of particular ema's and sma's can be quite useful.

**Support/Resistance Levels**

Moving averages are a great tool to use for identifying potential support/resistance areas and also to use for risk management. I will frequently pay particular attention to a moving average that also coincides with a horizontal support/resistance level.

For example, see this 1 day NKE chart where the price retraced and was bought up off the 100 ema and liquidity zone combo (see horizontal support/resistance post for more info on liquidity zones): [https://imgur.com/gallery/URThRg1](https://imgur.com/gallery/URThRg1)

**MACRO TREND ANALYSIS**

A simple rule of thumb is an asset is generally bullish if it is OVER its 1 month 21 ema and generally bearish if it UNDER its 1 month 21 ema.

See this 1 month chart of the S&P 500: [https://imgur.com/gallery/0xVVbag](https://imgur.com/gallery/0xVVbag)

**EMA/SMA Crosses**

The crossing of particular ema's and sma's are taken as significant shifts in trend and will often trigger significant reactions by algorithms and savvy technical traders. The rationale for this significance is that it gives a clear read on changes in trend. Frequently, price action will "wick" into the cross to test that the cross is being respected by the broader market. For a bullish cross you want to see price getting aggressively bought up off the moving average cross, and for a bearish cross you want price action to be rejected to the downside off the crossed moving averages. In addition, once theses moving averages crosses do occur, the pace at which the moving averages continue to diverge from each other, or squeeze back together, can provide clues on whether this new trend is strengthening.

Below are some of the most important and basic ema/sma crosses with examples and explanations:

**LIGHT BULL/BEAR CROSSES**

55 ema crossing OVER 21 ema ( light bearish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/IQ61FPE](https://imgur.com/gallery/IQ61FPE)

21 ema crossing UNDER 55 ema (light bullish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/dQbSBdW](https://imgur.com/gallery/dQbSBdW)

**EARLY WARNING SIGN CROSSES**

10 sma crossing UNDER 21 ema and 30 sma crossing OVER 21 ema (bearish - early warning sign): [https://imgur.com/gallery/Lm7OYyJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Lm7OYyJ)

10 sma crossing OVER and 30 sma crossing UNDER 21 ema (bullish - early warning sign): [https://imgur.com/gallery/EimNDB9](https://imgur.com/gallery/EimNDB9)

**MAJOR CROSSES - DEATH CROSS/GOLDEN CROSS**

Death Crosses and Golden Crosses are often considered "major events" on an asset by technical analysts. Similar to analyzing candle structure, the higher the time frame the crosses occur on (1d candles, 3d candles, 1 w candles) the more significant those crosses will be for establishing trend. A golden cross or death cross on a 3d or 1w time frame can set the trend for an equity for a period of months and sometimes years.

55 ema crossing UNDER 200 ema ("Death Cross" - strong bearish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/WYDtmPq](https://imgur.com/gallery/WYDtmPq)

55 ema crossing OVER 200 ema ("Golden Cross" - strong bullish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/TSglHe8](https://imgur.com/gallery/TSglHe8)

**Potential EMA's and SMA's to run:**

Below are some of my preferred moving averages. You will notice that I sometimes slightly alter certain moving averages to suit current market conditions.

**EMA's**

1. 9/10 ema
2. 20/21 ema
3. 50/55 ema
4. 89/100 ema
5. 200 ema
6. 377 ema

**SMA's**

1. 10 sma
2. 30 sma
3. 50 sma
4. 100/128 sma
5. 200 sma

I know Cathie and the ARK team are very active and constantly re-balance their ETFs. So I would think, they have the tools and knowledge to re-balance accordingly if valuations get insanely high.

I put about $2,500 into the market last March when everything was tanking.  I bought about 30 companies across as many sectors as I could find.  My main goal was to educate myself about the market and try to learn something.  I didn't really expect to get much out of it and expected to lose some or all of what I put in.  Right now, I'm sitting at $7,850, so more than triple what I put in and all but one of my picks has at least some positive upside.  Here's the thing (and what I don't really get about stocks in general) if I'm looking at the market as a savings account, I guess I would just leave the money out there.  But I could also take my chips off the table and be happy with my \~$5000 profit.  Sure the market could continue to go up, but it could also crash.  If it goes up, I still could benefit from my original $2500 being left in and if it crashes I can invest even more now and hopefully replicate the above.  Either way, it is important to note that I don't actually need this money for anything.  The $2500 and the $5000 I've made aren't needed for bills or credit card debt, or anything else.  I just don't see why I would risk essentially free money.

But then, when I look at the volume, including extended hours, the volume of shares being moved is massive. That makes me wonder if it’s actually a bad time to jump in, the thought being that people are going to want to recognize their big gains and there be a huge sell off and the stock prices crash and come back down to earth.

So essentially *List highly exaggerated positives with no negatives at all*
I'm now going to go onto my alt account and make a few similar posts whilst gilding them so everyone knows it's the truth. Once the bots upvote it further everyone will jump in pumping my stock up. I've cross posted it to wallstreetbets so it will get even more traction. 

Anyone else feel like this is how 9/10 DD posts are on this subreddit now? They are just pumping stocks over and over. Honestly, think we have just become wallstreetbets second subreddit because half our DDs come directly from there and we are getting less discussion on earnings etc and more on how BB/GME etc are going to become the next Microsoft by the end of the year.

Edit: Added rocket emojis and Diamonds so the bots know to upvote my post because any stock with rocket emojis will go up a huge amount simply because I added two emojis.

Edit 2: STOCK GOING MOON. BUY THE DIP. The stock must go up simply because I typed that.

Edit 3: Look at that GME post with hundreds of awards. Normal for a none pumping post right?

Edit 4: DD stands for due diligence or currently it stands for "Buy the stock I'm pumping and be a bag holder later on"

Specifically,  **APHA Feb 12 2021 25 Call (Weekly)**  @ 0.75, which is not 1.60 pre-market, which I'm sure is going to go up even higher now that APHA is sitting on another 25% gain pre-market......

&#x200B;

The question is, do I buy back the calls, or just get rid of APHA at $25 ? I bought in at 8, so I'm still making over 200%, however, now it's around $30 bucks.

Just wanted to get your thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are High-Dividend ETFs a good investment for me at 23 years old? (SDIV and SDEM) Hello, guys. I am 23 years old with around 10-11k in savings right now. I am reading a lot about passive income because I have some short term goals I would love to see fulfilled in the next few months or years. One of the things I came across was high-dividend ETFs, where the stocks are already diversified, so I wouldn't need to scramble to make and meticulously observe my own custom portfolio. It generally follows the S&P, although the bounceback hasn't been quite as high as the S&P since the pandemic plummet. But, the SDIV has a dividend yield of around 10.77%.

My savings account has a very low interest rate, like less than 1%, and I'd love to move the money somewhere else with a higher yield. My thought process is, if I can put my 10k in a portfolio of high-dividend stocks or a high yield ETF, and add $400-500 to it every month, my dividend yield amount will compound along with my personal contributions, and it will build up quite quickly. I'd go from $80 a month to $100 a month in just 4 months. And it would keep on building from my understanding.

The SDIV has also been around since 2011, I don't think it's going to go anywhere. I'd want to do more due diligence, but is this a good plan overall if the SDIV checks out in terms of sustainability?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (2/10) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News #Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub!

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing

> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18.

It is really all about understanding that everything should start from the notion of information.

It's easy to get greedy looking at huge price movement on the way up (wish I went long) or on the way down (wish I went short) but the reality is that extreme price movements mimic a randomness casino with no reason or ryme

One should focus on finding something one is absolutely sure or has a high degree of confidence and assume position with leverage. It mimics the epic price movements without the randomness

Now I've been trying to understand the types of index based funds (Indeces vs Mutual Funds vs Index Funds vs ETFs ...) and their differences but I still don't get why prices between those types differ.

For example:
- S&P 500 Index = 3.911,23 $
- Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF = 61,45 €

What makes up the index price? What makes up the ETF price? Do they follow the exact same trend?

Another example (for which I initially decided to do the research):

EMQQ (Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce)
- ETF on NYSEARC: 77,53 $ (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EMQQ?p=EMQQ&.tsrc=fin-srch)
- ETF on MIL: 18,64 €
(https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EMQQ.MI?p=EMQQ.MI&.tsrc=fin-srch)

What is the difference between those two ETF's and why do their prices differ so much? (aside from currency ofcourse)

As a Belgian, would it be better to invest in € ETF or $ ETF?

I've got an APHA July 16 $35 call that I bought for $1.90 which closed yesterday at $7.05. If the pre-market run up holds, then it will be worth even more. I don't want to lose all this profit but at the same time feel that this pot stock run is really just beginning and the expiry still has loads of time. So rather than sell, how can use protective puts to do this?

My problem is that I don't know which put to choose. If I choose one that is too cheap and far OTM then it won't gain whatever my call loses in the event of a decline.

I also wrote a post about a penny stock that I cannot mention here, but went up 140% at the time of writing. Check my profile if you're interested in that. I think I have another winner on my hands: EXPI

EXPI might genuinely be the AMZN of housing. They are a real estate company that works WITH realtors so that they can buy and sell their houses. In exchange, they get a commission for helping secure the sell. Right now, they’re worth $11 billion. Their YoY growth was 99.9%, absolutely crushing Zillow’s pathetic returns. Yet Z is worth 4 times EXPI's current evaluation, at 40 billion. That’s right, EXPI is less expensive AND it is growing faster. The only thing that Z has is [revenue](https://i.imgur.com/Ok2CRoU.jpg), but if EXPI continues at its current rate, or even halves, it will still be making more than Zillow.

If you’re bullish on the housing market. EXPI is a must hold. Sure, they gained 1000%. They went from penny stock levels to small to mid-cap levels in a year. This thing will be worth over $40 billion as soon as they pass Zillow. But why stop there? They’re growing absolutely astronomically. DOUBLING their revenue is completely insane for a $10 billion company.

I’ve recently come across a company that I really believe is a diamond in the rough. 

Ocean Power Technologies (Nasdaq:OPTT) is a pioneer in renewable wave-energy technology that converts ocean wave energy into electricity. OPT's proprietary PowerBuoy® technology is based on a modular design and has undergone periodic ocean testing since 1997. OPT specializes in advanced autonomous (not grid connected), cost-effective, and environmentally sound ocean wave based power generation and management technology.

The PowerBuoy system integrates patented technologies in hydrodynamics, electronics, energy conversion, and computer control systems to extract the natural energy in ocean waves. The result is a leading edge, ocean-tested, proprietary autonomous system that turns wave power into reliable, clean, and environmentally beneficial electricity for offshore applications.

OPT just recently released a new surveillance system powered through the PowerBuoy. A single OPT Surface Surveillance Solution can monitor more than 1600 square miles of ocean surface on a permanent or temporary basis, with the ability to seamlessly link multiple surveillance assets together over large ocean areas giving end-users visibility into potentially damaging environmental or illegal activities. Customized solutions are also available including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures, tsunami activity, and water quality.

OPT’s Surface Surveillance Solution payload consists of a high definition radar, gyro-stabilized high definition optical and thermal imaging cameras, vessel automatic identification system (AIS) detection, and integrated command and control software, paired with OPT’s autonomous PB3 PowerBuoy or hybrid PowerBuoy as a power and communications platform. Capabilities include 24/7 vessel tracking – including “black ships” which do not broadcast an AIS signal – automatic radar plotting and vessel warnings, and high definition optical and thermal video surveillance which can be used as evidence to aid in prosecution.

I feel there is a lot of growth potential for this stock, they are setting themselves up to be not only a renewable energy source but also a government asset with their high tech surveillance system.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc and the New York Stock Exchange have each sued the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to block a plan by the regulator to overhaul public data feeds that broadcast stock prices to investors, court filings show.

Under the SEC plan, approved in December, supply and demand data for stocks would be added to public feeds, broadening access to the information which the exchanges currently sell to professional traders at a premium.

“Nasdaq believes the SEC exceeded its authority by adopting an ill-considered remake of market structure,” a Nasdaq spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. The plan “would make equity markets overly complex and increase hidden costs for investors”, the statement said.

The filings were made in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Cboe Global Markets, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was also suing the SEC over the issue. Cboe did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action taken by the exchanges against the SEC in recent years, which include a successful challenge to a proposed experiment by the SEC to cap trading fees on 1,400 different stocks.

The SEC is also dealing with other suits. In October, Citadel Securities sued the commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at exchange operator IEX Group Inc.

Hi, i'm new to personal finance and i'm doing some research on how to invest money.

i  came across multiple websites explaining the "magic" of compound  interest, which i did understand from a mathematical point of view.

then  they take as example s&p500 because it has average return of  10%/year for over 40 years, and they then apply coumpond interest to an  hypotetical investment you made on it 30 or 20 years ago and they come  up with a big number.

The problem i  found is that this is just not true, compound mathematically only works  if EVERY year the return is positive, not if the average is.

This is a ideal vs real world  example i examinated:

IDEAL  COMPOUND: you start with 1000$ and on that you get 10% return for 30  years, this way you actually use the magic of compound and you end up  with 17449$ after 30 years

REAL  LIFE: IF you invested those 1000$ on S&P 30 years ago and hold it.  after 30 years (1990-2020) your 1000$ are worth only 9057$  (half of a  ideal compound)

Despite S&P **averaging** **10%** each year you can see that the difference is pretty big compared to

a **real 10%** each year, and the difference grow exponentially if instead of 30 years you use more years.

to  calculate the real life numbers i used this link that report the return  of S&P EACH YEAR and i used the time frame of 1990 to 2020. [https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)

Unless  i'm missing something, compound interest works magic in the ideal math  world, but just doesnt apply to real world, even to a classic S&P500  which has the most stable avrg annual return.

so why everybody keep talking about compond like it does apply to real life?

if i am wrong please correct me, as i said i'm new and this thing really doesnt make sense to me.

But given the [mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants) and booster vaccine development in full steam, I think covid 19 revenue are very likely to extend beyond this year. [UK authorities are already laying out plans](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) for annual vaccination. In such scenario, NVAX is actually better placed than Moderna.

So Q2 2020 onwards, I dont see NVAX revenue to be lower than Moderna. Market is already beginning to realize that. I expect its market cap to come inline.

I believe most people are likely to go for Novavax when it comes to next jab because:

1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)
2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)
4.

5. And obviously [highest efficacy (95.6% original, 86% UK, 60% SA strain)](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3).

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116**

It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.

What Wall Street expects
Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect GM to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 on revenue of $36.12 billion, on average. ("Adjusted" earnings exclude one-time items.) 

How GM performed in the fourth quarter of 2020

GM's U.S. sales were very strong in the fourth quarter, up 5% from a year ago despite weak commercial fleet sales. Put another way, GM's higher-margin retail sales were very strong. A key factor: Sales of GM's new full-size pickups were up 11%, as GM's dealers took advantage of rival Ford Motor Company's tight pickup inventories amid a changeover to an all-new 2021 F-150. 

Also helping: U.S. sales of GM's brand-new big SUVs -- the Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban, and GMC Yukon -- were up a combined 28% year over year. 

GM also did well in China: Sales rose 14.1% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, driven by strong sales of new SUVs at Cadillac (up 56%) and Buick (up 28%).

To quote the post linked above:
>Exelixis is a company that makes genomics-based drugs for cancer. They already have an approved anti-cancer drug, Cometriq. The company is currently involved in 50 clinical trials and currently has four other anti-cancer therapies in the pipeline. The company has years of experience in the field and is listed on the S&P 400. If research in genetic engineering increases in the coming years, you have a company that is well positioned in this field.

The company is in the black given the success of the existing drugs they have on the market (Cabometyx and Cometriq), with other drugs in the pipeline. In January the FDA approved Cabometyx in combination with a drug made by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo) for the treatment of kidney cancer.

EXEL has solid looking financials since at least 2017, consistently making profit and with good cash flow. Stock closed at around $23 yesterday which is where it seems to have mostly been for the last 30 days (with one dip to $21 in January). Institutional ownership looks to be around 85%. From my limited experience and understanding this company looks pretty stable with a good outlook, but given their results for the last quarter I think the results they're announcing for 2020 today won't be as strong as previous years due to the impact Covid had on their business. With vaccine rollouts underway I think it's reasonable to expect the company to bounce back in 2021.

Overall I'm increasingly of the mind that $20-$25 per share is a pretty good price to buy in at but that it's probably sensible to wait to buy until Thursday after the financial results have been published.

My question is, which one to buy based on the merger deal? If I understand it correctly, APHA's investors will own about 64% of the combined stocks, and looking at the market cap of the companies, they're both at roughly the same level.

My reasoning is that if theoretically the market caps  (of the two companies) were the same, and APHA's shares would account for 64% of the combined total, then it would be better to buy APHA, right?

Any idea?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Short Interest Take 2 So I have seen a lot of posts about how the GME Short Interest disparity means that there is something nefarious going on and that it is a sign that the institution is weak and we need to take action and moon GME. I am going to explain it as simply as I understand it, but note I am not an expert.  
&nbsp;

It appears that every site has a consistent number of GME shares that are shorted (roughly speaking) which is 21 million shares. The mix-up seems to be that some sites calculate the float differently than others do. If you had been saying/hearing that GME had been 120% shorted before this report then you fall into the camp who has sites that would read out 42% short interest now. If you had been saying/hearing that GME had been 226% shorted before this report, then you were getting information from sites that would read out 78% now.  
&nbsp;

The difference in float size has to do with some sites only removing insider holdings from the outstanding shares while other sites try to estimate other shares that may be untradeable and remove them from the float. The important thing to remember is that you compare like with like. The net short interest is now only about 1/3 of what it was in the last report. Do with this information what you will.  
&nbsp;

TLDR: Short interest is different because of different float calculations. Short shares are the same and are only 1/3 what they were before. Credit to u/meta-cognizant for helping clarify._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The $TLRY Gamma Squeeze is HERE! Numbers plus $APHA discussion TLDR: The gamma squeeze we previously saw in $GME is starting to happen in $TLRY. The price of TLRY has skyrocketed so high that all the call options the Market Makers wrote are forcing them to buy and hold shares to hedge against uncapped losses. Between the Market Makers and the Shorts, there are less and less shares available. My guess is that the price of TLRY will continue to skyrocket until next week, at a minimum.

CONGRATS fellow TLRY/APHA holders! I strongly believe we are witnessing a huge gamma squeeze underway. Today, the price of TLRY rose above the highest strike prices on the options chain ($42), which means all the available call options are in-the-money. Market Makers released new strike prices from $45 to $65. FYI: some brokers do not show the new strike prices ($45/50/55/60/65) right away because they are scumbags.

*How can we tell this is a gamma squeeze?*

Take a look at the TODAY's call options volume for Feb 12 expiration (this Friday):

* 30,633 at the $40 strike calls
* 6,810 at the $41 strike calls
* 62,786 at he $42 strike calls

That is nearly 100,000 call options. If you add up the call volume from $30 to $42 strikes, you get over 150,000 call options traded today! Open interest was much lower than volume, which tells me these are new call positions being opened.

150,000 call options x 100 shares per call option = 15 MILLION TLRY shares that Market Makers have to buy on the open market and hold until all the contracts are resolved next week. This is only for today's volume, WE STILL HAVE 2 MORE TRADING DAYS TO GO!

To add fuel to the fire, TLRY has a significant amount of short interest and low shares float (shares that are available for trading, not locked up with institutions or insiders):

* TLRY shares float: **\~95M** / short interest: **\~32M** / today's MM hedge: \~**15M**

Let's get this straight, what we are seeing today is **not 100% a short squeeze.** This is *mostly* a gamma squeeze. However, the gamma squeeze and high short interest has an amplifying effect on each other. Market makers and shorts both have to bid against each other to buy shares on the open market, causing the price to skyrocket even higher!

For APHA holders, we should see new strike prices released tomorrow, because APHA is trading at $27 afterhours which is above the highest $25 strike. Theoretically, we could see a gamma squeeze on APHA, but I think the chance of that happening is very very low. *Why?*

APHA has a LOT more shares float (shares available to trade) and much lower short interest:

* APHA shares float: **\~312M** / short interest: **\~16M /** today's MM hedge: **maybe 5M**

That is a ton of shares available for the Market Makers to tap into, and far less shorts to fight against. You would need something like 500k or more call option volume to apply enough pressure on MM to cause a gamma squeeze. I think a true **APHA gamma squeeze is very unlikely**.

The good news for my APHA holders is that you will probably see APHA trade up with TLRY due to the pending merger, but at a steep discount (40% or more). Lots of posts/comments are raving about the huge arbitrage opportunity, but that is not realistic until a merger date is set and we get close to that date. Plus, you will need to hold your shares until the merger, which nobody really knows how long that could take.

Lastly, This is a gamma squeeze play in the short term. Realize that once the gamma squeeze is over, the trade is over and you need to get out! I will add that I love the TLRY+APHA merger, and love the fundamentals of the company. I believe they are a long term winner with multiple tailwinds in the US and Europe. I might do another FA post with DD, but right now my priority is this gamma squeeze.

Best of luck to you all!

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say "it" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, "it", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including "synthetic longs" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a "what-if" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many "what-if's" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. "It's two weeks old". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) "The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity."

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/25 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the "dying brick and mortar" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes "just happen". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), was at the time "inevitable" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Beginning of April), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from "get over it, the squeeze happened" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

My first ever stock purchase, and why I love it. So, I know this gain is nothing compared to others on here, but my day was made today. When I first got into the stock market 3 months back, this was the first stock I ever bought and I made it about 25% of my portfolio after researching it ($5k initial investment). My average cost was $6.80. In December, when they came out with good news from their Phase II trials it went up which was exciting, and hovered around $8-$10. Today as soon as the news of their successful stage- 3 clinical trial cure for bone/blood cancers released with overwhelmingly positive results it LEAPED after hours! I'm now up approximately 150% on GMDA (Over $6,600 gain today alone). I think I saw it as high as $18.15 post-presentation and has consolidated around $16.60 range. I do believe we'll see another run at market open tomorrow based on the news. It was a stock I felt good about investing in initially, and it's awesome to see 150%+ gains from your first ever stock pick. This stock helped push my entire portfolio to 55% gains overall in a little under 3 months.

For those who don't know what Gamida Cell ($GMDA) is, they are an advanced Israeli-based cell therapy company committed to cures for patients with blood cancers and serious blood diseases.

Their main focus is Omidubicel, an advanced cell therapy under development as a potential life-saving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant solution for patients with hematologic malignancies (blood cancers). With Omidubicel, it results in faster recovery, fewer infections, and fewer days in the hospital, and increased survival than the standard umbilical cord blood transplantation that's currently in use in the medical system. Omidubicel should be considered the new standard of care for patients eligible for the umbilical cord blood transplantation if they get FDA approval (which I think they will).

Even with this recent leap in price, I think it still has a LONG way to run. The clinical data results will form the basis of a Biologics License Application (BLA) that Gamida Cell expects to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2021. If it works out, they could be one of the first blood cancer-curing companies to be FDA approved which would be HUGE! If they get FDA approval this year it's going to run even more. I still don't think it's too late to jump in on this stock. Cathy Wood has even added a lot of it to ARK.

Now I'm a bit of both individual stock picker and index fund person both. I'm wondering which option is better for my tax free account vs taxable account. This is not a pension account. That's separate.

Choosing ETFs in Tax-free account :

Pros : Dollar cost average regularly and forget about it for couple of years. Any dividends not taxed either.

Can offset bad picks in stocks with IT returns atleast.



Choosing Individual stock picks in tax-free account:

Pros : Better picks like MSFT,AAPL will best ETF gains and no taxes. Can take gains from a particular stock easily if I feel it's been overbought.

Cons : Some stocks will lose money (bad or overpriced picks, takes time to recover after correction), so cannot rebalance without realizing loss.

Have to keep rebalancing stock picks over time which means buying/selling fees (not to forget any Forex conversions)

Also, I cannot trade any derivatives on the tax free account.

After writing it down, it seems both options aren't that too different, but I get this hollow feeling that I will buy/sell more stocks (and try to time market and profit gains) if I used tax free account for shares only.

But what exactly are the implications of Tesla being the first? They have factories that are built to double and triple in size if necessary.  So I'm guessing they'll be able to churn out "robo-taxis" in the not-so-distant future... But what else would Tesla be able to create that would justify their current valuation aside from cars and taxis?

I want to apologize now for what I anticipate will be a relatively long post; I tend to ramble a lot haha. I’ll be sure to include a TLDR at the end for those that would like a quick summary.

I first got into investing around a week and a half ago during the $GME situation, but I was too skeptical about it and too poor to buy into $GME specifically. To play it safe, I bought two AMC shares in case they took off like people were saying they would, but I also invested in some companies that I thought had potential since I’ve always been interested in the  stock market, and a basic rule of thumb is “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” One of the companies I invested in was $APHA for 2 shares at $14.40. My main thought process was a mixture of combining something that I enjoy with the idea “invest in legal weed before it gets legalized, then hopefully it’ll happen soon and the prices will go way up.” 

Flash forward to the present; I’ve invested a total of $65, and my entire portfolio is worth $99.95 with a huge chunk of my profit being tied to Aphria; the price is currently sitting at $27.70 for a share, so they’ve nearly doubled since I first got them! I’m very happy with this, but now the part where I’d like some advice: I don’t know whether my original thought process is flawed. I understand that the stock market always fluctuates and nothing is certain, but assuming things stay relatively non-apocalyptic, is the idea that weed shares will go up in price after federal legalization?

I haven’t done a whole lot of research on the industry as a whole, but I remember reading headlines about how the cannabis industry tends to be very profitable when implemented at state levels, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t be profitable once implemented nationwide.

If you’ve read this far, I sincerely thank you, and I welcome any advice you have for a new investor :)

TLDR: Is the thought process “Invest in legal weed now with the hopes that it gets legalized soon and share prices go up” logical?

Edited to make it flow nicer_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trying to make sense of $QS Hello all,

I have dabbled in investing in stocks with minimal amounts of money for short times in the past, but I've decided to try and make a concerted effort to invest with a long-term plan and goals in mind. I am very much an amateur and I am trying to do my best to make informed decisions with the stocks I invest in.

I am very interested in the EV sector and reviewing some of the stocks associated with this area I came across QuantumScape. Essentially they were founded in 2012 and have been invested in by both Bill Gates and Volkswagen. They are working on developing a solid-state battery for electric vehicles, in contrast to the current conventional lithium batteries in use. However, I've come across recent articles with completely contrasting outlooks on the feasibility of their batteries.

One analyst contends that QuantumScape's battery (assuming they are able to scale it to an EV vehicle and mass produce) has already proved it solves many of the problems of current batteries including 1) Charging quickly 2) Battery longevity 3) Work across entire automotive temperature & 4) Minimizing excess lithium. The analyst notes that their performance data shows that their cells meet all of these requirements, positioning themselves as the first in the market to achieve such feats. It should also be noted that in the article that analyst states the development of these batteries will lead to a lower cost. (I initially linked this section with a SeekingAlpha article, my initial post was removed for this reason so I guess they are not a reputable source lol)

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I have read articles that appropriately discuss the risks the company faces including how their batteries have not been tested outside of a laboratory, will cost too much, and they won't be pushing anything to market until at least 2024.

I am expecting the price of the stock to steadily drop as long as the company isn't able to produce any marketable batteries in the short-term, but please correct me if this assumption is unwarranted.

Cheers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Correction Warning Sign I was taking a look at the [largest ever daily drops in the DOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) and realized that of the top 20 biggest daily drops in the past 80 years only one of them didn't precede a larger overall market correction/crash.  That only outlier was when the markets reopened after 9/11.

Why is this valuable information? If you're a short-term trader or looking to cash out in the next few years it might be smart to sell off a chunk of your investments if there's a single day drop of more than 6-7%.

I just want to try this out by leaving the $20k in those 2 funds for a couple years. 

Any thoughts on how risky this is? Is this even risky?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where would you put $150k-200k for short term (two years)? My long term growth portfolio and my retirement accounts are healthy, and I’ll continue to contribute to them, but I have some money 
I inherited last year that I can afford to be moderately/significantly risky with, in effort to maximize short term growth in hopes of reaching my goal of building my dream cottage out in the country. 

I don’t have an exact timeline, but I think about two years is what I’m looking at. 

If shortish term growth was your only goal, and you were wanting to take on moderate/significant risk, where would you put 150-200k?

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tilray/Apha merger Hey guys, this is going to sound like a dumb Q.  Apha/Tilray are merging sometime I think April/May (I can't find the exact date).  My understanding is when the merger happens Apha shares will be worth 83% of Tilrays.  The spread right now is 62%.  I own both.

I Invest in this etf and it’s done good for me. But when I first did a couple months ago I’m pretty sure it didn’t have that in it especially not that high. Just seems really weird I’ve never seen any etf 1. With a 34 percent holding and 2. Definitely not a liquidity treasure very high if at all.

Hi everyone & thanks in advance for reading,

I, like a lot of people on here, opened a brokerage account once lockdown started turning into cabin fever. I've been into finance for a while, but am quite anxious about losing money, and so I've only contributed $4500 since I started trading ($2500 last June & another $2k in Dec). I've been able to turn that into $11.5k as of writing, but I still feel as though I'm not performing as well as I could.

The way I do things in terms of risk is in an interesting place; when I go in on something, it's exclusively throwing my whole portfolio at a single stock and watching it like a hawk. However, I've never overheld/sold passed the peak. What typically happens for me, is that I'll take a 15-20% return (usually on the same day or 1-2 days after going in) and think "this is absurd, there's no way this keeps up" and hop out. I spend a good deal of time on Reddit forums, so I've traded things like PLTR, WKHS, yes GME, & now APHA. I can articulate why, for example, APHA is still a good hold & should continue to climb until the merger with TLRY/there's a huge arbitrage gap, but I consistently cut out once I've made a gain...only to get back in with a higher cost basis.

I like to think that I'm reducing my downside potential by paper-handing everything (I often leave a trade if the stock drops \~3-5% from my buy-in), but I'm also massively diminishing upside as well (ex held GME through most of 45-130 & never went back). Are there any mental tricks or techniques you guys would recommend to help me bite the bullet and commit to trades? I suppose I could set a stop loss each day, but beyond this, is it just forcing myself to not look at my phone & believing in the thesis?

Thanks a bunch for any guidance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it worth getting back in on Tilray?

Back in March last year when Tesla was at its lowest I bought 1 share for £300 and now it’s worth around 3k or so.

I’m conflicted on what I should do, should I continue to hold or sell it and invest in something else?

Part of me thinks I should because that money is just not doing anything anymore, but I also don’t want to be the guy in 20 years who sold his Tesla shares which would be worth 100x more by that time.

I’m not looking for real financial advice, just advice on what you would personally do in a situation like this.

Looking forward to seeing what you guys think!

Edit: Thanks for the advice guys!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Tesla still a good investment? I've been invested since late 2019. The thing that drew me to it was the fact that it it's more like a cult than a company. This is one of the factors that drove Apple's success and made it what it is today. I know there's the whole P/E ratio thing but I really can't name too many other companies that have so many passionate customers that just love the product and everything with the brand in it. I think this is one of those things that will drive the valuation of the company to be where the stock is at. However, there have recently been some things that have made me more leery as this thing that's going on in China with regulators not being too happy with the end [product](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html) .

I'm used to all of this rollercoaster and Musk's antics but yet something in my gut just tells me all of this really isn't going to go well this time. I still believe in the company as 1) it's not just a car company 2) retains it's cult status regardless and 3)still seems to have first mover advantage in many areas.

Ticker: Ford (F)
Current share price: $11.94
Strike price: $1.5
Break even: $12.78 (+7.12%)
Contract price: ($11.28x100)=$1128
Expires: This Friday 

So am I correct that I get to keep the premium of $1128 no matter what the price does after I sell the calls? 

Then if they exercise they also have to pay me ($1.5x100)=$150 for the 100 shares on top of that? 

So worst case scenario I lose all of my shares for $1128+$150=$1278?

And best case scenario I make $1128 and keep my 100 shares? 

And those are the only two scenarios?

And again most importantly I keep the premium no matter what?

Ok, so I've been seeing this **ortex**(https://www.ortex.com/symbol/NYSE/GME/short_interest) or **imgur**(https://m.imgur.com/gallery/UmWimoD) link and let's assume it's as accurate as it's been reported. They're saying that from the reports previous to the 15th, shorts have only moved and covered **10M** shares. However from the 15-29th they managed to cover **40M** shares; not counting stock holders like me and all the crazy buying that happened.

There are **70M** shares for GME, and according to FINRA, the top 10 funds have **23.6M**. Add Cohen's **9M** shares that brings us to **32M** shares. We're not even counting other board members here who I'm sure have at least **1M** shares each.

That leaves **38M** shares for us and the shorts to buy? There is still **21.4M** shorts as of the report on the 29th. I don't understand how unless the funds/cohen/other board members sold their shares to return it back to them? Or lent it to cover the shorts, but that in turn would just add more shorts?

I'm so confused. Is there something I'm missing regarding the math?

Just to give a bit of background for those not aware, both TLRY and APHA announced a merger on 18th of December  to create the biggest leagal marijuana companyb in Canada. Since the news of the merger there has been a lot of positive news with the company, mainly their approval to trade in UK. As such both these stocks have gained a lot of momentum lately.

My confusion is to do with part of the agreement of the merger. It was announced in December that all APHA shareholders will recieve 0.84 share of TLRY onece the merger is complete. However the current prices of APHA and TLRY are not in sync. APHA is trading at $23.75 usd and  TLRY is at 42.35. If someone wants to buy TLDR now for long term hold, wouldn't it make sense to buy APHA instead, as following the merger if we take today's prices for example, the same $23.45 shares are equivalent to $35.57 (84% current TLRY price)?
