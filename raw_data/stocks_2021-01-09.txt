 Why Vale SA is a buy If we all look at the EVs industry we’ll see that one stock in particular boomed and recently reached a milestone of $880, I am talking about Tesla. Measuring the stock’s growth last year from January to December, Tesla was initially valued at $88,60. However, at the end of the year it was valued at $705,67. 

Relative change (Jan 3 - Dec 31): ($705,67 - $88,60) / $88,60 x 100 ≈ 700% increase in the year of 2020. It ended up being worth 7x its initial worth.

In order for Tesla to produce more cars in the upcoming years, they demand **sustainable nickel**. Elon Musk has said that Tesla has had shortages of nickel.

Which company mines the most nickel?

That is Vale SA, on the year of 2019 they mined 208,000 metric tonnes and outperformed Nornickel by ≈ 43.000 metric tonnes. 
Tesla might not be keen to cooperate with Nornickel in the future due to the ongoing oil spill crisis in Norilsk and also because Nornickel has shown that it isn’t sustainable. Nornickel was able to prevent the oil spill if they had followed orders from Rostekhnadzor (governmental supervisor). Nornickel is fully responsible for the oil spill and are due to pay 1.5B US dollars.

There has been discussions between Tesla and Vale SA, there’s a huge possibility that there will be a cooperation between them. The Vale SA stock has been increasing consistently since February 2016.

I am invested into Vale SA, and I think that you should be too, it has such huge potential.
Tell me what you think of Vale SA and also list five to ten stocks you’re interested in and why.

I'm a bit confused on this battery announcement and I wonder on how much is just MARKETING....

Just yesterday I have heard  Erik Desaulniers CEO of  nouveau monde graphite saying he's not scared from solid state batteries as it's a thing that is not due to happened anytime soon.

He basically compares that lithium ion batteries is a old tech with over 30 years old, but only in the last decade companies started to build giga factories to mass produce this tech and lower its cost. 

So if solid state battery is happening and there's a big run to see who gets it out first... 

 In this interview he sheds some light on prices of mining materials, giving the example that solid state batteries need lithium metal and only 2k ton are produced today in the world with a price of 50k usd per ton. 

That means price per KW/h is just too expensive. 

Isn't that just unsustainable to do it right now? he says maybe in 15/20years but it's something that would be more plausible to use on rocket ships and jets  than cars for now. 

Then nio announces one today for end of 2022?

Set yourselves up for retirement at 35 years old haha. 

To the people who keep asking if it’s a bubble or if they should sell because they only really bandwagoned into Tesla cause of FOMO and their desire to get rich quickly, consider these:

1) If you are happy with the profit that you’ve made, sell and never look back. Nobody ever lost by taking a profit.

2) If you are especially worried about a “Tesla    bubble” and are freaking out about losing what gains you’ve  already made, just sell and put your mind at ease. No sense in going crazy over it. People have lost money for being too greedy.

3) Next time, actually do your DD instead of just buying a company cause you see the stock price skyrocketing. 10Qs, 10Ks, Earnings calls, news articles, etc. are available to current and potential shareholders for a reason so use them and judge for yourself whether the company will generate an adequate future free cash flow to justify current valuation (aka form a thesis on the company).

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021. It's Total Addressable Market is 300B. \[2\]\[5\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries. It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen. ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\]\[6\]. This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now. The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery. What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery; or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings. Picture the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge. Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note: blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel. green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\]. Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells). They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\]. So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035. Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery. And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

Avg price 41.50_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why We Are at the Major Late-Stage Bubble, Possibly the Biggest in History Before I begin, I came across this article written by Jeremey Grantham, who is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, also regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor particularly due to his prediction of various historic stock market bubbles.

In his article titled "Waiting for the Last Dance", he outlines multiple points why he thinks we are in a major late-stage bubble. I will summarize below the key points discussed, but will also leave a link to the article in case you want to read the full version.

[https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)

\- The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, and he believes this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.

\- The single most dependable feature of the late stages of the great bubbles of history has been really crazy investor behaviour, especially on the part of individuals. For the first 10 years of this bull market, we lacked such wild speculation. But now we have it. (he provides examples such as Hertz, K\*d\*k, Nikola, and especially, Tesla)

\- The "Buffett indicator," total stock market capitalization to GDP, broke through its all-time-high 2000 record. In 2020, there were 480 IPOs (including an incredible 248 SPACs) – more new listings than the 406 IPOs in 2000. There are 150 non-micro-cap companies (market cap of over $250 million) that have more than tripled in the year, which is over 3 times as many as any year in the previous decade. The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.

\- This time, more than in any previous bubble, investors are relying on accommodative monetary conditions and zero real rates extrapolated indefinitely ... Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%!

\-Nothing in investing perfectly repeats. Certainly not investment bubbles. Each form of irrational exuberance is different; we are just looking for what you might call spiritual similarities. Even now, I know that this market can soar upwards for a few more weeks or even months – it feels like we could be anywhere between July 1999 and February 2000. Which is to say it is entitled to break any day, having checked all the boxes, but could keep roaring upwards for a few months longer.

\- My best guess as to the longest this bubble might survive is the late spring or early summer, coinciding with the broad rollout of the COVID vaccine. At that moment, the most pressing issue facing the world economy will have been solved. Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realize that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the COVID crisis, and valuations are absurd. “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” But remember that timing the bursting of bubbles has a long history of disappointment.

\- Even with hindsight, it is seldom easy to point to the pin that burst the bubble. The main reason for this lack of clarity is that the great bull markets did not break when they were presented with a major unexpected negative. The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday. And that is why they are always missed.

\-The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.

If you are interested to see more of his arguments, I strongly advise you to go and read the full article. I am currently 100% on equities, and very bullish for stocks as all of you probably are. But I think it's also important to have a balanced perspective, especially when everyone around you is extremely bullish. Ultimately, we are investing for the long run for our retirement. Everyone is a fucking genius in a bull market, and I think a lot of people in the sub, whether a newcomer or an experienced investor, should listen to bearish predictions and advices and not become a victim of confirmation bias._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Moving Events of Next Week.

As you may know, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is a leading provider of microchips. They have made their business by staying independent and building the factories to manufacture the microchips. With such a fast paced industry it is challenging for the chip designers to keep their factories up to date. This is where TSM comes in. Additionally by outsourcing the manufacturing it allows the chip designers to operate a capital light business model.

To that end, I ask if there is any company like that in the pharmaceutical space. I imagine they could offer similar benefits. I know Teva does generics. I’m really looking for a manufacturer who owns no drugs to stay independent that pharmaceutical companies contract to make their drugs (ideally branded). I feel like at scale this would be a great business like TSM because the scale and manufacturing knowledge can be used across many drugs. Plus by renting out the factory across many pharma companies there is likely to be consistent utilization rather than large boom and bust demand cycles of individual drugs. It would also be a way for small companies to test more drugs without the need for major factory investment.

I welcome your thoughts and company names.

I recently started stock picking, aiming at promising companies recommended in this insightful sub. But at the moment, I buy and sell manually, without any threshold rule, or stop loss. 

I'm in for HODL obviously, as I pick companies for their leaders and plans, and not only fundamentals. But I would like to set a rule to protect my positions in case something very wrong happens.  

  
**What are your thresholds, rules of thumbs, or else in this case ?**

I imagine for example putting a Stop Loss order on each position as soon as it dips more than 30 %. But is it too much, or not enough ? Should it be 15% or 50 % ?

Normally, you would by SPY puts or something like that, but what about taking a bunch of (idk maybe 3-5) overvalued high Beta stocks und by puts on them instead?

Like, if the SPY is doing bad, I personally don`t see a bullcase for something like lyft, doordash oder zoom. One could use their higher volatility as a hedge against the overall systematic market risk. The main reason why I would diversify into at least 3 different companies to buy puts on, is to reduce the risk of my strategy. And don`t get me wrong, this is not a bet against one of those companies, but their high beta und high valuation make them more exposed to the systematic risk of the market.

A Sriwijaya Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500 plane with 62 people on board lost contact with the control tower after taking off from Jakarta on a domestic flight.

* The plane lost more than 10K feet of altitude in less than a minute before falling off the radar, according to tracking data from FlightRadar24.
* Local reports in Indonesia indicate that suspected debris from the plane has been found in the sea off the city, although it has not been confirmed it is from the missing plane.
* Looking toward 2021, Boeing is hoping to see demand pick up and for it to cut the gap in deliveries with Airbus this year.

I was a bit interested at TSLA stock in 2019 but my thoughs were  that this stock was way overvalued, especially compared to the amount of cars delivered by the company.

My thoughts were partially influenced by a professional investment magazine that I suscribed in my country in order to have some "professional opinions", instead of reddit only, who thought the same and even told people to sell TSLA in April 2020. Looking at the price of TSLA now, I unsubscribed of course.

But still, I do not understand why TSLA did such an impressive bull run like this. I know that TSLA is valued as a tech company, not a car manufacturer. But still, this bubble is scary. And as a guy who was interested in TSLA before and did not buy, I am quite sad now to have missed the train.

I’ve recently started educating myself by reading some books such (Rich Dad Poor Dad, One Up on Wallstreet, The Intelligent Investor). I’ve also been creeping on this Subreddit for awhile. 

I also want to mention that I’m 32, F and have other investments (3 properties plus emergency cash to last 2 years that I keep adding to). 

This year I’ve decided to dabble into stocks. My main purpose would be to buy and hold for at least 10 years or so. I know there are scenarios where people have a hard time dealing with the dips and panic sell but personally I don’t think I’m that kind of person. I bought my first real estate property 10 years ago and never once thought of selling even when the Toronto condo market was at its highest. 

I don’t find Index funds particularly interesting as I’d rather invest in individual stocks that I truly believe in. My field is IT and so I’m very interested in the tech industry. My game plan is to keep aside $1500 per month for stock investment purposes. Keep purchasing stocks per month and just forget about them for at least 10 years. I plan on rotating between buying: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Visa.

For example, Kellogg's or General Mills. They pay \~ 3.7% each.  Lop 25% off for taxes, and you're left with a 2.75% gain.  Subtract out the 1.59% margin rate and you're looking at approximately a 1.15% profit.  Even Coke pays a 3.25% yield, and they've paid a dividend for over 120 years and have increased it every year for the past 55-60 years.  Had I known about IB and their insanely low margin rates during the pandemic, I probably would've loaded up on some high-quality stocks and gotten 5%+ yields AND made a boatload of money simply due to the share price going up.  So if I had decided to hold onto those gains for just 6 months, I would've only paid 0.8% for the loan.

I understand 1.15% isn't much, as they could raise margin rates OR the share price could decrease by 1.15% or more (within minutes, technically)  However, these are stable stocks.  Both K/GIS are right at the midpoint of their 52-wk range.  If they went down, you could hold for a while and collect the dividend, waiting for the share price to increase.  If they end up going up, well, you can simply sell and book a profit -- especially if it's for a lot more than 1.15%.  Since I plan on holding for the longer term, I'm also interested in buying quality stocks right before they release their earnings.  If it's a good earning report, the stock will go up that day and I'll probably make a lot more than 1.15% profit in that day alone.  If the stock goes down, no biggie.  I'll hold it for the next 3, 6, 9 months -- whatever.  Maybe even a year or more.  Statistically, it'll go back up and I'll walk away with a gain.  

So that was the 'safe' stock angle.  I'm also interested in the angle of high-yield stocks, such as Horizon Technology Finance (HRZN), HTGC or TPVG.  HRNZ has typically paid \~10% annual yields (paid monthly), and have done so for \~ the past 10 years.  That's their business strategy; they a 'venture debt/business development company.'  They selectively provide loans to start-ups and have relatively stable income to support their payouts.  When you compare stocks that don't pay dividends to ones that pay high dividends, you see a stark contrast in their share prices over the years.  Typically companies that don't pay dividends see (hope) their share price goes up and up and up.  Think MSFT.   
 Companies that pay a lot in dividends see their share price go up very slowly over time (think: VZ & ATT)  And since these 'venture debt' companies pay out even higher dividends than higher-yield dividend stocks, their share price ends up staying relatively flat over the years as a higher level of cash is flowing out of the company on a regular basis.  If I started borrowing on margin, I'd only make these BDC companies a smaller part of my investment; less than 10%  

Now another wrinkle to all this:  I currently have $110k in paper gains, and I've been selling as the stocks keep going up.  If things start going south, in the markets, I anticipate I'd book at least $75k gains (stop losses) So part of my investing angle is kinda to gamble; if I have a 50/50 of buying right before earnings, I may end up with a decrease in share price right off the bat.  I could sell my position at a loss OR I could ride it out.  Let's say I ride it out for 9 months and get show a $5k loss on 1 stock, but I've pulled in $2k in dividends.  The cookie jar is short by $3k, but I can sell that $5k loss and use it to off-set my big 2021 gains.  No, I'm not saying I'm trying to lose money, but if I have losses, then I can use them to off-set gains and pay lower taxes as a result.

So what is the real downside to this strategy?  Obviously a 'margin call' but I'm not talking about going all-in.  TIA for your ideas & input.  

TLDR; talk me out of using super-cheap margin to buy stocks that pay good dividends._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions/analysis on FUTU? I’m in 500 shares at $65.

So I am in my early twenties and I’m trying to get started in actually setting myself up for the future rather than just struggling to pay for the now (thank god). 

I was wondering if people had publications, websites, or other informational materials they use to identify and analyze potential markets to break into/companies to invest in. Obviously there’s this page and my own independent research but I just want to expand.

I’m very interested in “renewable” energy and that market. ENPH is a company I really like and think will grow well over the next few years. 

Additionally, I’m also very interested in the legal marijuana market here in the US. With the dems having control of every branch in the federal government and the growing decriminalization/legalization of recreational use, I think the leading companies with the most dispensaries are in a great position to continue expanding and if and when pot becomes legalized they can really take off. Still doing research on that front.

I don’t have a ton of money to use only for investing but putting in a lump sum and adding incrementally seems better than doing nothing at all. I’d only buy a few stocks of ENPH at first and fill the rest of my initial lump sum into the other market. I understand diversification is important, but I’m not overflowing with cash here but just wanting to get started. I appreciate the feedback.

I know conventional wisdom is that exposure to International equities (SWISX) and US bonds (SWAGX) are helpful for diversification purposes, but I really don't see how the lagging returns of these funds justify their place in a modern portfolio. 

Does anyone else see the irony in people telling investors that past performance doesn't equal future returns, yet they immediately cite that in past decades international stocks have sometimes outperformed US equities? 

From what I can tell, the US is better positioned than it has ever been to continue to grow exponentially (not to mention that US companies draw on international resources/labor and inherently benefit the most when emerging markets grow).

Elon may adopt fuelcell tech because :

- By adopting the hydrogen power  TSLA's hype train will gain an additional boost for years.

After its last run, Tesla is now worth 9 times Volkswagen (VW). You could argue that there is a bubble and Tesla stocks will go down hard eventually, which is true, at least to some degree. But will it lose 90% of its value and remain at that valuation? I highly doubt that. 

For those who don't know, VW owns major brands like Škoda, Seat, Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, among others, so it offers cars in every price segment. 
ln the last couple of years, VW has invested a lot of money into EV, creating a modular platform for all their brands (MEB) and the core brand released both their ID.3 and ID.4 this year, which were promptly sold out.

Now I want to compare Tesla's and VW's chances in a new car market dominated by EV:

Advantages Tesla:
- Hype, image, design
- They were the first movers, which was an advantage because they could focus on their strengths and force competition to follow their lead
- current market share in EV
- autonomous driving (although 'real' autonomy is still far away and others could catch up/cooperate; https://on.ft.com/38aIV0v)

Advantages VW:
- experience building cars, quality of production
- existing factories with staff (ramping up production numbers is comparatively easy)
- existing retail network
- different brands offer the opportunity to target their customers more specifically, improving margins

Basically, Tesla's biggest problem is production, they can't increase production numbers as fast as the EV market does, so they will lose market share, giving other players a chance to compete. Even though VW was late to the party they are now in a position to overtake them in production and sales in 2021 or 2022 (e.g. Norway, where 52% of cars sold in 2020 were EV. In that segment Audi - owned by VW - surpassed Tesla in sales. Or Germany, where the ID.3 sold extremely well considering that delivery only just started in September).
NA is a market VW has historically not been very successful in, that might still be the case in the future, but I am optimistic about the rest of the world.

There are other reasons why I think VW will be successful:
- the company has remained highly profitable throughout hard times like the emission scandal and Corona, while at the same time investing huge amounts of money into the switch from combustion to EV
- if I am not mistaken, they also invested into Fuel cell technology, diversifying risk
- VW is market leader in China and Europe, people know and like their vehicles and will continue to buy them

The biggest issue VW has is probably software. Like most German companies, they seem to be unable to deliver competitive products in that aspect, but they'll sort it out eventually. 
Lastly, I want to say that I don't expect VW to rise as much as Tesla did (obviously), yet I expect huge jumps in the future, decreasing the gap in market cap of both companies. Patience is key. 
I would love to hear if you agree with my analysis or not. Please point out aspects I might have forgotten to take into consideration._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice on new IPOS

I flip back and forth on whether or not we actually are in the midst.

But on a purely psychological-level, when everyone is saying we are in a bubble makes me think we aren’t actually – historically bubbles happen when everyone turns a blind-eye to excessive rises in asset prices. People aren’t turning a blind-eye yet, in fact everyone keeps making claims and saying be cautious. So I think in a contrarian sense prices will continue to rise for the short- and medium- term at least until sentiment shifts and everyone begins to think that this is all normal and BAU again. We aren’t there yet. There’s possibility of external factors coming into play: shutdown risk (I personally believe this risk is low), no future stimulus (low again), etc. Then again, I may be the one making that BAU case, only time will tell...

People look at the price of bitcoin (\~40k) and think that that's ridiculous and there's no point in buying anymore... But fail to take into consideration of its market cap (600 bn) when compared to its competitor gold (10 trillion).

Just like they did 2 years ago when the price of bitcoin was at $4000. "Wow $4000 is too expensive. There's no point in buying bitcoin!" Except it was 1/200th the market cap of gold at that point. For some reason people base their investment decision on the price of a stock or asset (which is a pointless metric) rather than its market cap in comparison to their competitors, or total addressable market.

On another point, gold's value comes from its BRAND and scarcity. That brand has taken thousands of years to build.

**"Now, here's the thing, Bitcoin has gone past a hurdle most of us never thought it would - investment banks are advising their clients to buy it, institutions are buying it, HNW investors are dumping gold and going for it.**

This is massive. This is BRAND.

Forget Bitcoin's intrinsic use, no-one ever cared about gold's either, but as more sophisticated investors buy into Bitcoin, which will spur on others, it will entrench itself as digital gold."

Now the two biggest fintech companies on the planet, PayPal and Square are promoting its mass adoption. People can open up their iPhones/Androids and buy directly from Venmo And Cash App **soon**, if they're not already able to do that.

The company originally planned to go public in December but delayed its debut after DoorDash and Airbnb soared more than expected out of the gates.

The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol "RBLX."

Roblox said on Friday in an updated prospectus that it plans to go public through a direct listing next month, after the online game company delayed its debut in December.

Earlier this week, Roblox disclosed that it raised $520 million in a private financing round ahead of a direct listing. By taking this route to the public markets instead of a traditional IPO, Roblox is following Spotify, Slack, Palantir and Asana, sidestepping a share sale and instead allowing existing stakeholders and employees to sell stock to new investors right away.

The latest funding round, at $45 a share, valued Roblox at $29.5 billion. In the updated filing, Roblox said an independent valuation report in December placed the shares at $41.52 apiece. By raising some money before going public, Roblox was able to pad its balance sheet and preserve the ability to bring in more capital through a secondary sale later this year.

Under the direct listing, the NYSE will set a reference price for the stock the night before Roblox's debut, but no shares will be traded at that price. In the morning, the market makers will match buyers and sellers to determine the opening price and the stock will be available to the broader market under the ticker symbol "RBLX."

Roblox had been considering a more traditional IPO, but tabled its plans last month after DoorDash and Airbnb popped on consecutive days, leading to concern that the company risked leaving too much money on the table.

"Due to market volatility and the performance of other recent underwritten initial public offerings, we have elected to file this prospectus as an amendment to the registration statement and pursue a direct listing to permit determination of the opening public price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers," Roblox said in the prospectus.

Because it's not doing an IPO, Roblox no longer requires underwriters. The company said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will stay on as financial advisers, but JPMorgan, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets were removed from the filing.

Roblox, which first released its service in 2006, is hitting the public market following a year of dramatic growth as kids, who were forced to stay home during the pandemic, spent more time playing games.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 91% from a year earlier to $242.2 million. Daily active users almost doubled in the period ended September to 36.2 million and "hours engaged" more than doubled to 8.7 billion.

On Roblox's app, users create an avatar that they can move between millions of different games. They're all free to play, but users buy virtual currency called Robux for advanced features or to build their character.

The games are created by outside developers, who share the revenue with Roblox. The company said in the updated filing that in the first three quarters of 2020, the platform had about 3,800 developers, who earned $215 million. That's up from a year earlier, when 2,400 developers made $72.2 million.

While many game creators cash out into real world currency, "some choose to reinvest their Robux into developer tools, promote their experiences through our internal ad network, or spend the Robux as any other user would," the company said.

I'm using xm broker and I'm sure that I could buy stocks with them because I saw it as an option. As much as I know I'm on a standard trading acc. 
This problem occurred on both demo and real account. I tried to add some symbols like tesla, apple, etc but it doesn't seem to work either. Any help/advice would be very much appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How will other stocks be affected by the Tesla bubble bursting? Elon is now the richest man in the world and Tesla stock has grown to ridiculous levels. At this point a big correction seems inevitable (though it has seemed like this for years). What do you think will happen and are you in anyway preparing for it?

Will this lead to losses across the EV sector? 

What stocks do you think will benefit from it? 

And will it put an end to this era of meme stocks?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock gain doesn't match account gain? So my stock net change was +$316 from yesterday's closing to today's closing.
My account net change only increased by $166 during that same time. Am I missing some information? 
Sorry but just getting started in investing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
