Key points:

- One nationwide telehealth provider, CallOnDoc, sees many patients with chronic disease who need ongoing care. They’ve been seeing an emerging trend around remote monitoring for patients who have conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.  [...] In 2021, we’ll see telehealth continue to play a huge role for patients with these kinds of issues. 

- One reason that telehealth providers were able to scale so quickly during the pandemic is because the U.S. Health and Human Services office relaxed certain regulations. This made it easier for doctors and hospitals to offer telehealth services quickly, without worrying as much about HIPAA privacy requirements or whether patients with Medicaid or Medicare could be eligible for services. 

- One of the positive healthcare developments that the pandemic has brought is a renewed focus on the importance of mental health services. [...] Telehealth providers are taking note, as well. With so many people experiencing anxiety and depression, many telehealth providers are offering virtual mental health resources to their patients. This includes everything from licensed counselors to psychiatrists. 

- Telehealth is poised to continue growing in 2021, offering greater access to patients of all types: the elderly, those with mental health needs, pediatric patients, and more._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Viatris So I received VTRS in my portfolio the other day due to my PFE holdings.

I also bought some more today at $16 (was limit order executed on market open today).  Mostly was to make a nice round figure of total stocks, since the "free" stocks were an odd looking number.  Price is up over 9% so far today.

I expect them to recover at come point with the 737 max being cleared recently but the orders are low on them still because of the new resurgence of COVID._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren’t Too Expensive. Here’s Why. Tech stocks have soared this year as the pandemic rapidly shifted people to remote work and school. Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren’t overvalued.

First off, these stocks—Facebook ￼ (ticker: FB), Apple ￼ (AAPL), Amazon ￼ (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft ￼ (MSFT)—are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000—before the tech bubble burst.

Lately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks’ valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.

Many on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren’t affected by changes in the economy—while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.

Evercore strategists recently said they only see S&P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don’t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.

But David Kostin, Goldman Sachs’ chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that “fundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.”

Kostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.

Comparing these companies’ earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates—which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is—further justifies Kostin’s point. Facebook’s PEG ratio—calculated by taking the stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate—is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon’s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet’s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft’s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.

With the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.

All five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon’s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.

The point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason—don’t count them out.

Source: Barron's_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sonos - Hold or Sell I made a good amount on my Sonos shares today and I'm really happy about that - but as Sonos reaches (or in the case of this morning, blows past) its market cap, I'm starting to consider a sale.

Two things I'm considering - 

1) RBC capital upgraded Sonos' market cap to $24, a claim I'm slightly skeptical about but would appreciate feedback. 

2) Sonos would be a prime target for acquisition by a bigger player in the industry such as Google or Amazon, as they seek to compete with the Apple HomePod on audio quality in their Echo/Nest products. Again, skeptical about this - there are better companies to acquire if Google or Amazon wanted to bolster their audio engineering, so a Sonos acquisition would be more to acquire patents and/or the use of Sonos's proprietary wireless audio sharing platform, which would be of more use to Amazon than Google. 

Is my thinking correct here? Should I cash in and move on, or hold for another week or so?

Almost everyday people on the sub discuss stocks that have the potential for a significant comeback if/when the situation comes back to normal. I want to discuss something different here, companies that are attempting, or more correctly - are being forced to transform themselves to align to the new world instead. If you know of such companies and want to talk about them - go ahead and post that right here.

The most obvious plays - major ecommerce players/delivery companies/food staples and consumables have already appreciated significantly and that is not what I'm looking for. 

It seems like what one is ought to be looking for is companies that already had minor digital presence that are now being forced to shift to full digital to cut the rental costs of expensive mall retail space/etc... A simple site with a delivery option for their products signals that they have the staff and have figured out the logistics on how to operate as an ecommerce company. The next logical step is transforming from a store -> consumer business into a warehouse -> consumer business, aided by the internet.

Of course the risk with many companies that relied on foot traffic in expensive retail locations such as malls/etc... is the risk of bankruptcy from their creditors due to lockdowns/reduced consumer presence in general. They may not climb out of the hole fast enough even with a successful shift to an online business, so there is an absolutely massive risk here.

I was advised by many people in family to setup recurring investment and not pay much attention to it on daily basis (haven’t done that yet). I end up seeing the market 4 to 5 times a day.

I had a plan of investing 50bucks every week. Should I setup recurring investment to maybe 2 stocks and split 25/25 or should I just watch market and invest it whenever it is a red day?

I’m 25 and work in tech sector. So I like to follow these companies and would want to invest in them most probably.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR Whatsup y’all, interested to hear peoples thoughts/analysis on CRSR? Got in around $15.77 and since the IPO launch they’ve been on a constant rise.

I am looking to start investing in either Home Depot or Microsoft for the long term 10years+ (assuming the companies stay healthy). I'm basing my investment on two main things: Dividends and Growth.

I’m pretty new to investing and was silly in buying a couple shares of JKS when it was peaking around $80. Figured there was no way it could halt for at least a few days and I’d sell out after a quick profit. Naturally it took a nosedive and I’m wondering if I can expect it to get back up to those levels anytime soon or if I’m in it for the long haul? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon stocks, but before holidays?? Yo, so i feel like right now, right before the holidays no one is remembering to buy gifts or jack for their the ones the “love”, and because of covid-19 i feel like a lot more people will jump to amazon for their holiday purchases this year and maybe last minute gift shopping since everything else is closed.

i feel this hype might show on the stock market too so i’m thinking of throwing in right now and selling during or right after holiday the holidays when people hop off amazons massive dong.
is this a good idea? yes? no?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Passive income... really? Passive investment is not really passive unless you are active....
This reverse thinking should be part of every passive income seeker, you have to actively manage your asset to make sure its providing the investment it suppose to deliver, so are there any truly passive income sources?

Real estate surly isn't, either is every renting service, gigs are fun but time consuming, can investment in the market be considered as passive investment?

The answer is yes! But (and there is alway a but...) you have to close a large knowledge gap to achieve this passivity, or find someone who already closed it and is there.

What's real passive income for you?

**Notable Decliners:**

* \-5.6% **RHI-US** (Robert Half): Downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse; cited valuation; argued significant declines in initial claims and vaccine optimism limiting near-term catalysts; noted suboptimal exposure to small- and mid-sized businesses.

I have 300 in NIO and 100 in PLTR. I would be selling NIO for profit and be able to accumulate about 300 shares in PLTR.

My concern is that NIO is slightly over valued (after seeing it being bigger than GM, honda etc) and feel there would be a crash soon. Ignoring the diversification of portfolio etc (this is money I am happy to lose).

For simplicity let's compare similar stocks. Let's compare Tesla and NIO.

So current prices for Tesla/NIO (give and take obviously)

NIO: $46.48

Tesla: $497.55

I know that Tesla was worth around 1700-2000 or something when it split. 
I'm not aware of any NIO splits.

How the heck do you calculate the value comparison between the two? Obviously, Tesla is way more expensive per share, but couldnt that mean NIO just has more shares in the market and is actually on an equal level of value or similar? 

I guess I'm just super confused on how you can compare stock prices when they clearly have different stock quantities and do splits and stuff.

Apple announces tax cuts for its app store while big retailers like Lowe’s and Target released earnings yesterday, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as all 3 big indexes finished in the red with the Nasdaq droping 0,8% despite hovering above positive for a good part of the day while both the SP500 and the Dow Jones finished down 1,16% also with a big sell off at the end of the trading. This after the Mayor of New York announced that the city will once again switch schools to online due to them having reached a 3% testing positivity rate on a 7day moving average scale. The volatility index saw a small spike after dropping constantly in the last weeks but is still in a clear downtrend from the highs of November.

Here is the heat map from yesterday and it’s clear that is though to find and bright spots in the stock market, with small exceptions like TESLA which continue to have great momentum with the SP500 tailwind still pushing the company, while Zoom jumped in the green after the New York news. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JQ7cz65)

Over 60% of the companies were declining on below average volume yesterday as there might be some retracements to the 50 and 200-day moving averages as a lot of the stocks are trading quite high above them. Almost all sectors were in the red yesterday with energy and real estate being the most heavily hit by the increasing restrictions also there was no clear outperformer in large cap vs small caps though momentum and growth did a littler better than the value plays. The recent drops and stagnation in the stock market is likely due to investors not knowing what to focus on, as the vaccine news have been a great positive and will help the economy recover in the future but in the meantime the pandemic is raging on and the near term future is uncertain. [CHART](https://ibb.co/fHsqMHt) [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hDRdM8G) [CHART](https://ibb.co/7tFNCy4)

Yesterday we saw some great numbers as the October housing starts were almost 5% better month to month as Today we are going to receive some critical economic data that might see the market recover a little or if they are bad can accelerate the correction as initial jobless claims and continuing jobless claims come in the early part of the morning. [ECONOMIC CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZdBVH9m)

Also, yesterday the American Association of Individual Investors released the weekly investor sentiment survey as bullishness has declined by more than 11% since last week, as investors switch to a more neutral approach. I believe this is a great contrarian indicator as more people become bearish you can find better buying opportunities in the stock market [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/7RZK3j4)

So after the close yesterday Nvidia announced a beat of 36 cents on the expectation with an EPS of 2,91$ which is a more than 1$ improvement since last year and a beat of over 300 million $ on revenue, which have seen a more than 50% increase since last year. Gaming revenues came in even better than expected at 2,27 billion$ while data center revenue also improved more than 160% year over year and also was better than expectations. [NVIDIA REVENUE](https://ibb.co/hcTzGSj) [NVIDIA FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/SBh3BTY)

Gross profit margin decreased year over year but is still better through the first 9 months of the year. With the net income for the company being also in line with these numbers. [NVIDIA EPS](https://ibb.co/wdGD49R)

They also announced they will give out a dividend, it does have a small yield but it’s better than nothing and also gave guidance for next quarter that was 10% better than forecasted on revenue with the gross margin also expected to improve about 140 basis points. [NVIDIA DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/tKgC0Qx)

Nvidia might get a boost soon as they have just refiled the merger notification for the ARM deal, if they do manage to acquire ARM, this will greatly improve the company’s outlook as it might propel them to join the tech trillion dollar valuation as the global gaming industry has spiked up almost 20% year over year and is expected to have a compound annual growth of almost 10% in the next years. [GAMING INDUSTRY](https://ibb.co/Y73jC3s) [GAMING CAGR](https://ibb.co/K64FsYW) [NVIDIA ARM DEAL](https://ibb.co/5RM0Cvp)

So I believe they are a great company to invest in for the future and you can buy this dip after the earnings because there was no week point in them, I would buy more of the company if the stock falls under 500$. [NVIDIA PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/1ntybNM)

Yesterday Apple also announced that they will cut the apple store tax in half to 15% for smaller developers starting next year. Though this impacts 98% of developers in the app store, it will only affect about 5% of the revenue so the impact on the EPS should be pretty small as Morgan Stanley only expects this to be a 3 cents per share down-risk for Apple. This action has been taken by the company to probably divide developers as they continue the legal battle with Epic Games. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/PMbFv3f) [APPLE IMPACT](https://ibb.co/TqsrSTc)

Also, two big retailers released earnings yesterday with Target delivering a solid beat of more than a dollar per share and a revenue beat of almost 2 billion $ with comparable sales almost doubling the expectations. They did not provide any guidance but a strong holiday season will likely see the company doing very well in the next quarter. The company saw a huge increase in both traditional store of 10% and a stunning 155% growth in online sales. This came alongside a 80 basis points increase in gross margin as well to top the expectations. This led the stock to gain more than 2% on a day when the stock market was trending down. [TGT DIGITAL SALES](https://ibb.co/Jtp0NV7) [TGT EPS](https://ibb.co/Hxd2NcD)

The other big retailer that released earnings was Lowe’s as the company just beat the expectations by 2 cents but delivered a better result on revenue while the comparable sales were up more than 30% and the online sales more than doubled for the company. This wasn’t enough for the stock to hold as it saw the price plunge by more than 8% on the day as investors were not impressed by the weak profit guidance for next quarter with an EPS between 1,10$ to 1,20$ versus the expectations of 1,17$. I don’t think was a good indicator for the company’s outlook and could be a great opportunity to buy the stock on the dip. [LOWES STATS](https://ibb.co/WsWrfZV) [LOWES EPS](https://ibb.co/Q6rtWZQ)

A quick though about the Tesla stock being added to the SP doesn’t add any significant value for the company but it is an important milestone as 51 billion $ worth of other SP500 position will be sold so that the company can be added to the  index fund. They are the biggest company ever to be added to the index. Tesla Is not a traditional car company, it’s a disruptive technology company on the EV front, that’s why its valuation is so high compared to other car makers like you can see in this report from Morgan Stanley as they raised the price target by almost 200$ to a price of 540$ for the stock. This is also helped by more and more countries imposing restrictions and announcing bans on traditional fossil fueled cars in the future.   [BRITAIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/CM4PmQ8) [MS Analysts](https://ibb.co/N2b2fdJ)

Other news came yesterday for companies like Shopify which will accept direct payments via Alipay which has more than 1 billion users in China which will improve the payment flow for companies that use the platform. [SHOPIFY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vZSDLNn)

While NIO gained target boost from multiple banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and others as they expect the company to be a long-term winner in the premium EV space and gain a significant market share in the next decade, the stock did fell on the report that Nikola and GM are close to finalizing the deal to manufacture the Nikola Badger as Nikola shares gained more than 15% on the day. [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/8XQLG85) [NIKOLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6gmZqXL)

Also, the controversial company Palantir secured another US army contract and saw it’s shares rise again to all time highs intra-day, as the company keeps getting the stamp of approval from the government with more and more contracts. [PALANTIR NEWS](https://ibb.co/GMpQWj0)

Google also seems to be jumping in the action for more and more online payments solutions as the company will allow users to open bank accounts through Google Pay. The accounts will not be charged monthly fees or require minimum balances which is pretty much in line with the other competitors aproach. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/tPXXmz0)

And one final though just like Bill Gates said yesterday, Zoom will continue be a great company to own, as they’re product is superior to competitors, business travel will never go back to what it was, this is happening while a lot of people are taking risks and dumping money in cruise lines stocks and restaurant stocks.

If so what is it called if you were to assume the other 60% shares not listed on a stock exchange were worth the same.

Making the company worth 100,00 in this scenario.

* British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.
* The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection.
* The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.

The preliminary findings of a phase two trial show that the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is safe and triggers a similar immune response among all adults.The promising early-stage results were published in The Lancet, one of the world’s top medical journals, on Thursday.The study of 560 healthy adults, including 240 over the age of 70-years-old, found the vaccine to be safe and produced a similar immune response among people aged over 56-years-old and those aged between 18 and 55. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.A safe and effective vaccine is seen by many as a game-changer in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of over 1.3 million people worldwide.Huge challenges remain before a vaccine can be rolled out, however. The global battle to secure prospective supplies has raised alarm about equitable access, while questions remain over logistics, distribution, and cost.The Oxford vaccine candidate was found to cause few side effects and triggered immune responses in both parts of the immune system in all age groups and at low and standard doses.The preliminary results showed that the vaccine — ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 — prompted what’s known as a “T-cell response” within 14 days of the first dose, and an antibody response within 28 days of the booster dose. Scientists expect T-cell responses to play a role in long-term immunity against the virus.Dr. Maheshi Ramasamy, a co-author of the study at the University of Oxford, said the antibody and T-cell responses among older adults were “robust” and “encouraging.”“The populations at greatest risk of serious COVID-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults,” Ramasamy said.“We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”

## Study limitations

The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection. The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.Results are expected later this year depending on the rate of infection within clinical trial communities.The authors noted some limitations to their study, including that participants in the oldest age group had an average age of 73 to 74 and few underlying health conditions, and almost all participants were White and non-smokers.People from a range of backgrounds, countries, and ethnicities were said to be included in the phase three trial.The study comes days after two other vaccine makers announced encouraging results from phase three trials. They said their experimental vaccines were found to be highly effective in protecting against the coronavirus, boosting optimism at a time when health systems in Europe and the U.S. are once again being pushed to breaking point.Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday a final analysis found their vaccine candidate was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 and appeared to fend off severe disease. Earlier this week, Moderna had said preliminary phase three trial data showed its vaccine was 94.5% effective._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy $AMD ? I'm planning to buy the AMD stock:

However, I constantly end up thinking about the markets and looking at my portfolio. For example, when I’m going outside to shop or eat I’ll try to look at the labels of different items and observing people around me to see what brands they’re buying just to see if that’s something I can invest into. I spent any time not spent on school work looking at different articles and whatnot and trying to understand which stock is gonna be the next big thing.

Currently investing in ARK, ICLN, SPY and MGK._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CALX (CALIX) a growth stock focusing on edge cloud connectivity and unified access I searched this subreddit and I noticed that no one has posted anything about CALX. This stock has been hot since June, where its almost doubled in price.

Calix targets Communication Services Providers (CSPs) and provides hardware and software that makes offering services easier. To simplify: they make it easier for service providers to offer broadband to customers.

CALX provides three products:

1. Calix cloud - analytics cloud front end for understanding utilization
2. EXOS - a container based operating system to make accessing subscribers easier
3. AXOS - physical network devices that make connectivity from access to data center simplier

Over the past 3 quarters, Calix's revenues have grown by 50% while their COGS and expenses have remained flat. This has turned Calix's operating income from negative to positive in the past three quarters: https://s22.q4cdn.com/999083100/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Calix-Website-20Q3-Historical-Financials.pdf

The stock price has reinforced that, with 20% jumps across the past three earnings periods. The stock is up almost 100% since June.

Their momentum is picking up as well, as they are driving higher margins by having higher sales of their cloud platform.

They are on track to finish the year with EPS of around 0.90 for the entire year. Their net income target for FY2020 at around $32M. With their current market cap at 1.5B, that's a multiplier of approximately 46. But if you look at just revenue, which may be better for a high growth company that only recently became profitable, their revenue multiple is an appealing 5.5

The EPS estimate for the end of the year is aiming to be around 0.80, which makes the P/E ratio around 30. Which is low for a potentially high growth tech company.

The biggest challenge for CALX will be sustaining their current growth rates. Their growth is new, and if they can't keep finding new CSPs to continue to sell their product, they could fizzle out quickly. But I don't see this as a threat since work-from-home and shelter-at-home macro trends have driven up demand for consumer broadband, Calix is well positioned to reap the rewards of these shifting consumer needs.

The second challenge is that they play in the networking space which has historically been a low margin environment. Their margins are actually an impressive 50%, which means that their product offering is seen as having good value and serves as a premium.

CALX may be a good stock to watch, because if they can grow at the rate they currently are, the stock price may continue to push up much more aggressively. They're currently down 10% from their ATH on November 5.

Is there anyone buying and holding CALX as a potential long term play?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are reverse splits somewhat bullish if a stock is planning to uplist to NASDAQ?

"ARK Investment Management—a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago—has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record. The firm’s success hasn’t only been spotted by many investors, but also by one of its early backers and minority shareholders.

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year.

It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021. ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake."

Most don't have hype.

Even among those that have hype, there are the second-tier ones, and then there are the best ones, the blockbuster events.

Consider this snippet from Jim Cramer's Mad Money:

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/jim-cramer-hyliion-has-a-compelling-story-but-be-patient-on-stock.html

He noted four price trends.

**I**

"When [the reverse merger company] announced the Hyliion deal, **its stock spiked from $10** in mid-June to $34 less than two weeks later."

**II**

"**It cooled off** from those levels"

**III**

"**Before roaring** to the mid-50s after Tesla really took off in August"

I've mentioned this before in previous threads, but this part, the "IPO pop" is what separates the blockbuster events from the second-tier hype plays.

The magnitude of the "IPO pop" is much greater, such that more money can be made here than in the first part.

A realistic opportunity to double one's money or more, in as little as two weeks, presents itself here.  Below are some examples.

Despite the current controversies, Nikola (NKLA) had an "IPO pop" that was a blockbuster event.

During the summer, electric truck startup Hyliion (HYLN) had an ["IPO pop" that was a blockbuster event](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):

> [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

> “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

> He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Not long after, [electric truck startup Lordstown Motors (RIDE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j9hzmi/electric_truck_startup_lordstown_motors_going/) had an "IPO pop" that was a blockbuster event.

**IV**

"Now, I've repeatedly warned you about how the way these [reverse merger companies] trade!  They tend to spike going into the deal, and **then they pull back hard** when the transaction went through"

This part is self-explanatory, and there are multiple reasons for this.
