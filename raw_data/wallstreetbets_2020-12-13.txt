 What is the average time you hold positions? I started trading around 2 months ago and its been an insane rollercoaster. Began with 4 k and Nio and xpeng pumped me up to 14k, but i held them too long and dropped to 6k. Then i started doing weekly trades on palantir and cannabis stocks before resorting to day trades on gme and kodak. Frankly the day trades were a bloodbath and i am now going back to the weekly strategy since i went down by a lot and need to claw back losses.

Long story short I was wondering how long people here tipically held positions and what they found worked best for them?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Psychadelic Stonks Alright autists, I have no doubt at some point your doctors have tried to cure your retardation by administering Psilocybin or even LSD, so I won't get into why Psilocybin is a fucking great idea, more than ever right now for our society, ([https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/10/magic-mushrooms-treatment-depression-aztecs-psilocybin-mental-health-medicine](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/10/magic-mushrooms-treatment-depression-aztecs-psilocybin-mental-health-medicine)) but what are some companies that are investing in the Pscilocybin space that can return some major hallucinogenic tendies if I buy like 2+ year leaps on them, or just buy stonks like a boomer?  


Positions: what I'm fucking after tbh_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Facebook stonks TL/DR. Facebook has been destroying itself by banning tens of thousands of people for little to no reason and i predict it's value in shares to collapse relatively soon.



I've been on Facebook since it's inception, back when you had to have a college email to get on. Needless to say I've put much time and effort into building my profile. So back in August of this year I woke up and logged into my Facebook only to find the message, "Your account has been disabled". I thought surely this is a mistake of some sort and didn't worry too much about it. I thought to myself "I'll message Facebook support and they'll straighten it out". I went through all the hoops and NEVER received any correspondence whatsoever. The only thing I received was a notification upon login attempt that my account has been disabled due to a violation of the terms of service. I've never violated Facebook's TOS. I began digging online only to find this has happened to tens of thousands of other users at the same time and more then once. I discovered most of it here in Reddit in the r/facebook thread. Apparently Facebook's AI algorithm went rogue and started banning people for anything, even posts that were 2 to 3 years old. I personally know 4 people who received bans as well with no clue why they got banned. I expected something in the news, but nothing. Time goes on.

I waited almost a whole month and no resolution or correspondence. So i just gave up and created a new account. The second account got banned within 2 months. For ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. I walked on eggshells with this account and it got banned. I created a third account and didn't even post anything. It got banned in a month again for nothing. I only created the third Facebook to use messenger, because that's how i communicated with everyone. So i create a 4th one. Instantly banned. I even used new emails and phone numbers.

So, how does this apply to WSB? Well, Facebook is self destructing right now and hardly anyone knows it. I predict people are going to abandon Facebook and it's revenue will drop causing a decline in it's share value. Nobody is receiving any correspondence from Facebook on the issue and nobody is getting their account back. 

Facebook is utilized by almost everyone and many people rely on it for revenue, business, and profit. Companies use it to background check potential employees, people use it to remain connected to everyone they know, and many use it just for the instant messenger feature, which requires you to have an account to utilize. Society has become practically dependant on Facebook to a degree. 

So why haven't i heard anything on this issue? What do you guys know? Does anyone have anything that could shed light on Facebook's future? I'm not posting this to highlight my problem, I'm posting it because i see a potential investment loss/opportunity here. What are some good strategies to prepare for this should Facebook's value decline?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The distribution begins: what to do. So this morning the vaccine shipments finally parted out of the Pfizer distribution center in Michigan. They‚Äôre calling for 145 sites to have it Monday, 425 sites to have it Tuesday, and 66 others to get it Wednesday. Yes that‚Äôs only 636 sites, but that‚Äôs a only from the first shipment. 

Front line workers in medical fields are going to be receiving the vaccine first, then essential workers, then the elderly, then you and everyone else. Since this is the order laid out, hospitals will be getting virtually all the vaccines at first, then organizations to administer it to the elderly. Due to this, I think some people will be disappointed in the volume going to CVS, so I might sit out of making that play for a bit. 

UPS and FedEx are going to be spearheading the distribution, two companies that I am skeptical to make any plays on as it seems they‚Äôve already rallied in anticipation of this, but a short term play could be a possibility. 

Airlines will be the big winner in the long term. Right now Delta, United, and American will be transporting the vaccine in designated planes. The downfall with this is that vaccines cannot be carried on the same planes as passengers. Transporting the -94 degrees coolers will require dry ice and is a cabin health hazard. Regardless, this is a huge sentiment booster for airlines and will allow them to get planes off the ground. 

As sentiment increases over airlines it will be a great time to get in as the next step will be transitioning from vaccines to actual passengers. In my opinion I see this as a super easy way to get ahead of the news. We know the headline is coming, just buy in and wait. 

Next, I am also skeptical about cruise lines. I am seriously willing to bet most people will not want to go on a cruise as their first activity post vaccination. Cheaper and quicker forms of entertainment that also allow for social interaction will be the best play, these include concert venues and bars or restaurants. 

To play this I have already loaded on live nation and will soon be buying into beverage companies. Vender purchases make up a large majority of beverage company sales and as bars and restaurants open again, these vendors will go back to making their usually purchases. It doesn‚Äôt matter what bar or restaurant closed or went out of business during this year, suppliers didn‚Äôt and will be receiving large orders when everyone takes their shot at starting up a new bar when things open.

This spike came from no other than our boy Steve Grasso from Fast Money on CNBC. Steve said, ‚ÄúI like to give you stocks that could double. I think this one could triple.‚Äù 

Now.. if I had your curiosity and now have your attention, feel free to keep reading below. 

BFT is a SPAC. If you‚Äôve been living in a cave and didn‚Äôt have internet access to waste your life on WSB, a SPAC is a company created for the sole purpose of taking another company public. It‚Äôs a newer technique that has proven to be a much quicker way to get your company a ticker. 

The company that will be getting a shinny new ticker is Paysafe. Paysafe is a multinational online payment system. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in London. Their largest marketshare is in Europe and are highly dominate in the gambling industry.  

Paysafe

Financials: $1.5 billion in revenue. $468 mil EBITDA profit. Net profit of $142 million. 

Customers: Paysafe is attached to very big names, in lots of sectors. Just a few are: Draftkings, Twitch, YouTube, Fortnite, Henri, Spotify, Staida, NH lottery. 

Key facts to note:

1. Process over $100 billion per year. 
2. Jacked to the tits on diversification. From a large global presence, to a huge foothold in several key sectors. This has helped them a ton during Corona when so many others have faltered, they have remained steady.  
3. Actually profitable, which is very rare for SPACS. 
4. Its major competitors (i.e. PayPal, Square, Venmo etc.) aren‚Äôt willing to move into gambling where Paysafe is dominating.  

I don‚Äôt want to hear any, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me 18 years ago when the stock was a penny. The price went up so it can never go up again‚Äù. This baby was just confirmed last week and is just starting to make it on major news networks. You will start to see more than just CNBC talking about it as it‚Äôs one of the largest SPACS of the year, and I would challenge any of them to not recommend it as a buy. If we get a huge name to give it a thumbs up we will see a corresponding huge pump during the next open.

BFT is merging with the company PaySafe. This a legitimate company.

Highlights for PaySafe- 

In business for over twenty years. This is a processing payment company that focuses on creating a niche in the gambling and iGaming industry. Notable customers include Twitch, Fortnite, Roblox,Stadia, Spotify, Draftkings, and various other lotteries. They also acquired Skrill which allows payment processing using currencies that cannot be named here.

If you want to read more about BFT here's a post from u/dhsmatt2 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000\_bet\_on\_fintech\_bft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)

The bottom line is this company is sound, it is not a pump and dump.

Enough of the fundamental stuff, because let's be honest - none of that matters anymore. Here are the most recent developments which are going to cause this stock moon:

This stock is part of the Fintech sector. The three big sectors that see the greatest rise in price movement are EV, Fintech, and Tech stocks.

This stock has had the HIGHEST VOLUME FOR 5 DAYS of any SPAC. How do I know? Because I track it and post it everyday, check my profile. This is likely because large institutions are accumulating shares and this will be reported/leaked in coming weeks which will further drive up the price. This SPAC has a floor of around 10, but given the significant accumulation around 12-13 there is significant support at this area.

This stock is already being mentioned on CNBC (twice last week). When the boomers and WSB both agree that a stock is a solid investment, there's likely to be a large increase in price.

Other notable mentions include a significant increase of Stocktwits followers - increased by 30% this weekend but still under 15k. There have also been 5 YouTube videos just today.

Lastly here's my position - Original 200k bet - now worth 230k.

Can anyone explain to me y everyone is freaking out??????_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PYPL/SQ/ARKF fintech DD Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VC‚Äôs and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to B(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy that‚Äôs an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but they‚Äôve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. I‚Äôll further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence

**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**

Paper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mr9elex5z0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e6eb1b9039d738af6c2ea5277018d2749cbbfd

Statista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their ‚Äúcash register‚Äù called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses.

So a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x99o8v39z0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c12fa73d91b1948acec47fe715cdefe8b4bfb3bb

### As you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around¬†20%.

This makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why I‚Äôll suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) ‚ÄúEmerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India‚Äù. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr(!)ptocurrency into transactions, but it‚Äôs likely the biggest reason people don‚Äôt switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where they‚Äôll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they don‚Äôt have to store cash.

***Paypal***

Paypal is ‚Äúa global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person‚Äù. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Square‚Äôs huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market that‚Äôs more likely to grow in the future.

As you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they haven‚Äôt been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPal‚Äôs full potential isn‚Äôt close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book ‚ÄúZero to One‚Äù that Paypal wouldn‚Äôt start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/78wifzfdz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bce649ad199031a1c5ddbfbdb663324b7ae3454

&#x200B;

¬†While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months you‚Äôd expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isn‚Äôt based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldn‚Äôt have grown nearly as much as it has.

Here‚Äôs what I mean:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/47r8msvez0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cefbcab0e52e1a1ca9e42b946f569f4a1595785

The amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that aren‚Äôt willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, that‚Äôs ‚Äúhorizontal innovation‚Äù AKA just globalism. That alone isn‚Äôt enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this it is only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.

Now you‚Äôll see below PYPL‚Äôs historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom you‚Äôll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypal‚Äôs track record when it comes to acquisitions they‚Äôve been very successful, so there‚Äôs not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypal‚Äôs investing, investors are excited. They‚Äôve piled up cash up until last year, and they‚Äôre finally using it now based off their cash per share:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rq6x4g8kz0561.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=976d294dbc9ceb68d288570648b9a894fde8c1ac

Add to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sector‚Äôs trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***

So you must be wondering why Paypal‚Äôs cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and free cash flow was only down due to ‚Äúpositive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio‚Äù which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and that‚Äôs why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7i979ldoz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=798113837df594aa112574facc98df32685c8c79

Paypal‚Äôs newly acquired capital is already being used and it‚Äôll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.

Now to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as it‚Äôs had the head start since the iPhone 4. Here‚Äôs how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.

Square also made a ‚Äúcash management‚Äù app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.

About Cash App: ‚ÄúCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.‚Äù

It appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQ‚Äôs revenues.

In Square‚Äôs 2019 annual report, they reported the following:

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed $106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards. At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.

As of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.

&#x200B;

[The above image shows Square‚Äôs payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQ‚Äôs stability.](https://preview.redd.it/rjjzniarz0561.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe83afdb1c1d8adc38f4c37325fde9c1b125f93)

&#x200B;

[This shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Square‚Äôs mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is working.](https://preview.redd.it/cj0vx6gsz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f72e7dad5f7cbe846c489a90be6fa8d81067dd)

Although their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different API‚Äôs for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model. They give small loans to businesses based on the data that they ***already have as Square manages the business‚Äô finances, remember? And this puts them at an advantage to make good debt because of the transparency into the business‚Äô finances. This will allow Square to make extremely profitable and high turnover loans that have virtually NO risk of default***. The types of loans they give are generally small, and they could be as little as $500. They describe these loans as the type you‚Äôd ask for from your parents or relatives. Square has such in-depth data from these businesses that when they make loans they don‚Äôt even *consider* credit scores: ‚ÄúGenerally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller‚Äôs expected annual GPV (their payment volume) and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan in eight to nine months on average‚Äù

Since 2014, Square has made over $6B in loans with a failure rate of only 4%, which makes sense because Square has access to all of its client‚Äôs financials so therefore they possess the ability to make fully transparent loans.

When you jump into Square‚Äôs financials, there‚Äôs a lot of promise to say the least:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a4zkobuvz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c1273cb128c0d627add76e54bb36a9b34941a1

Not only has revenue grown by 42% from 2018 to 2019, net income finally became positive in 2019 and free cash flow increased from 232m to 400m in the same span.

Here‚Äôs the revenue breakdown for Square, and as you can observe while transaction revenue saw much stronger compared to Paypal, the real deal was Square‚Äôs expansion of its enterprise solutions as those revenues increased by 74% last year, these are revenues recognized as the following: ‚ÄúRevenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings.‚Äù

Also in that same span, Square‚Äôs cash has nearly doubled. This liquidity will be necessary as Square Capital continues to grow and will require financing.

While Square is far riskier than Paypal, they seem to be capturing a much larger market and have a bigger vision for the future at this point. Paypal becomes more like Microsoft and Square is kind of like Apple if we went back 10 years. One of them has widespread use and an established platform but still has consistent growth (about 15%) and the other is finding itself in a competitive market but is also slowly establishing absolute dominance. Square is absolutely overvalued, but for a growth stock that‚Äôs nothing out of the ordinary, and so is Paypal considering they don‚Äôt have nearly as much a prospect for growth unless leadership shows a huge change in direction some time soon. The ‚ÄúPaypal Mafia‚Äù however has surprised us before and I think there‚Äôs a solid chance of growth still plausible for them. Regardless, both of these companies should be a holding in your portfolio amidst a growing FinTech sector and a huge transition away from traditional payments.

ARKF 1/15/21 55c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Week Ahead: Playing FOMC meeting amidst a bunch of other stuff happening (SPY, VXX, TLT) **For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms:** 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep

Given this repetitiveness of guidance, you'd assume the FOMC meetings to come are just boring ass affairs.  But, if you dig a little deeper into the nerdom, there are specific, subtle reasons this meeting in particular could have a huge affect on quantitative easing measures and the broader market, including SPY.

**I‚Äôm particularly viewing this through the lens of Federal Reserve pushback to Treasury and Congress**. His rhetoric has been clear; ‚Äòwe have done what we are going to do, for now, and the onus for a healthy economy is on the fiscal stimulus.  Our measures designed to be a temporary stopgap, not polic‚Äô Yet the treasury and congress haven‚Äôt done their part. But his response choices do exist; and are more subtly complex than it may seem.  Let's take a journey through QE, and what the options are at the FOMC.

The first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.

**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**
*Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)*
*Last year this time: 1.75%*
**Any likely changes?** Hell no
Good news is that the Fed rate is obviously not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--is also unlikely.  Not solely because of the fact that it's a tool to be saved for a much more distressed market, but because it would signal a level of panic that the Fed would see as a detrement to the markets, particularly heading into the new year.
**MM quote:**
>... the Fed will leave the Fed funds target rate at 0-0.25% next Wednesday, promising to keep it there until the goal of maximum employment and inflation being ‚Äúon track to moderately exceed 2% for some time‚Äù is met ‚Äì their ‚Äúdot‚Äù diagram will continue to suggest this won‚Äôt happen before 2023.

[MORE HERE](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/usd/2020/12/13/US-Dollar-Outlook-Hinges-on-Federal-Reserve-Interest-Rate-Decision.html)

**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**
*Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)*
This has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  More on this type of activity here [DD link], but the long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.
**Any likely changes?** Probably not.
Given that the stimulus talks are stalling for like the 70th time while COVID cases are rising and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking,  there *has* been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  The overall sentiment, however, is that its unlikely to see an expansion for the same reason we won't see a change to the Federal interest rate: the desire not to create panic at such a sensitive time for the markets.
**MM quote:**
>	They have to get incrementally more dovish next week...Increasing the size of QE might send a little more alarming signal than they would like to take at this moment.‚Äù

[MORE HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-could-do-at-its-policy-meeting-next-week.html)

**So, if these changes are unlikely, what are the options left, then?**  They are subtle, but important; two FOMC factors that may not make a huge splash in the news, but could make a huge splash in the markets.

**1) Tweaking which treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities:**
The Fed could decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could end up providing a fairly large boost to stonk buying without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There is chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and this move could do it.
**Is this likely to happen?** 50/50
Some market watchers think it will happen because the factors mentioned earlier necessitate it (stimulus deadlock, virus uptick, struggling jobs numbers).  Yes, there is a vaccine coming, but the market has to *survive* in the meantime, and a lot of factors are stacked against it.
**Do I think it will happen?**Probably not.  
I don‚Äôt think the Fed wants to roil the treasuries market around the holidays, AND would want to stay hands off with stimulus talks ongoing while this meeting is taking place‚Äîthe Fed wants, and needs, to put pressure on congress for fiscal stimulus and leaving the yield curve untouched will do that.  Any further yield curve tinkering will signal to congress that help is there for their precious stonks wiht or without the stimulus passing.  If stimmy talks fail again, though, I definitely think this could come to fruition at the January meeting.
MM quote:
>A number of economists believe that the Fed should tamp down on any further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve by shifting the focus of its purchases to longer-dated bonds from shorter-dated instruments.

**2) Outcome-based guidance:**
This term sounds like bullshit but it is not.  This essentially means ‚Äúthe Fed will peg QE measures 2021 to how the economy is performing, on this predetermined scale‚Äù  The reason it‚Äôs not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.
**Is this lilkely to happen?** Yes.  
Most market watchers are expecting some sort of firm guidance to show us where we could go in 2021.
**Do I think it will happen? ** Yes.  
I think, [especially after the Treasury started beef with the Fed by putting an end to critical crises-era programs ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/treasury-seeks-to-extend-some-emergency-fed-programs-but-end-others-including-main-street-facility.html), the Fed is going to pushback by tying the Fed‚Äô‚Äô programming to economic indicators which can be largely effected by fiscal stimulus.  There is more the Fed can do, as they‚Äô‚Äôe stated many times, but at this point our growing economic woes are self-inflicted, and I expect guidance to reflect that.
MM quote:
>We could see a change in guidance relating to the asset purchases, which currently stand at $80bn of Treasuries and $40bn of Mortgage Backed Securities each month. At present they merely comment that ‚Äúover coming months‚Äù the purchases will continue ‚Äúat least at the current pace‚Äù. Officials have hinted they could make the pace of purchases more conditional on economic conditions. 

[MORE HERE](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-what-to-expect-from-the-december-fomc-meeting/)

**Conclusions I‚Äôm drawing:**
I don‚Äôt think the Fed is offering shit in terms of solid market help through, really, the only potential way it would‚Äî‚Äîa shift into purchasing a larger amount of longer-dated maturities within the current 80B treasury purchase budget.  It seems like the market, from a lot of articles I‚Äôve read, is holding out hope on that (especially in light of worsening conditions), so if it doesn‚Äôt happen we definitely got a dip coming.

**I‚Äôm viewing the importance of this meeting in the context of several problematic outside factors‚Äîstimulus talks stalling, Brexit and the Europoors on they full Oliver Twist rn, and terrible job numbers likely coming this week.**  I know PFE was given the go-ahead this weekend, but I don‚Äôt have much confidence in that carrying us much past the likely green Monday with such a turbulent week ahead (my 367c 12/14 im bagholding certainly fucking hope so on the Monday part).

SPY is already unperforming by typical December standards, and certainly by the year‚Äôs insane standard. **So then, by my logic, market momentum truly becomes an issue of two factors: FOMC meeting results, and the stimulus talks going well.  I will be the first to admit that my optimism on the stimulus is seeming increasingly incorrect**, and I‚Äôm growing doubtful it will be finished next week‚Äîthough there will be lots of little meaningless ‚Äútalk‚Äú going well‚Äù pum‚Äùs.
*The questions is‚Äîwill‚ÄîPow and the FED use their big, swinging QE tools to save EOY market optimism during this FOMC meeting? For me, the signs point to no.*

**Positions**
I know I know, I literally just said I hate VIX and have broken up with it, but I took another look, and rethought about it‚Äôs purpose.  **I do believe by Tuesday, especially assuming we are green-ish or flat Monday, **there will be a spike in options premiums in preparation for the FOMC and Stimulus shenanigans.  That said, I will be keeping‚Äîbut trimming‚Äî my precious calls positions 

(**AAPL, TDOC, TOL, HPQ, TGT, WMT**) and adding quite a bit of these on **Monday EOD**

**VXX 1/15 20c**

It is a very long post but read until the end of the post as I give my price target for TESLA long-term and also what I think will happen in the next couple of weeks**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hey everyone and Welcome! This is a very long post just so you know but let‚Äôs go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.

So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.

The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the world‚Äôs regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.

Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.

Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.

Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.

Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.

My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more & more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.

The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Tesla‚Äôs.

I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.

You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.

This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses.

So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musk‚Äôs target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.

This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.

And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.

I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.

So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.

And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.

That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$

Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.

Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.

As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.

The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.

Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.

The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.

So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.

Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.

Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla don‚Äôt think at the old & traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they can‚Äôt get enough of this stock at the moment.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?

Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news & sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500.

The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range.

I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.

Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.

Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesn‚Äôt go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.

The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day.

So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

I have boring math that will give you a surge in your portfolio.  

If PLTR makes $0.09 a quarter (like last quarter) for the next three quarters, its EPS will be $0.36 - a forward PE of 77.  

But wait, they are growing like weeds and publicly signing millions.  So lets go out wild and say they earn $0.01 per share more per quarter going forward.  So its $0.09, $0.10, $0.11 and $0.12 - EPS of $0.42.  Suddenly it has a forward PE of 66.

Compared to the other growth names, forward PE doesn't sound bad at all as they continue to grow.  I see them at 55 at end of 2021 and 85 at end of 2022.  At end of 2023, beats 100.

Disclaimer, I am very old and very conservative in my portfolio._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSMC holds the Crown Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards. The only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is someserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here. I'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it during Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\_is\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)

As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.First, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ)

So what do we have here:

* "If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed."
* "This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here."
* "Current trajectory of the business does not look good."

Jesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?

TSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.One very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips.

Some of the major customers of TSMC are \[3\]:

* AMD
* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)
* Broadcom
* Marvell
* MediaTek
* Nvidia
* Qualcomm
* Xilinx

Soon Intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \[4\].

**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government is currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it "Cold War 2" \[7\]. There is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\_8YoJTU&ab\_channel=KoreanaJones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP_8YoJTU&ab_channel=KoreanaJones)

Well, shit. So here we are:

* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.
* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.
* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \[5\]
* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \[6\]
* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.
* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)
* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americansfor the survival of their nation.
* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.
* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a Dutch company in the EU. Unsurprisingly, EU has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a "crown jewel" for the EU and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.

So what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?The bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.

EDIT:

Yeah yeah, ASML is dutch not German. I fixed that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Gang Rise up, the War Has Only Just Begun üöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's Time to Pull the Plug on ChargePoint (SBE). The SBE SPAC Deal Is A Shit Deal. Hey Autists,

I've made a solid 15k from SBE calls back in November (bought in at 20 and sold at 28), but like most SPAC investors involved with this stock, I had no idea what I was buying into. This SPAC deal, like many of them, is designed to let the insiders unload their shares on the retail investors. The fact that its trading on a 5x multiple before the reverse merger has even occurred is absurd. The good news for you is that you can profit off of wall street's greed, as this is getting closer to tanking every single day.

First off, a large majority of investors have yet to realize that SBE only represents a 10.3% equity stake in ChargePoint, Inc. It's important to look at page 33 of the investor deck: [https://chargepoint.ent.box.com/s/gm82ewxmfoffwa2kgd7m5773k4u8o9k2#33](https://chargepoint.ent.box.com/s/gm82ewxmfoffwa2kgd7m5773k4u8o9k2#33)

The fair share value of those SBE shares is easy to calculate, they're collectively worth 247.7 million (2.40 billion enterprise value \* .103) divided by 31.4 million, which leaves you with **$7.87 / share**. That's the actual value each SBE share after the merger, and it's trading at $38.00 a share right now. You have to understand that 31.9 million shares is nothing, because there's another 269 million shares held by insiders that will get unloaded when the lock-up period ends (6 months after the reverse merger). If the insiders sold 15% of their stake (which is likely to be even more), that's a greater number of shares being sold at once than SBE's entire current stake in ChargePoint.

This isn't entirely speculative, look at the price of [SBE.WS](https://SBE.WS) (the warrants). They've completely lagged behind SBE's price growth, at $11.00/warrant. The exercise price is $11.50/share two weeks after the reverse merger, so investors are valuing SBE at **less than $22.50 post merger.** I firmly believe this will be trading at less than $15/share post merger.

The SBE/ChargePoint reverse merger was supposed to happen on 12/15/2020 (this upcoming Tuesday), and that was silently pushed back on 12/04/2020 with an S-4 amendment to a blanket date in 2021. There has been no notification to investors that there was a pushback in the reverse merger date, so I loaded up on puts on Friday as this is bearish news for the stock.

ChargePoint has even pointed on on page 166 of their original S-4 that their revenue is declining and will continue to decline until 2022, which is found no where on their investor deck. "For the remainder of fiscal year 2021, ChargePoint expects revenue to continue declining year-over-year given the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic." ([https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-032076/fs42020\_switchbackenergy.htm](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-032076/fs42020_switchbackenergy.htm#166))

ChargePoint is projecting a $30 million dollar profit (for the first time) in 2024, and because SBE only has a 10.3% stake in ChargePoint, that means a hefty $3 million dollar reward for SBE shareholders (among 31.4 million shares), a mere $0.09 EPS in three years from now. This is a shitty short term prospect, and a shitty long term prospect.

I drive a Model 3, and I use ChargePoint once a week (check my post history). ChargePoint bulls are pointing at President Elect Biden's charging infrastructure plan, you know, those 500,000 highway charging stations. It's a great idea, but it doesn't benefit ChargePoint all that much. ChargePoint is the leader in level 2 charging (6 kWh, slow charging), not level 3, EVGo, ElectrifyAmerica, and several others are dominating the level 3 charging space, and they're far more likely to win those highway charging station contracts.

What people don't realize about the EV charging space is that the margins are incredibly slim. I spend $8/week to use a ChargePoint, and a large majority of that goes to the owner of the ChargePoint for electricity use, so ChargePoint only makes $4/month or less from me and I'm a frequent user. Most people charge their EVs from home, and many of them come with a level 2 charger with the vehicle (Teslas do at least). If you're holding this stock long term, good luck to you.

Positions: **$20 12/18 Puts (Speculative)**

Buy puts before the reverse merger, no news yet on the date however.

I grew up in China for the first 10 yrs of my life so you know I‚Äôm not fucking with you. Anyway, he told me that his company (publicly traded) used to treat auditors like celebrities whenever they were about to release earnings: 5 stars hotels, women, FUCK ton of booze. 

They‚Äôd take them out to Karaoke and get them so fucked up that they would be way too hungover the next day to ask hard questions or even look at the tedious shit. 

Moral of the story, don‚Äôt trust any Chinese companies except BABA and JD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Made one tendie and now I am a greedy autist Me and my dad started a trading account together.

Background on my dad: He has worked hard labor most of his life and has little to show for it. I have been sharing my leveraged internet money positions during this bull run and after securing heavy gains on my small investments, he is ready to give trading a go.

Him and I have never traded a single stock before but he heard about the AirBNB IPO and wanted to get his feet wet, but he is not so good with technology so he sent me 450 to go all in on the IPO. I set up a Robinhood acct and got $450 BP.

Unfortunately I don't know how IPO's work so none of my $68-70 orders got filled in the order book.

I read an article friday morning about Disney releasing a new streaming service and with all the vaccine news, I figured their theme parks would see some of that hype roll over. I honestly had no idea what I was doing and didn't even know the announcement would have such an impact.

So I bought a couple of $180 calls on Disney expiring 12/18 when the stock was at $156. Within a few hours Disney was at 170+ my $450 turned into $950, I tried to sell, but robinhood has some sort of "pattern day trade protection" that kept me from selling the peak euphoria. Ended up selling 1/3 of my position and the account is sitting at $755 now.

Disney ended the day at 175.72 and I made almost 70% gains on my entire portfolio in one day. But I wasn't happy, I want more.

Before I tell you about my degen decisions this weekend, just know that I have more than enough money saved to pay my dad back if I lose it all. Anyways, while the markets have been closed I have been piling my gains into OTM calls wherever I can find an opening. I have been scanning the call orderbooks for any calls that seem out of place. If I see a 0.05c call in the order book when the calls above and below are .25-.50c I have been submitting the orders. (I am aware that most of these will probably not get filled, but I think if they do, it's a way way trip to tendie town.)

Doesn't it make sense that these calls will rise in price to correlate with their placement in the orderbook?

ANYWAYS, it's been done. I have OTM orders for puts for TSLA expiring Jan (crash after SP listing?,) calls for TSLA exp 12/18 (pump ahead of sp listing), calls for Darden exp Jan (earnings this week, mom and pop restaurants are closing left and right, and Yard House is delicious,) Pfizer calls exp Jan (Vax priced in, but who cares,) Calls on Trane exp Mar (Those vaccines need to stay cool, and I'm bearing on Chinese suppliers in US markets,) Shorts on AMC exp March (They need $750 million or they are about to Bankrupt,) Shorts on Peloton exp Jan (Gyms are about to reopen and Apple is going to steal the digital exercise market,) Calls on Blackrock and Mircostrategy exp 12/18 (Reasons) Calls for Delta exp FEB (I reckon airlines will pump a bit on Vaccine news, and Delta is world class IMO)

I will keep you posted.

EDIT: This order will not put me and my dad on the streets if it fails. My dad is a really laid back guy. He own's a house and recently retired. When I was 14 my dad used to take me to the horse races and let me pick the horses, whether we won or lost, we still had fun because were were communicating and doing an activity together. This is just another version of that.

Amazing buying opportunity this Monday!

Hello guys, if you Look at Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) they had a flight test yesterday that was ‚Äòaborted‚Äô because the computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection. As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. After this they landed safely in Spaceport America. According to their Twitter statement they are fixing and analysing what went wrong and they are preparing for the second test flight which will be ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.

After these news I believe the stock will drop around 25% because paper hands must have gotten scared or lost faith in this company, therefore, this is the best time to buy calls or shares and keep these for the long term.

Remember that Virgin Galactic is one of the few companies that could have a massive growth potential in the future. They will be the first company to enter and dominate the ‚ÄòSpace Tourism‚Äô market with few competition. 

If the next test flight goes well and they reach space the share price is going to Mars, they have contracts with nasa and they are working in other experiments like the jet that would take you from London to New York in two hours. üìà‚úÖ

For those who don‚Äôt know Virgin Galactic is a company that wants to bring its customers to space and make it possible for regular people be able to see our home planet from a new perspective. The price of each ticket costs over $250,000 and over 600 people have already booked their place including famous celebrities like Leonardo Dicaprio and Justin Bieber.

As Warren Buffet says:‚Äô Buy the f*cking dip‚Äô

Recommended action: Long term calls or shares are the way to go. Remember to do your own DD before options or shares.

GME is a B&M primary business, first and foremost. It operates mainly in the US, though it also has retail stores in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. They used to be wildly popular back in the day, but have seen rapid decline since the digitization era has come and GME for the most part hasn't been adapting as it should have been.   


This brings us to today, where the share price has been averaging down for years, until mid-August this year when we got the news of the [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-surges-after-microsoft-partnership-announcement-2020-10-08#:~:text=GME%2C%20%2D5.74%25%20gained%2044,end%20and%20in%2Dstore%20operations), which sent the price to tendie-town for those who got in early. However, based on purely DCF, a fair value for the stock would be around 22 USD. Way higher than what it's now, and that's also the difference between Burry and Cohen imo. Burry invested purely on the fair value for GME, while Cohen has different intentions (more on that later).

Now, a partnership is great, but it won't keep them afloat forever. They NEED to change their boomer mentality and start getting digitized. Gaming is a booming sector, [with insane growth YOY.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20game%20market,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027.&text=The%20rising%20inclination%20from%20physical,on%20hardware%20compatibility%20and%20efficiency) They need to capitalize on this or they'll flicker out eventually because someone else came around and filled the void. 

This is where Ryan Cohen comes in. No need to introduce him, this guy has been mentioned enough, founded CHEWY made millions, etc. What hasn't been sent home enough, is that he has vision. He knows what people want, how they want to be treated as customers ([which is in part why CHWY has such good reputability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/05/23/chewys-customers-love-them-and-heres-why/?sh=58b595244b7f)). 

What the gaming industry lacks is a centralized point that makes people go "Oh yeah, I need this or that game, let's go to Gamestop for that" There really isn't that one name for people. It used to BE Gamestop with them even now still being the largest gaming retailer in America. But they're but a shadow of what they have been. 

Now if anyone has been able to follow me through my ramblings, Ryan Cohen has in front of him an opportunity to pull GME up from the mud and reveal a diamond. Because that what GME is. A diamond in the rough, and no one's noticed, or bothered to check it out. 

Now I don't know how, or when exactly, there are plenty of other posts that go into the when and how Cohen will take over, but all I do know is this:

\-He bought up 9.98% of the shares outstanding (massive position)

\-He ([or his lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/)) wrote an unusually aggressive letter to the BoD to change pretty massively. 

\-He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't like to half-ass investments if he ["believes in the company"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJdZPTjq274). 

&#x200B;

What does this say for me? That he believes in the company, not so much in the current way that its heading (hence the letter). His stake in the company tells me he's not just a friendly passer-by telling them to look-up because a meteorite is about to smash into them. No, he's putting his foot in the door so that he can then open it wide and let in some fresh air (himself/his team). 

Not only would it change the entire company in a good way, it would make any sort of valuation unpredictable taking into account future potential. 

Add on to this situation that GME is so heavily shorted, and this makes for a SUPER interesting play, if not long-term, at the very least short-term, because of the short squeeze that would occur because of this. And if Cohen takes over, long term prospects are probably higher than whatever we get from the squeeze. 

I don't know if much of what I said made sense, but here you go anyway. My 2 cents.

QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.

So let‚Äôs look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  

According to this source

[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)

‚ÄúVolkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year.‚Äù *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* 

The same article states the following, ‚ÄúQuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management & Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**‚Äù

So we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Here‚Äôs the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in‚Ä¶

**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell off‚Äôs happen.  

According to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, ‚ÄúPursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the ‚ÄúFiling Deadline‚Äù), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensington‚Äôs sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.‚Äù

Source:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm

Let‚Äôs break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because I‚Äôm retarded, why else am I here?).

There is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day ‚Äúcountdown‚Äù only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a ‚Äúregistration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares‚Äù. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word ‚Äúregister‚Äù for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once they‚Äôre registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  

‚ÄúSince this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC.¬†**However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**.‚Äù *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*

Source: 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).

‚ÄúOnce the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.‚Äù

[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)

You might ask ‚ÄúIs there a lock up for these PIPE shares?‚Äù And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, it‚Äôs merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  

However, from the same SEC document it states ‚ÄúKensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.‚Äù

So, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. I‚Äôm not going to talk down to you autists, even though you‚Äôre retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it can‚Äôt be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now that‚Äôs a big IF.

Let‚Äôs take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  

From the same SEC document‚Ä¶

‚Äú‚ÄòPIPE‚Äô means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500¬†million**, in a private placement.‚Äù

So what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?

Well according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)

Their outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QS‚Äôs shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.

Now the question is‚Ä¶.are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QS‚Äôs current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shares‚Ä¶would you take that profit?

Not only that, but the discussion of the ‚ÄúSPAC bubble‚Äù has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPAC‚Äôs have been huge this year, and the ‚ÄúSPAC bubble‚Äù is the fear of overvaluing company‚Äôs that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  

Do you think Fidelity hasn‚Äôt heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they won‚Äôt take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.

Now, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote 

‚ÄúHowever, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.‚Äù

In regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows‚Ä¶.I sure as fuck don‚Äôt, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesn‚Äôt matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.

Now, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  

In conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  

TLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies

This is a great trade, taken at face value, written after watching 3 hours of documentaries on the pros of psychedelics

Somewhere around 22 may 2019, these were indeed trading around the $1 per range.

My broker gives closing bid/ask, so I‚Äôm guessing these could have even hit 40-50 cents throughout the week. That would put the $460 trade just shy of $2M if all the stars aligned, not just a few.

\[img\][https://i.imgur.com/79kXwjV.png\[/img\]](https://i.imgur.com/79kXwjV.png[/img])

According to his screenshot, the original trade breaks down like this:

Contracts - 4 Calls, expiring 15 January 2021

Strike - $680 (appx 370% on current weekly price range)

Cost Average - $1.15

Cost of trade - $460

End of August, 5:1 split

Readjusted Values Post-split

Contracts - 20, same expiration date

4 \* 5 = 20

Strike - $136

680 / 5 = 136

Cost Average - $0.23

1.15 / 5 = .23

Current cost of contract - $463.35

So, $463.35 - $0.23 = $463.12

Current cost of contract - price paid per contract

$463.12 \* 100 \* 20 = $926,240

Current cost of contract \* leverage \* # of contracts

In closing, well played. But imagine if he yolo‚Äôd like a true autist.

If he found a seller willing to write $25k worth, easy number based off PDT minimum, the autist would be sitting on $50M. Because, that‚Äôs how math works.

Commence slow clap._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA to the moon! Part 2 (the DD) I'm making this post because I'm tired of the misinformation and lack of understanding. So? Time to break out the big boy thesis: Tesla is going to the moon,or atleast minimum $700.

Please see my first post about what I'm doing--> [TSLA to the moon! Part 1(the non DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbyju1/tsla_to_the_moon_part_1_the_non_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (if you curious)

**Fact: Tracking & benchmarked Funds have to purchase over 100million of tesla shares.**

\-to help illustrate this point see rob's video [Tesla Daily](https://youtu.be/QgCt2LRUj0k?t=248) it illustrates the need for shares, how many, and why exactly the price isnt going to change the number much. To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.

**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.

"Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETF¬¥s, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETF¬¥s ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  "

I previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies.

**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.

" With Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the company‚Äôs value. " [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)

Also, NZ has no covid so can shop safely without masks etc). 

Anyway, I think I see exactly what Cohen sees in GME; it's a gaming culture brand for consoles and PCs that also serves fandom merch. It just works cause there's nothing like it in the market. It's a fun place and a good brand. It's one of the only places where everything is kinda fun and as a huge pokemon fan, im not really served otherwise except for target clones which draws the life out of you shopping in. 

The good news was the console sales. I chatted to a rep acting interested in a ps5. She told me there is a backlog of PS5s and Xboxs. NZ will prob get 10k max at EB games then will have to wait for the next shipment. I cannot order a PS5 until January and even then March and April is more likely. Shit is real. And EB Games (GME) is seen as a market leader in the NZ market. She said xbox didnt even have a date in nz. Gotta love hype.

Anyway, I guess since cash is the definition of liquid, I find myself buying contracts that I have no idea why they let me go that deep. I have 2k liquid with a risk of 15k one way and 10k the other, on what is basically at this point an unbalanced iron condor where I entered the wings and added more tranches of contracts in dips and at peaks. In technical speak I did short call spreads and short put spreads. 

But this is what's nuts about that, do you really not have a general idea where currency is going? It's like gold, except gold takes a shitload of buypower and let's go over to investing. Fuck that. I got 84 contracts tying up 10.5 million euros to dollars futures tied up with 2k. I'm looking to triple my money within 27 days. I'll probably have paper hands in 25 and bail out at 75%. And I may buy and sale the whipsaw, nothing a little day trade will hurt if you keep it down to a few. But as it creeps up they give more buy power and I keep leveraging more and more. Dangerous.

Turned 1 into 2.5 doing same thing with December euro futures, played the game lost a little on stock options, spent a fortune in commissions on euros futures, and I think today liquidity is about 1850.

Does anybody got something that leverages harder than this? 

The risk is insane for the buy power. I've had many days of 10% gains. But the ebb flow of a month is a hell of a thing.

If the risk wasn't 25k, (I guess it can't go both ways) so max loss is 15k?, I wouldn't say this is wsb material. But I am basically all In, leveraged to the nuts. This is a yolo with probabilities of (4 spreads) 71% 74% 77% 81%. Probably lose my ass.

* I have 12.2k account balance
*  I am trading APPL
* AAPL is trading at 122.00/share

&#x200B;

If i wanted to do normal covered calls for this week, I'd do something like the following:  


* Buy 100 shares of AAPL at current price (122)
* sell a 18DEC 124C (current price 1.25)
* assuming AAPL doesn't move above 124, profit $125 from the 12.2k investment 

&#x200B;

If i am understanding poor mans covered calls correctly, I'd do something like the following:  


* Buy 4 16JUL2021 100C at current price (27.3)
* sell 4  18DEC 127C at current price using long calls as collateral at current price 0.5
* assuming AAPL doesn't moon this week, short calls expire worthless, profit $200 from the 12.2k investment 

&#x200B;

Now I know I have to be missing something here,  because this seems like it's just too easy as long as you're not doing this with the likes of GME and NKLA. The only downside seems to be if there's a significant crash in the underlying (eg AAPL suddenly drops to 110 and doesnt recover before the long calls expire), you're effectively making the % returns based on the premium of the long call rather than the actual share price (0.5/27.3 vs 1.25/124). 

&#x200B;

so even if I can afford 100 shares of a company to do covered calls, why would I do that instead of PMCC? what am I missing?

Edit: gotcha. Seems like the downside is you lose the safety net of traditional wheeling where if the underlying tanks enough, you can still have shares vs PMCC potentially getting wiped out on both legs if the underlying crashes hard enough._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CHEGG TO ZERO -- $CHGG PUTS Chegg is booming lately from people using their educational resources while taking classes from home. 10B market cap, 20EV/sales, 50%+ growth rate.. huge growth potential? not for long.

So Chegg is basically helping people cheat in school...great right? but in there T&C there's a catch. They have rights to give YOUR INFORMATION TO YOUR SCHOOL upon request. There's been tons of students this year who have been kicked out of their programs just for having a Chegg account or having access to certain documents with test answers.

I'd be more ok with it if the schools were paying for this information but free security breaches? cmon weak business model

Chegg users- anyone know anything about this? also use a vpn and fake name and you'll be fine lol

&#x200B;

TLDR: Chegg is helping students cheat in school but telling the schools which students are cheating. Snitches get stitches lets run this stock to the floor

Whilst some [insert insult of your choice] on WSB have been telling you to cut your losses and sell you shares, these institutions have been accumulating GME like it's pre-2020 TSLA. **I think they can feel it too.**

Ford? Volkswagen? No. Tesla!

No other car company has a monopoly on an entire planetary economy. Think about it: millions of future captive consumers who can only buy Tesla cars. Everyone on Mars will need to commute with a car because there is no air so you can't just walk around or take public transport. Also, gas cars don't work on Mars because the lack of oxygen makes combustion impossible. Plus, the 2018 Falcon Heavy flight that launched a Tesla into space proved that there is market demand for watching Teslas get launched into space. Every time they launch one they can make money by putting commercials on the YouTube livestream. That's basically software as a service, which means that Tesla should be valued like a software company. Don't forget that the Martian government will give huge subsidies to EV's because Elon will be dictator for life and he supports EV's.

One of the simplest and most reliable investment strategies is to just dump your money in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500. To date, it averages a 7-8% annual growth rate. Not knowing much about the technical things of finance, why wouldn't I put my money in a 3x ETF like SPXL that tracks the S&P 500?

Every website that I go to says that it is stupid to do this, but I still don't understand why. If I go long-term say 30 years and put $100 in the ETF each month, I shouldn't have to worry about any downturns. With SPXL the average annual return for the past 5 years is 28%. Using a simple investment calculator it says that I should have $7.9 million after that time frame.

If you wonder why the years 1920-1929 are romanticized in our cultural history as one big playful, perpetual party, it‚Äôs because people felt they were overdue for enjoying life to the fullest, having just been dealt a bad hand of too much death and disease.
