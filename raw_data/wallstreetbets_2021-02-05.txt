Holding this to the peak took 💎 ✋ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why the SEC Short Interest report on the 9th is already priced in and we will see the squeeze next week 🚀🚀 Everyone is waiting for the [SEC Short Interest Report](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) report coming out on February 9th. However, that report will not be accurate according to current situation.

**Reason:
1: The settlement date for that report was on January 29th. Meaning, anything from the Feb 1 til now is not included.


So what happened leading up to the 29th? On the 28th, Robinhood and other brokers restricted purchasing of shares. Collusion or not, it sent the price plumetting to sub 200. Situation was great for the shorts to cover their positions a bit and make their report kosher. Price recovered a bit on Friday after some purchasing was allowed. However, by this time, the shorts already fixed their books to not get in trouble.


2: Now that the 29th has come and gone and the hedgies had something to hand over to the SEC, they started doubling down. Starting from Monday, EVERYONE noticed the aggressive short ladder attack and more shorts were being done.


3: Prices have plunged from $325 close on the 29th to $53.50 by close Thursday 2/4. The reason why they can do whatever they want is that the next settlement date for the report is on Friday 2/12. So the real important date is the 12th.


**What to expect


1: The report on the 9th will be good to please the SEC. Everything will point to 0 manipulation. Media and Jimmy Chill will be jerking off to the news and telling your wife to leave you.


2a: The report on the 9th will cause FUD and drive prices lower because everyone and the media will think that you apes are retarded. Shorts will cover and get out of their positions easily as price has dipped way back down.


**2b: If 2a does not happen and if everyone has diamond hands, expect 2/10 - 2/12 where the short squeeze happens. Why those dates? Because the next settlement date for the SEC report is the 12th and the hedgies have to make their report whole like how your wife's boyfriend makes her.

The faster we can understand what power we will have as retail investors, the better. I think we would all benefit from putting these together. I know this is WSB, but let's face the music here. We've become #55 on the list of largest subreddits, many people here may already be professionals in their field, and I think it would be worth our time as a community to hold weekly events as a way to keep people interested in the stock markets. For many of us, myself included, this is our first experience purchasing our own stocks and building our own portfolios. Some of us may still be leery or polarized from recent events, but I think it's important for the future of our economy that we, (and you, the professionals) have a vested interest in each-other and a working friendship. The curtain is definitely there, but I think even from a common person standpoint, we all would stand to benefit from listening to you guys. Things like stock analysis, reading charts and how to understand them, even basic indicators would be really cool to discuss with a professional.

We all have a voice here, and upon reading (and posting) it's come to my attention that we need to take our opportunity and make something of it, rather than be a, "mob of retards to fear". If we take the initiative to learn, we will be respected and when we catch something like this in the future, it will be a done deal. No, "Reddit children said this" or the like, fighting media every step of the way.

In no way do I think this would change the state of the sub. In fact, I argue that WSB would have more loss porn than ever before. Studies show that those who believe they are educated are more likely to take risks. Frankly, losses just come with the territory here on r/wallstreetbets, and I would hope the moderators see this as a chance to build something beyond their wildest dreams of , "just a movie deal". It's easy to see the loss porn, but often times people have reasoning for how they got there. Even having something as simple as requiring an explanation on a post of loss porn would be nice, even if it's literally, "I just felt like it was going up".  People didn't show up to lose money on purpose, but it's nice to have a nugget of feedback if these people are honest with themselves enough to post their losses, or a way to look at previous AMA's and see something like, " What did so and so say about bear crosses again?"

Sorry for this  long winded post, but if this concept already exists elsewhere, I'd really like to be a part of it. Retail investors are the future and I want to be as educated as possible via books, interviews, and what I can find online.

Some people are pointing out that I may have made a mistake in how I interpreted the information I posted earlier today that is now trending here, but I want to be clear that I \*want\* to learn. If you saw it as a shitpost, and you're a financial professional, I'd like to hear you out.

**WE LIKE THE STOCK**

**💎🙌**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thank you guys for fighting this battle and inspiring change. I’ve been poor most of my life. I’ve always heard about getting into the stock market and making more money off it. When I have had money, I’ve had no faith in myself so I’ve never entered the market. That changed on January 8th of this year. I finally entered the market through Robinhood with my measly $700. 

Things started out slow up until this past week. I live in Northern California and there was a massive snowstorm here that knocked out power on Monday. This week, I have power through a generator. But I missed one of the biggest moments in U.S. history being without power from Monday until Saturday. I don’t own AMC nor GME stock but I do hold Express that was also affected by what RH did.

I was so excited when I first got power to see that my portfolio nearly doubled in that time. And express was a big part of that. I then felt sadness seeing my value drop when I heard what was going on. I wanted to sell my stock. But then Reddit suggested this sub to me and I read up on what’s been going on and you all have inspired me to hold on to my measly 20 shares. I will not let them get away with market manipulation. I will not be controlled. Many of you out there will never be mentioned by your usernames in the media or anything like that. Many of you are worth 5-8+ digits. But let me tell you. You inspire us poor people to stand with you and to fight for what’s right. Remember, you guys are fighting a war. Only this war isn’t being fought with bullets and blood, but with paper and electricity. You all have tons of poor people out there rooting for you guys. Stick it to the fat cats. You all have a once in a lifetime chance to go down in history for changing not just the USA, but the world right now. Don’t surrender. Remember that this battle is for the future. For your kids, friends, cousins, nieces, nephews, and so on.

I haven’t been here that long but you guys have given me a reason to care and a cause to stand for.

Hello there fellow degenerates. I know everyone still has their panties in a bunch over $GME and $AMC, but shockingly there are other stocks in the market. Before you rip off my head, just hear me out.

**$FUBO.**

Fubo TV is a streaming television service that allows you to cut the cord when it comes to cable. It provides over 250+ television channels and boasts perhaps one of the largest collections of sports channels. Apes from all over can watch their favorites from football to cricket (I hear that's popular with some crayon eaters abroad).

Now, you're probably thinking, "So what? There are tons of streaming platforms out there, the market is dominated by established providers like Netflix and Hulu.....and now I'm bored because I have the attention span of a goldfish." Well boys and girls, the thing that makes this turd so shiny is that last month **$FUBO** just bought Vigtory - a sportsbook platform - which they plan to use to establish a revenue stream. When I heard they were creating another way for a retard like myself to risk money, I felt a tiny tingle in my flesh flavored bean bag. Other sports betting companies like Penn Gaming and Draftkings are trading higher comparatively, and streaming platforms like ROKU are on another planet. This thing has room for growth.

Now the icing on the cake is that this news didn't come out until AFTER a large number of individuals decided to short **$FUBO** stock. It has a 73% short interest float since January 15th. Short interest volume was 31% today. So this stock does have the potential for a bit of the ole squeeeeeze. But that shouldn't be the reason you retards invest in this company. By **$FUBO** combining sports streaming and online gambling they could become leaders in the sports betting arena. **$FUBO** predicts a full launch of the platform before the end of 2021.

TLDR: **$FUBO** will be the new crack for sports betting addicts.

(GME) Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Hi retards, 

I've had my laughs from the GME pump and dump, trying to get back to making money now. Anyone still chanting diamond hands while they cry, fully clothed, in their parent's master bath tub while licking a photo a KFC bucket is officially excluded from this discussion. 

I have been on $AMD since around mid-2017, when the Ryzen hype was getting started (who the fuck you think started it). Let me tell you why now is actually a decent time to get involved: 

1. You're retarded, and financial strategy isn't your strength the way eating a jar of mayonnaise is. 
2. AMD has done everything they ever said they were going to do, including snatching the crown for single threaded performance from Intel. 
3. AMD's desktop, server, and mobile CPUs are industry leading products that are being sold above the MSRP for the first time in my memory. 
4. AMD's GPU lineup is more scarce than even NVIDIA's stuff (Performance in gaming is a wash)
5. AMD is currently valued \~$100 billion
6. AMD became profitable about a year ago, and wall street has been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but LISA FUCKING SU NEVER TAKES HER SHOES OFF. Pretty sure mama su bae sleeps in a pantsuit. 

So, it seems like you missed out, huh? Feeling a little down and out? Your wife's boyfriend ate all your popsicles?

Good news. Gospel, really. AMD's run is only half over. The other players in the space ($NVDA and $INTC) are both losing market share to AMD at a rapid rate. The thing is, due to legacy machines existing, and old people thinking computers run on ravioli, almost none of the market has made a CPU purchase until NOW. 

I'm talking about schools, corporations, POS, all that shit. Server farms. Government offices. They're all still running legacy Intel chips from 2012. Anyway, just saying that the growth (astonishing rate of 45% YoY for like 3 years) that $AMD has seen in revenue and EPS - that growth - will continue, and might actually accelerate this quarter, definitely going to pump after Q2 ER. 

Just look at the market cap of Intel ($260 billion last I gave a flying fuck). AMD is a more valuable company long term. They make better products. They attract better talent. They are smarter about who they work with (they were the first major partner of TSMC, now APPLE and INTEL are trying to squeeze in and suck the tit). They love enthusiasts. They are agile. 

And they are at the tippity top of the mountain, but they're only half way up. Think about it. 

I won't stop betting on AMD until their market cap is AT LEAST 50% of INTC. should be around $120 per share. My position is almost all shares right now, with a lonely $95 call expiring 3/12. Gonna give him some friends pretty soon.

Head to the casino every weekend and drink heavy, but make sure you can pay your bills too. I’m down 0.02 on my gambling money but I’m up on my boring mid and large cap retirement account. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying and hold a company for years if you think the long term profits are there. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a wad of cash on a rumor and a dream to see if you can get mad gainz and collect those tendies. 

It’s probably not a great idea to jump headlong off a cliff without a parachute, and you’re ostensibly doing the same thing if you go 100% in on GME, or anything else, because you’re easily swayed by internet peer pressure. FOMO is not a good reason to set your bill paying money on fire.

I have been looking for a long term hold and I think I found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the 
hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.

Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. It also has had a good consolidation in the last week so no is a great time to buy.

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.

If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.

NIO Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. 

My bull case....🚀🚀

EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.

Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.

That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.

Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. 

Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries. 

They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.

NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. 

Cameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Damn. What a fucked up world eh guys? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Doubled down on AMC. Holding the fucking line. Fuck the SEC and fuck the establishment _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So when the price goes up like a rocket they stop us from buying. And when they go down they won’t let us short it. Yet in both instances hedge funds get to do both. Retail sorta like setup to fail? FYI I’m a day trader so it is what it is. Go long on the way up and short on the way down. We just ride the big waves that the HFs make.

In this case my concern is with the brokers who are here to ‘protect’ retail yet all I see is preventing retail from making gains when the trends are very obvious, whereas big money has made heaps from this guaranteed short once they stopped retail from purchasing.

1. How is he supposed to exit at his break even if he can't set a sale price high enough? Obviously he wanted profits but he can't even set a profitable limit sell on GME. 


2. Why in the fuck can be not sell at whatever price he wants??


3. Are there any big boy brokers that let you set whatever limit order you want?


4. Why does it burn when I pee?

Profits from AMC calls turned into ten more on TD. Fastened my seatbelt, expected liftoff, got cucked by RH instead. Cried. Jerked off into a crusty sock.

Got paid today and bought five more. Because I like the stock.

These shares will one day sell for no less than four figures a piece, whether by me or by my future grandchildren avenging me with the next squeeze in 2099. Never surrender.

PS. let's please stop setting stupid ass deadlines for when we think this is going to pop off. I've seen "TOMORROW IS DEFINITELY THE DAY" posted every single day since last Thursday. These posts have been correct 0/6 times. Stop it. Tomorrow (well, Monday) is NOT "definitely the day," and all you're doing is playing with people's expectations and emotions, while the weaker among us become more likely to turn into paper-handed scabs because they feel deceived and disheartened. This is either going to happen or it won't, and we don't know when exactly it will trigger. We don't actually fucking know anything, we can barely read. So keep it simple: just hold your damn shares until we're all either rich or dead. Be patient. Let go of your fear of bagholding. Become one with the bag. It's not that bad - I'm still carrying my ACB shares from fucking 2013. If you lose money here, it may be your first time, but it won't be your last unless you're a giant bitch. You'll live. And you'll make money on other trades. Maybe.

PSPS. Stop screaming "mArkEt mAniPuLaTioN" every time something happens that you don't understand, like AMC/GME trading as a basket (which is largely caused by a phenomenon called "apes buy the same stock, apes sell the same stock, algorithms catch on and daytrade accordingly"). You sound like the prehistoric retards who thought thunderstorms meant God was mad at us because somebody fucked a goat.

See you autists on the moon. 💎🙌🚀

some serious ones.

I know you say you can't read, but here it goes.

The last few weeks has been... lets say interesting.

Some of you mfers won it all, and some of you retards are left holding nothing but body bags.

Some made their first trade ever, got screwed real good, scared and pulled out of this world forever.

Others got bit by the bug and will try new moves to gamble away their fortune.

Some of you got out just in time with enough $ for a lifetime, and some will never recover.

That's how this game is. There is no mercy. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

Some played it well, some got carried away.

WSB is all about lossporn, fantastic memes, ballsy hits and the occational riches, so all is good.

And a big fucking thank you to the mods!



But some of you apes, are just to good to be true.

Please,  buy GME, AMC and all other memestocks as much as you want, please spend  your entire savings, please borrow money from your mothers boyfriend, extend your mortgage, sell your dog, Toyota Corolla  or your mouth on the corner below a GMEposter on the side of the  road for more stocks. Good for you!

But we dont care.

And that is the point.

Its time to move shop.

Move  far away with your HoLDiN TiLL I'm Dead, BuY The DIps, short ladder,  screw HF, and the other new words you learned a week ago.

Please bring your rockets with you, shuw them up your asses and fly to the fucking moon where the god damn gorillas can fist you dry. Good for you!

As  far as WSB are concerned, this run is over. It was fun and it was the  greatest play there has ever been, but for us, it is over.

There are dedicated subs for you gaping assholes. I can suggest [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), [r/AMCstock](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCstock/) or even [r/Bondage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bondage/).

We want our sub back, and you are no longer invited unless you listen more, and talk less.

Did limitations affect the price? Sure. But now they're lifted and nothing changed.

SUPER AUTIST MOMENT INCOMING:

Had two GME $115 calls 1/29. Sold one for 20k midday Friday and held the other til 3:58. As I go to sell in etrade power on my computer (in portfolio view), it times me out for inactivity before I could sell before expiration. I had been clicking around so not sure why. I immediately sign back in and go to sell the last one I had. I hit trade from my portfolio and send submit the order. I am amped that I got another 25k more at the end of the day....

Well, to my surprise, when you open a trade order FROM YOUR FUCKING PORTFOLIO it automatically goes to BUY instead of SELL. (WHY THE FUCK DOES IT FUNCTION LIKE THAT IN PORTFOLIO VIEW WHEN I CAN OPEN A QUOTE FOR A BUY) Therefore, I ended up BUYING a second $115c 1/29 with 30 seconds left in the market. Immediately after I noticed, I was on the phone with etrade for 3 hours on Friday while having a panic attack. They said they won't know what happens til Monday. I look Monday and they exercise the calls for way above market value (217ish a share). Its Monday morning and now own 240 shares.

At this point, my etrade account says my cash is -$20k (owed to etrade via margin). I go to sell at market open to make up that 20k and hold the rest but it says if I sold those newly acquired shares, I'd get a 90 day ban since those shares/cash hasn't processed yet. Since I don't want to get locked out of my account for three months, I have to sit on those shares until Tuesday. Get an email Tuesday morning saying the money is due TUESDAY!

Well, as you know, it drops almost $200 a share into Tuesday and I essentially sold for a loss at $120 a share. I still have 60 shares left over and they are certainly not doing well either. Would have loved to use the money to tip some of my favorite local businesses a grand here and there but instead, just gonna stuff my face with comfort food.

Thats it boys, let me have it. Still holding my 60 with diamond hands because 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TLDR - Waited for last second Friday to sell my 1/29 $115 call. E Trade logs me out for inactivity. Log back in with 30 seconds left, think I SOLD my call. Turns out E Trade auto populates a trade as a BUY. They exercise with margin -20k. Won't let me sell without 90 day ban Monday. Wake up to email saying I owe them the money Tuesday. Have to sell at $120ish.. Could of had $50k, have nothing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on GameStop's New Hires So, as many of us know, and many of y’all don’t. Gamestop was a VALUE play. A Deep Fucking one at that… why do you think DFV didn’t sell? The squeeze was the cherry-on-top. Gamestop is currently undergoing a complete transformation with Ryan Cohen and his chewy boys, Chris Davis, Reggie Fils-Aime, Microsoft, etc etc etc.

This transformation has progressed as of Wednesday, Feb 3rd. As Gamestop has brought on another 3 hires in order to turn the tide. So, as any smart investor should, let’s take a look into these people and see what they bring to the table.

\-- The following info is pulled from Linkedin

**Matt Francis**

GameStop has brought on Mr. Francis as Chief Technology Officer, a newly created role in the company. Starting Feb 15th. Leaving AMAZON in order to join.

Mr. Francis seems to be a strategic pick by Cohen, as he looks to be the **King of Transformations**.

In 2004, Mr. Francis worked with the US Postal Service developing new software that helped evaluate and manage large pallets from their customers. His tech is still being used today.

In 2005, Mr. Francis worked with Avenity, developing software that results in over 30% of the company’s revenue and developing the business to over 60 countries. Re-evaluating and redeploying staff where it was needed.

In 2010, Mr. Francis worked with Marchex, developing highly scalable advertising technology. He led major releases and empowered development to move at a faster and more sophisticated pace.

From 2010 to 2018, Mr. Francis worked with Zulily. Completely rebuilding and re-platforming their entire company onto a custom framework. Introducing new solutions, and building scalable data platforms. He bootstrapped early versions of most of Zulily’s e-commerce software that they still use today across merchandising, customer service, and data science. He also built a full team of developers to maintain said software. He expanded Zulily’s presence to Europe and Canada. Executive sponsor and leader of zulily's cloud transformation. He led the evaluation of cloud partners for capability, feature, and cost match, negotiated multi-year, multi-million dollar partnerships with primary and secondary cloud vendors, and organized and led the transition, schedule and execution plans for multiple teams. Helping Zulily reach $1 BILLION mark FASTER THAN ALL BUT 2 OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.

From 2018 to 2020, Mr. Francis worked with FlyHomes. He was responsible for all of FlyHomes technology, product expansion, machine learning, and data science functions. Mr. Francis led the re-branding team, creating a new logo, website redesign, and new branding guidelines.

From 2020, Mr. Francis worked with Amazon creating scalable databases to promote growth. He promoted a [not-so one size fits all data approach.](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/C4E27AQEPR0C6eiLfiA/articleshare-shrink_1280_800/0/1612302292350?e=1612566000&v=beta&t=L3ZOOgZimvWRZvWKuqREiAy2oeDnimW59RBg8-NBppE)

Now, Mr. Francis has joined GameStop’s team. I expect Mr. Francis to use his experience throughout these past companies to help GameStop in its transformation. As he has done in literally all of his previous work.

**Kelli Durkin**

Kelli Durkin was Chewy’s Director/VP of Customer Service for 8 years. This is another example of Cohen bringing on his best players from Chewy. Think about how much people dislike Gamestop’s customer service, their low return rates, and such. I expect this idea of GameStop to completely change. Imagine the shift of meme culture on GameStop. Memes going from GameStop to giving you 3$ in-store credit for 400$ consoles to Gamestop giving you a full-time house, and a paying job for trading in a $20 pokemon plushie.

**Josh Kreuger**

Similar to Mr. Francis, Kreuger has experience in big companies like Walmart and Amazon. **He also worked with Mr. Francis on the transformation of Zulily.** This was a coordinated hire by Cohen, Kreuger and Francis worked together on Zulily’s transformation, now they will work together on the transformation of GameStop into an Amazon-like e-commerce giant.

**The Conclusion**

So, while many of you freak out about the squeeze, which may or may not be over, who knows, who cares. The real reason most of us bought in, in early November-December, which is what spiraled us to this point is the VALUE play of GameStop. That is the reason DFV bought, that is the reason I bought, that is the reason many of us bought at less than $20 and are still holding. GameStop has what Amazon doesn’t, stores all across the country that can act as distribution centers. I fully expect Cohen to build GameStop into a giant that mirrors Tesla's stock situation.

Tesla was the most shorted stock on the market, just like GameStop, it then grew to unfathomed heights and split, and continued to grow.

It is my opinion that Cohen will grow GameStop to a true value of $500+ that will then split and continue to grow. If you can hold, **HOLD**. There is no point in selling at a loss on a stock that will be through the roof in who knows how long.

TLDR; The new hires are strategic plays to further progress GameStop’s transformation. Hold. Gamestop will be a $500+ company that will then split, and we are all at a very nice entry point._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I bought 5 GME @ 75 I regret Nothing! 🙌💎🚀 To the moon boys_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Don't buy GME.

This is not financial advice

1) The VW squeeze took over a month for the short squeeze to play out after the gamma squeeze (where we are).

2) The official short interest data that reports on Tuesday (Maybe? I've heard this may be delayed) will be reporting for January 29th. This information does not actually tell us much about the CURRENT state of shorts.

3) Stocks will go up and they will go down. Don't focus on the current "media" narrative on what's going on. Use your own judgement. If you still stand behind the basis of why you bought these shares to begin with (whatever shares you diamond hand bitches are holding) then just have some PATIENCE!

4) The lower the prices of these "meme" stocks go, the more powerful we are!! This actually gives us more buying power, so that as restrictions are lifted, as the squeeze commences, we can help drive the price up even HIGHER as we move forward. 

5) Don't get distracted. The HF guys (and majority of the media) want us to put our focus elsewhere. STAY STRONG! This is a great opportunity to average down even further, and increase potential gains down the line. 

6) DO NOT PLAY WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE! Sir, this is a fucking casino. Even with everything going on, stocks and the market (ESPECIALLY MEME STOCKS) Can be nothing more than a gamble. We are retards. We don't have insider information. If you're following the masses, and not investing LONG TERM into a company that you believe is undervalued or shows growth potential, you are gambling.

I'm just an idiot with a keyboard. Don't take me seriously. Stay strong and be patient everyone we got this shit!!!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🐳 🪓 Unusual Options Activity 102: Answering some questions/ deeper dive *Love and respect all the GME apes.  That said, no. This DD is not about that.  But, to appease you all, I will let you know that there was very bullish GME call flow activity today toward EOD. *✌️ 

Long. Skip to TLDR if illiterate. 

***

After the last whale DD **Question I got most is:**

*’Yo.  I’m trying to use [Unusual Activity notifier, usually Unusual Whales], and the plays I’m picking are shit.  What do?*

If you’re arbitrarily choosing it’s probably about 50/50

The good news is that there are a bunch of things you can do to raise that 50/50 rate significantly.  **Last DD was, honestly, mostly a call flow thing—this is specifically for enhancing your whale plays, largely using Unusual Whales callouts.**

 Let's start with a random Unusual Whales play and see if we like it based on some stuff I’ll review here:

[I just picked this DKNG play randomly by scrolling through today’s UW alerts.](https://i.imgur.com/DZasrJ6.jpg)

**Beating the 50/50** 🐳 🪓 

I'm going to break the things I look for into two simple categories: **1) Urgency Indicators** and **2) Anomolous Indicators**.  Some relatively fluid combination of these factors--with a little bit of gut feeling thrown in--determines what I choose to play.

**1) Anomolous Indicators: Price Difference, VOL/OI Ratio, IV**

❗️*Price Difference* ❗️

**You’re looking for orders with price strikes so unreasonable that it raises your eyebrow.** This is your #1 clue for something potentially worthwhile--why are they betting so far out the money? Does this bet diverge from the underlying's normal price movement?  **When my Unusual Whales alert goes off, I’m typically looking for at least 5% out the money,** depending on how close to expiration the call is.  That is not to say there aren’t a bunch of whale plays that are deep in the money or ATM and as valuable if not more— it’s just not my preference.

❗️*VOL/Open Interest Ratio*❗️

This one is very important. ** If Volume is higher than Open Interest it shows you 1: this is very very likely an opening call, not a closing call and 2: High volume/OI shows that the play is UnUsUaL, because the volume on the call option outweighs the amount of interest people have in the position.**  So,the VOL/OI ratio is a pretty good indicator, particularly when the ratio gets into the +1.0 range.  

A high ratio of volume on an order compared the average daily order volume is good, too.  You can check average daily vol on an option using Unusual Whales data on their site, or any number of other platforms. 

💡Volume/OI ratio high=good.  Volume/Daily volume ratio high= good.💡

❗️*Implied Volatility*❗️

So overlooked.  In the rush to be a part of the next boom, we are all guilty of picking up tickers with IV of like 400%.  To find the truly anomalous, **I always begin by looking for IV less than 100%**-- if IV is that low with a high % difference of strike to underlying, this is indicative of a major event coming that is unknown. For this reason I also always make sure it’s not just an earnings play. 

💡 Low IV stonks=nobody sees it coming, high IV stonks=everybody sees it coming💡

[So, what do we get from our DKNG example?  All systems go on those. Good stuff](https://i.imgur.com/EjKiKlH.jpg) 👌🏿 

**2) Urgency Indicators: Days Til Expiration, Volume, Whale order price in comparison to Bid/Ask Spread **

❗️*DTE*❗️

The 🚨 emoji symbol is my favorite sign on Unusual Whales, and is a good general representation of what I'm looking for.  **Although I’m not going to buy a weekly, I really like to see a call dated a few days-two weeks out as a starting point for inspection. ** The closer their order is to expiration, the more I L I K E T H E S T O C K.  This is the first factor I'm looking for while I filter.  If it's a month or more out, I'm probably skipping. Again, plenty of valuable plays further out, it’s just my preference. 

❗️*Volume*❗️

Decent volume implies this move is in a relatively stable ticker, or at least ordered by somebody with a decent amount of money if they buy a ton.  We're looking for big bets, not some WSB kid willing to yolo his $1,400 stimmy because "EV is the future, bro".  **We want large bets that indicate confidence and urgency.  Volume is how we get that. **

❗️*Bid/Ask Spread*❗️

This is important in a few ways.  The first is that you want the Bid/Ask spread relatively tight, say within a .10 difference.  If it's tight, it's pretty safe for you to play because you won't get burned when it's time to fill it. 

The second is that if you’re looking at an Unusual options order, the whale’s bid is much more legit if it’s closer to the ask on the bid/ask spread. It signifies aggression and confidence. 

[Is this DKNG pick a buy?  Let’s see](https://i.imgur.com/AWuajpG.jpg). 👌🏿 

Yes. I like the stock. 

***

**So, that’s that.  Hopefully it helped make some things more clear.  A couple other things to remember: **

1.	Buy your expiry a week further out if you’re chasing whales on weeklies

2.	YOU HAVE MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK: usually the play won’t happen til at least the end of the day.  A lot of time I used to rush in thinking I’d miss the news and get hammered for a few hours when I could’ve just waited til EOD.  Stay liquid

3.	Be patient. Luckily every day theres a merger, a new product, an ARKK addition, or whatever the fuck for like 100 different stonks.  Opportunities will come, don’t fall in love with a play you don’t need to make.  Once you start realizing the myriad of things that cause pops, you’ll see the opportunities for them all day long

4.	DO NOT FOLLOW EARNINGS WHALES I LOST $1k ON FEYE THIS WEEK 😭 

**TLDR: You can increase the success of your Unusual Call Activity plays by looking for larger OTM, closer dated plays that have high VOL/Open Interest Ratio and low IV.  If you can, check the bid/ask spread to make sure the whale is opening an aggressive call position, not closing.**

My father has about 1.2 million in a hedge fund that has been returning him an average of 15% for 7 years. He says one year they’ll be up 70% the next down 20% the following up 10%. And he says that all his friends plan to withdraw and invest in the overall market that is just. Simply. Safer.

There may be hedge funds that use this as an opportunity to absolutely CRAP on their competition. WHY would I invest in Melvin capital when black rock is the one that put a few others out of business (for example).... GET IT????? 

But I think if the short float is anything above 50% come the 4th. THIS IS GOING TO THE FUCKING NEXT GALAXY... 

IT IS IN THEIR best interest to filter us (the retail investors) OUT of this. To make the war of short squeezing much easier to be controlled by them and their partners.

Short volume is increasing? Hedges doubling down? So I was looking for some information about GME. I found a site, [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme), It shows the Short Volume Ratio increasing. From 32% on the 28th to 45% at close yesterday.   


Do I understand the concept of Short Volume Ratio correctly? As the ratio goes up> # of shares on the market goes up>$ of share goes down.   
Let me know where I am wrong here. The process of a Hedge Fund short selling more during all of this allows them to reset the call date on their stocks, unless the price goes up in which the shares they borrowed they have to return (original owner wants to sell them?).  Their thinking = Flood market with stock> drive price down> get current share holders turn diamond hands into angelsoft 400> they win by playing long game.

(EVs)

The short:
Maybe buy some Ford now and hang your hat on it? Maybe quick, sharp gains?

The medium:
Ford- announced lines of full EV sedans, suvs, and trucks
GM- announced lines of full EV sedans, suvs, and trucks
(It’s worth noting that the market has already taken notice and stock has risen to the occasion)
Will Farrell- GM paid him to do a super bowl commercial about it. Everyone will watch or discuss a super bowl commercial. 
Joe Biden- announced that by the end of his presidency, many (all? I can’t remember) of Govt issued vehicles will be EV. 

This is big because the USGov is obliged to buy American. Basically, Biden just wrote a check to American auto makers with that statement.  Once charging stations are widely available for all Fed vehicles (I say this because I’ve lived in the rural south where it’s not available at all), the population will have less hesitation when deciding to buy full EV or not. 

Companies that produce batteries like WKHS would be a decent and stable bet, but I dont know how much more growth they’ll have in the short term.

I am not a financial advisor, I am not your financial advisor, I am merely an idiot behind a keyboard with zero stake in the game who has watched the GME situation over the past couple of weeks.

# Hard truths

Anyone who bought in at $300 is an idiot. Sorry if that caused any offence, but it is true. The risk/reward at that buy in is too much in the risk category. If the stock hits $1000, then after taxes you will only increase $350 per share; a mere doubling of value. However it had/has a long way to go to reach that, and it more likely (especially with action taken by the short sellers) to drop from there losing your stake. You are quite literally going "double or nothing."

* $1,000 the hope
* $10,000 the dream
* $69,420.69 the meme

Note that those who bought in at sub $50 and were just buying the dips to increase their volume and lock the short sellers out of being able to settle the account are not complete idiots. Provided your average value is still sub $100 then you are still in a good risk/reward area

# Optimistic view

The millions of units which continue to be traded out of hours is a sign to me that the short sellers are driving the share price down by buying/selling low amongst themselves. Driving the price down has two major benefits for them:

* Share value drop will scare off new investors, and open up more opportunity for buying back the oversold stock
* The daily interest payments on $50 are significantly lower than those at $500, which means that they are able to hold on to their shorts for a much longer period of time

# Pessimistic view

The short sellers have closed out their position, and the short squeeze has already happened. Likelihood of this happening is low, considering the volume of trade after hours driving the price down, but we will not know until Tuesday.

# Short term prediction

On Monday the price will continue to drop down to around $30-40 per unit. Tuesday when the short interest is revealed the price will react accordingly. If there is high short interest it will jump again, if it has indeed closed out then the price will continue to fall.

Buying it a small stake at $30-40 on Monday would be a gamble, but it has a much better risk/reward (lose 50% or potentially increase 1,600%)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🦍🦍🦍WHO'S STILL HOLDING? 💎 👐🚀 Loaded up at $65 this morning lets go!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME investors take note _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Heres why DBX is an insane value play right now:  

to start with their balance sheet:

* $1.1 Billion is cash and investments.
* ZERO long term debt (this is uncommon in the tech growth space, especially the cloud sector) .
* With all this cash on the BS you are technically only paying \~ $7 Billion for a $9 Billion public market value.
* 25 forward PE which is crazy low when you look at the growth potential and compare to competitors premium in the space (most trade in the 100 - 1,000).

Market cap of $9 Billion

DPX is cheaper than when it went IPO

It is undervalued compared to cloud computing competitors.

Hellosign acquisition undervalued compared to competitor of $DOCU which is worth $45 Billion On its own.

$DBX should be trading 4x higher than it is currently based on the premium other investors are paying for competitors in the space

* Large short float (7.4%) meaning squeeze potential as upper long term resistance is tested on volume, Stops will get triggered.
* Relatively low float and market cap meaning it wouldn't take a lot of volume for this stock to trade 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% higher on a day with big news. Low supply of shares with high demand will cause price to go up.
* Not many cash flow positive business have float structures this luctrave.
* They are unlikely to sell new shares to the public if it does gap up as they already have lots of cash on the balance sheet and a cash flow positive business model. **Low risk of share dilution.**
* Closest competitor to Hellosign market cap of $45 Billion
* This is 4x the size of $DBX which is at $9 Billion. Hellosign could grow to the size of $DOCU.
* $DBX has a big potential $DOCU competitor with already great business and growing e-workspace business.
* You are paying a cheaper premium for $DBX and it has more growth potential and is already profitable.
* The selling pressure from $DBX has stopped and insiders and institutions are setting up long positions to play value tech.
* $DBX has begun to break trend and outperform major markets.
* Options activity on the 1 year chain shows a substantial long bias with traders accumulating calls.
* $DBX will gain sympathy from a strong IPO market, cloud computing market, and tech market.
* Investors who missed $DOCU 560% YTD run will look to add $DBX due to the HelloSign acquisition.
* Relative rotation shows capital is flowing out of large cap technology into value tech.
* Institutions have increased their positions by 50,000,000 shares.
* **Institutions own 84% of $DBX**
* A total of 463 institutions hold $DBX and 217 of them have recently added to their holdings.
* There are 60 new holders who recently accumulated a total of 11,675,563 shares during the long term channel on the daily chart.
* There has only been 7,766,483 shares sold by institutions during this trading channel.
* This signals institutions are net long $DBX on a break of this channel and will look to add momentum lots to their position

Positions or ban.💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's so strange to me that people will FOMO in at $350 but won't mitigate their risk and resist buying a falling knife at $50-60. Like think about it, what's more likely, it goes to $10 and you lose most your money, or a dying meme stock goes to $400?

Even Warren Buffett himself once said "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." But Warren Buffet actually knows what he is fucking doing, retards.

Think about how when you and the other autist apes were FOMOing in at $300+ and how much fucking money you have lost. Wish you got in lower? Now may be your chance...to move on. (Or not, lol). You can always lose more money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Down Do I just sell amc at this point, 500 @ 17_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WE ARE STILL HOLDING _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seriously? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This Guy be Wildin' _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My parents told me not to waste all of my money...

Regroup and enjoy the 🏈 this weekend, or whatever it is you do. ✌️_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The technical term for one of the tactics used lately is, “bear raid”. In the same vein as making your voice heard by voting, make your voice heard by contacting your local representative to encourage them to push for investigating this matter.

One of the tactics used lately is what’s called a “bear raid”. Definitions from Wikipedia and Investopedia, respectively:

From Wikipedia:

> A bear raid is a type of stock market strategy, where a trader (or group of traders) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position. The name is derived from the common use of bear or bearish in the language of market sentiment to reflect the idea that investors expect downward price movement.[1]
>
> A bear raid can be done by spreading negative rumors about the target firm,[2] which puts downward pressure on the share price. This is typically considered a form of securities fraud. Alternatively, traders could take on large short positions themselves, manipulating the price with the large volume of selling,[3] making the strategy self-perpetuating.

And from Investopedia:

> A bear raid is an illegal practice of ganging up to push a stock's price lower through concerted short selling and spreading adverse rumors about the targeted company. A bear raid is sometimes resorted to by unscrupulous short sellers who want to make a quick buck from their short positions.
>
> A bear-raid target is generally a company that is going through a challenging period, since its vulnerable position makes it easy fodder for short sellers. While short selling is legal, coordinated short selling is viewed as market manipulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and spreading false rumors is tantamount to fraudulent activity.

I think it’s important that we use precise terminology when calling for action. The blatant smear campaign in the media (especially CNBC) to sow doubt and sway public opinion, as well as the manufactured story of “squeezing” silver for the purposes of misdirection cannot go unnoticed. We must call out this bad behavior. Let’s do this!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Hedgies are gonna go after his employer too! God Speed DFV! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If I see “to the moon 🚀💎🙌” one more time, I’m going to strangle somebody with my 🦍🙌. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hedgies are still losing big if this is the new floor, right!? Total noob here but fully committed. I’m wondering if holding at this price around $60 is still the same effect as the $100/200+? I’m holding either way, will just feel better knowing it’s still effective to be doing so._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Proud Retard I was so so so close to putting in a stop order and counting my losses at $50! 

But I am so glad I cancelled it before market open. We fought back against the 1% today. We kept GME alive. 

Keep holding Apes.

Diamond hands will make it to the moon! Let's squeeze these hedgie fuckers. 

This is not financial advice, retard._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Honest question, is AMC a deviation from GME or a SECOND rocket? I'm not saying the sudden AMC posting isn't wrong, hell I encourage it though I have 2 GME that I bought at $200. What's making super confused is why people think they're the NEXT $GME when they've BOTH been following the EXACT SAME trends, the graphs look practically identical.  
What's the motivation other than the FOMO?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on the future of GameStop? Any possible future investments? Tips for investing? I am down in the dumps about GME. Honestly, it was my choice to do what I did. I still have hope and I am still holding.

Besides that, I’m planning on investing in PLUG when I have enough to invest again. I am also still kind of new to investing and I would love to learn more.

Anyone have any tips about investing? Long term or short term? I don’t want to randomly toss money wherever anymore. I became too cocky to quickly. I’d love to hear any suggestions for investing!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC TO THE MOON Fellow retards, let’s get amc back UP_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Someone converted a commercial to r/WSB vs Wallstreet movie _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Everyone must feel great owning stock in a company like GME that is on the verge of bankruptcy closing stores due to lack of sales _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IDEX warning Noticed some people here trying to convince others that IDEX can be a good buy for the long term, but failed to give us any news on it.

-Does the red circle signify when gamma squeeze was supposed to start and then dip after that is when they restricted buying and killed the initial “meme” momentum?

- And what if the two spikes in the green circle are hedge funds dumping the first half of the short positions in two quick but slightly separate dumps, and then other hedgies that knew the play exiting on those highs after buying in on the low points while retail buyers were blocked which started the price drop?

If there were only 1.7m short positions exited this week:

https://imgur.com/gallery/kLzbXSc - 2/5: 25.4m shorted

https://imgur.com/gallery/MsXQVz9 - 2/1: 27.1m shorted, down 35m from the start of them exiting their short positions.

(And this is S3 data who people aren’t really trusting as the official short report for 1/31 isn’t even out yet)

Then is there a chance they only exited just a part of their positions and another squeeze could happen?

I dunno this is all me just daydreaming and thinking aloud to myself, I’m not a financial advisor and I’m not suggesting anyone trade with my advice. I also don’t really think any of the short numbers out right now are accurate, or how much of the short positions reported are new positions set at 500, but I just needed to word vomit 😂

EDIT: Guys I can’t see any comments besides the automod comment, can people PM me answers instead?

EDIT 2: So nobody can explain the short interest number in those articles/tweets?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We never should’ve been using Robinhood in the first place Now that I’m a week into trading and I’m thoroughly convinced I’ll be the next Warren Buffet, I’ve developed a strategy for swing trading that I’m pretty confident will produce a good amount of income. My strategy relies on triggering stop loss and limit orders, but low and behold I find Robinhood is severely lacking in this department. You can’t place OCO orders(once cancels the other; two simultaneous orders on one stock to both limit loss and set your exit point). 

ThinkorSwim by Ameritrade on the other hand not only allows these types of orders, but I’m reading that they even allow bracket orders, which basically will automate my strategy removing the need for calculating percentages with every damn stock I buy. 

TLDR: Robinhood sucks ass in a multitude of ways and we should all be using different brokerage services_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 💎🖐️ Personally down about 2500$....

If done at close today, a call for 2/12 at a strike of $27.5 could have been sold. I would place a limit buy at $27.5 to protect myself from downside should the underlying increase and I get exercised. I would have netted $14 in premium and would need $2750 to cover myself. It looks like over the past year this would have worked for roughly 48 weeks, annualized the return would be about 24%. If it gaps up AH when it is near the strike I could lose a percent or two but it should be negligible. If it reaches my limit buy and dropped back down before I could close my position and sell I also face minimal risk. Do you see any flaws that I am missing? 

Of course since 24% isnt going to be enough to purchase a yacht with a helicopter big enough to transport my lambo I will require leverage but I havent nailed down any flaws in my merchant cash advance ponzi scheme yet so dont downvote for my sub 1000% returns, they will come_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Still holding.
