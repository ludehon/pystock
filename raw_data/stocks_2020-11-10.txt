For context I’m using this article as a reference for my claims. Personally I’m very bullish on RKT, I’m a fan of high cash flow businesses. They do have an uphill battle to be seen as a tech company but that’s the risk reward currently. Their financials are showing great growth and I am pretty content on adding to my position under 20. Also 1$B in share buy backs public float value is around 2.3B. That’s a massive increase for shareholder equity coming._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Travel stocks not so bad after all? My entire portfolio is made up out of travel, leisure and oil. Over the past months people have ridiculed me for this portfolio but over the past two days, after many red days, my portfolio is now approx. 25% in the green. 

My holdings are: WYNN, JWN, RTX, RDSA, Groupe ADP and AMADY.

Also people say I should sell after this rally driven by vaccine euphoria but we are not nearly at the old highs of these stocks so I will just keep holding on for dear life until it atleast gives me a 100% return and we get to the other side of this coronavirus mess. In the meantime I will collect juicy dividends._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is your NIO and SE Earnings play for Tuesday? NIO and SE are both great long term plays but they also may bleed out on Tuesday if they don't have excellent ER.

For NIO, I'm betting on a sell off before the ER. NIO's sales should be pretty great and they've already delivered over 100% more vehicles than the previous year, but this could end up being a "buy the rumor, sell the news" event for many looking to make a quick buck. 

SE I have less confidence in. I honestly don't know what to expect from them. Do you think their EPS will be better this year? Their COVID growth may be wearing off.

What are your expectations? Anyone making any interesting plays on these?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think solar stocks are a good indicator of just how irrational this sell off has been. I get that people are pulling out of overvalued tech and pumping money into still-beaten down companies that stand to gain from a vaccine. But TAN is down over 5% from close on Friday. Sure, some solar stocks may have been overvalued (looking at you, SEDG) but I don’t think that an ETF tracking that industry was really all that overvalued, especially with an all but confirmed Biden presidency.

I’m doubtful that semiconductors are going to rebound to where they were a week ago any time soon because there was such a consolidation of profitable industries, but there has to be at least some upwards correction coming in the near term to tech because this appears to be much more than a correction of overvalued stocks right now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best rapid trading platforms? I currently have a Schwab account and although it’s pretty easy to trade with, I dislike that the settlement dates are always multiple days after I close a position. This means I’m prevented from using these “unsettled funds” until the settlement date for every single trade. Does anyone know better platforms for rapid trading?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tax on Stock Losses Hi,

I apologize since this is probably a stupid question. I recently invested $250 on stocks. I ended up selling them all for $150, losing $100 (stupid, I know). Do I still have to file for taxes? I don't have a job, so if I do, it would just be for the stocks. I live in California, USA if that helps.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you have fear about putting money into a position (even money you can afford to lose), how do you overcome that? i have about half my porttfolio in cash. I think things like square, msft, icln, etc will all go up but i am afraid to put any real money into them. I buy a little here and there when instead i could buy more. for example, i bought 1 share of square months ago when I could have afforded to buy like 20 but i was scared. 

Or i bough like 20 shares of nio at 16$ when i could have bought like 300 but i was scared.

how do you guys overcome this? meanwhile, i went big on Rockett and i am down 1k._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Have you ever lost an entire position, or lost substantially a position? How do you overcome the disappointment? Wondering if you guys have ever lost an entire stock position, or lost a substantial position (like 90%+ loss)? I mean realizing the loss, not just a paper loss. If so, what was the story behind the investment and how did you overcome the disappointment?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ interesting day in the market today, so what if anything did you purchase? wondering if i am illogical for buy anything today. So today i bought 2 shares of square, 1 share of baba, 1 share of beyond, and 20 shares of ICLN. 

I am not even sure what the point of buying 1 share of something is...not going to make or break anything since those are all I now own in baba and beyond. I have been inerested in them for a while but only bought 1 share because of the potentially bad news on both of them. Although i noticed beyond moved up slow and steady throughout the day.

I now own 5 shares of square and 40 shares of ICLN. 

i can afford right now to put in a lot more money right now but i am scared. Part of me just wants to throw everything i have right now into baba, beyond, nio, ICLN, msft, amazon and pray they all jump

Wondering what you guys bought today?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IAG (International Airline Group) good for the long term? Looking at where they were pre-covid this seems like a no brainer. Whilst hospitality and some airlines jumped on Monday gone, IAG rose, but not as much to make it seem a worthwhile long term investment. Given their share price was 6 times more than it was now, come summer 2021, I feel there could be some real potentianl once the world gets back to normal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ REITs and energy stocks are booming REITs are great for dividends but they still have not fully recovered so there is a lot of room left to go up.  Once another stimulus comes out, I really think they will shoot up again.

Energy stocks also have quite a bit of room to go up.  Oil will not be going anywhere anytime soon since oil is used in an insane amount of products.   EV share is slowly growing but that will take quite some time before before EV overtakes gasoline cars. And then you have third world countries that are growing and industrializing and have a need for oil.   Energy companies also deal with natural gas and some dabble in renewables to some extent.  My take is that oil has another run left in it.  Obama and Biden were the kings of oil \\ natural gas since under them, they grew a whole lot.

CVX_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top Market News - Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2020 **Rotation from growth to value continues:**

* Value outperformed growth by another \~240 bps on Tuesday after Monday's 450 bp gap, which reversed four months of growth outperformance in one session. Came after favorable coronavirus vaccine news, which helped the rotation continue today. A vaccine breakthrough has long been flagged as the most powerful tailwind for a sustained rotation following the longstanding upside leadership of growth and momentum factors. There has also been some focus on positive economic and earnings surprise momentum as drivers, while analysts have highlighted extreme positioning and valuation divergences as well. In addition, while a split Congress has taken the likelihood of meaningful fiscal stimulus off the table, additional support is still coming. While value and cyclicals do face headwinds from worsening coronavirus trends, growth has also seemed to run up against some very elevated expectations, a dynamic evidenced by the lackluster reaction to strong Q3 earnings.

**Growth sectors extend yesterday's historic underperformance:**

* Growth sectors underperformed again. **Tech,** **consumer discretionary and** **communication services** were the only sectors lower with the FAANGs mostly down. Software, semis, restaurants, travel and leisure also among weaker groups. **Healthcare** an outperformer on gains across pharma and distributors, while hospitals mostly extended yesterday's gains. **Financials** ahead with insurers the best group, offsetting weakness across banks, particularly moneycenters. **Materials** led by chemicals. **Industrials** saw broad gains, particularly A&D, rails, and electricals/multis. **Consumer staples** ahead with drug stores, tobacco, beverages among the best groups. **Energy** the best performer WTI higher as IOCs extended Monday's big gains.

**Busy day of Fedspeak:**

* **Dallas' Kaplan** (voter) told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/fed-s-kaplan-says-virus-resurgence-threatens-next-two-quarters?sref=J9GPLx1B) the next two quarters will be difficult, but he sees a strong 2021, expecting 3.5% growth. In [testimony](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/quarles20201110a.htm) to a Senate committee, **Vice Chair for Supervision Quarles** said bank strength remains intact with high liquidity and capital levels, **Boston's Rosengren** (non-voter) said in a [speech](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/Speeches/PDF/20201110-text.pdf) policymakers should watch for imbalances as they emerge, and that excessive risk-taking could prolong economic distress, based on previous cycles. **San Francisco's Daly** (non-voter) told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/fed-officials-in-robust-discussions-about-the-future-of-their-asset-purchase-program.html) that the Fed is in discussions over what more it can do around asset purchases and how the bank should plan communications around asset purchases moving forward. The Fed is currently purchasing \~$120B a month in bonds, though many believe it could increase the amount and/or change the composition of purchases, though [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-turns-attention-to-asset-purchases-after-spelling-out-low-rate-pledges-11604226601) noted broad skepticism that strategy would do much given already-low rates.

**McConnell repeats call for limited stimulus package:**

* Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) on Monday called for limited stimulus bill by year-end, in the wake of positive news on a coronavirus vaccine and falling unemployment ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/mcconnell-calls-for-smaller-stimulus-after-pfizer-vaccine-data?srnd=premium-asia&sref=J9GPLx1B)). Also said this afternoon he will be speaking with House Leader Pelosi, though looking for highly targeted deal ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/525364-mcconnell-pushing-for-highly-targeted-covid-relief-deal?__twitter_impression=true)). Other Republican senators warned getting a deal done in the lame duck session will be hard and signaled openness to wrapping a stimulus package into a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown on 11-Dec. Elsewhere, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stimulus-defense-bill-on-congresss-long-to-do-list-11605032240) noted President-elect Biden expected to play bigger role in stimulus discussion during lame duck to pave path for agreement before he takes office. While Senate Republicans have been focused on a bill worth \~$500B, House Democrats have insisted it must be in excess of $2T. Odds of a stimulus bill before 2021 further complicated by Trump's refusal to concede and run-off elections in Georgia in early January that could determine control of Senate next year.

**Vaccine breakthrough also brings key unanswered questions, logistical challenges:**

* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-vaccine-results-leave-questions-about-safety-longevity?srnd=premium&sref=L75TRUmI) noted that amid all the excitement surrounding news the coronavirus vaccine candidate from Pfizer (PFE-US ) and BioNTech (BNTX-US ) was more than 90% effective in late-stage trials, there are still a number of issues to be sorted out. It highlighted uncertainty over how long the vaccine will confer protection and how many will benefit. Also pointed out the headline number says little about what kind of cases are being prevented. Added that vaccines like Pfizer's must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-big-challenge-after-a-covid-vaccine-is-giving-it-to-enough-people-11604945455?mod=hp_lead_pos1) also discussed the myriad logistical challenges surrounding production and distribution. Pointed out that even at a much better than expected efficacy rate of 90%, at least three-quarters of the population would have to be inoculated to achieve herd immunity and life may not return to normal until 2022.

**Checking in on the bullish narrative:**

* As has been the case for the better part of the last seven or eight months, the biggest tailwind for stocks seems to be the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the coronavirus pandemic, with BofA pegging the combined stimulus at over $21T. Vaccine optimism has also played a meaningful role, with recent news of a near-term breakthrough driving a rotation to value and cyclical plays. At the same time, there are thoughts that growth factors are likely to be protected by favorable secular themes. Resilient corporate earnings, largely a function of operating leverage, have been another widely discussed bright spot. The removal of the election overhang has also helped and the likelihood of a split Congress and no meaningful shift in tax and regulatory policy has overshadowed earlier hopes for more significant coronavirus and infrastructure stimulus.

**Checking on the bearish narrative:**

* While stimulus has been the big driver of the bullish narrative for stocks, there continue to be concerns about depleted monetary policy arsenals and worries central banks are increasingly is pushing on a string. In addition, there is no appetite for meaningful fiscal stimulus in a Republican controlled Senate. Worsening coronavirus trends have been largely overshadowed by vaccine optimism but represent a headwind on growth, even without a return to the draconian lockdown measures seen early on in the pandemic. A rotation out of growth has some broader market implications given the extent to which the S&P 500 is concentrated in big tech. There are also potential risks from the bond market given the massive inflows driven by a reach for yield. While earnings beat rates have been strong, they have benefited from bombed-out expectations and the bar is moving higher.

**Supreme Court signals it is unlikely to strike down Obamacare**

* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/supreme-court-obamacare-kavanaugh-435711), the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html) and other outlets discussed how the Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled that Obamacare would likely survive its third major legal challenge. Noted that at least five justices, including two members of the court's conservative majority, suggested the individual mandate was severable from the rest of the law. Other conservative justices also expressed doubt about whether Congress' decision to scrap the penalty for failing to secure health insurance because it could be no longer be justified as a tax, caused any harm to the plaintiffs. While the case has been widely viewed as weak, there still have been concerns about the fate of Obamacare under the court's enhanced conservative majority. This development has driven the outperformance of managed care (particularly managed Medicare) and hospital stocks.

**Amazon under regulatory scrutiny in Europe:**

* European Commission filed charges against Amazon (AMZN-US ) on Tuesday after it concluded it breached antitrust rules by using third-party sellers' data for its own benefit. EU launched probe into Amazon in June 2019 and WSJ reported in June of this year it was planning formal antitrust challenges. Brussels said today it is also launching a second investigation into Amazon's e-commerce processes. While big tech has come under heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the US and Europe, it has not been much on overhang on equity sentiment as the group has been a big beneficiary of its leverage to secular growth and disruption themes, several aspects of which have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger threat to the group from near-term perspective seems to be a vaccine-driven rotation from these very crowded longs to under-owned value and cyclical plays.

**NextEra rebuffed by Evergy, Lowe's not in talks to acquire HD Supply, Justice Department clears Uber purchase of Postmates:**

* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/evergy-ma-nextera-energy/exclusive-nextera-energy-in-15-billion-bid-for-evergy-sources-idUKL1N2HV2J0) reported that **NextEra** (NEE-US ), the world's largest producer of solar and wind energy, made a \~$15B all-stock offer to acquire US power utility **Evergy** (EVRG-US ). However, Evergy rejected the offer and it is unclear whether NextEra, which was also recently rebuffed buy Duke Energy (DUK-US ), will make a new approach. **Lowe's** (LOW-US ) said in a [statement](https://www.streetaccount.com/EmailSearchHandler.axd?guid=9a8c0f36-641d-4398-b382-a4e7dacf3827&press_release=true&ticker=HDS&iid=2911999) that it is not in discussions with **HD Supply** (HDS-US ) about a transaction. Followed earlier [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/lowe-s-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-hd-supply?sref=L75TRUmI) report that said the companies were discussing a deal. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/doj-clears-uber-postmates-deal-566fed38-2d2a-4a1d-95af-45fd61df57bc.html) cited a source familiar with the deal who said the Justice Department has cleared **Uber**'s (UBER-US ) $2.65B all-stock deal to acquire food delivery company **Postmates**. **Adobe** (ADBE-US ) confirmed agreement to acquire privately held **Workfront**, a work management platform for marketers, for $1.5B.

**Post-election transition slowed by legal challenges:**

* [Axios](https://www.axios.com/bill-barr-voter-fraud-investigations-7bfc378a-35f8-467f-9e74-10aa57c8c7d5.html) noted that President Trump has refused to concede the election to President-elect Biden, reiterating allegations of widespread voter fraud and corruption despite a lack of specific evidence. Added that his claims have been shot down by Democratic and Republican secretaries of state. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/trump-campaign-s-legal-blitz-isn-t-targeting-enough-votes-to-win?sref=L75TRUmI) also discussed how Trump's legal challenges are unlikely to gain any meaningful traction. However, [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20201110&instance_id=23967&nl=dealbook&regi_id=33659448&segment_id=44093&te=1&user_id=2b41d3782bf056154514beb0de555f4d) pointed out that leading Republicans have coalesced around Trump's strategy. In addition, the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-4eeb9e0c97301a23ae8d05b54c3144fd) reported Attorney General Barr has authorized US attorneys to investigate alleged voter fraud. [Reuters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/biden-transition-team-calls-on-federal-agency-to-declare-winner?sref=L75TRUmI) said the Biden transition team is considering legal action to force the General Services Administration to designate him the winner so that it can begin accessing federal resources needed to ensure an orderly transfer of power.

**Political fight brewing over whether to extend Fed's emergency facilities:**

* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/economy/federal-reserve-emergency-loans.html) discussed how a political fight is brewing over whether to extend the Fed's emergency loan programs, which expire on 31-Dec. Paper said that while the Fed might be inclined to keep the programs in effect, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has signaled he would prefer to end the one that purchases municipal bonds, and has come under heightened pressure from Republicans to allow all five of the Treasury-funded programs to lapse. However, some Democrats had been looking to the municipal program as a backup option if Congress fails to pass additional funds for state and local governments. Paper highlighted some debate about the potential market impact of ending the programs. While they have seen little use, they have been a big part of the powerful Fed signaling effect that quickly helped repair credit markets earlier this year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is $PLTR becoming some new hype?

Apple's next-generation Macs will use a new chip called the M1, a big brother to the A-series chips in its iPhone 12, that Apple says will bring new power and battery life to its personal computers.

The company's goal with the chip was to achieve "industry leading performance and features while relentlessly focusing on performance efficiency," Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, said at an [Apple launch event Tuesday](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-silicon-mac-event-one-more-thing-announcement-how-to-watch-livestream-today/).

In the MacBook Air, the M1 helps provide battery life that's good for "up to" 15 hours of web browsing and 18 hours of video. Processor speed is 3.5 times faster than that of the previous Intel-based model, while graphics are 5 times faster, Apple said. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is up to 3 times faster than the best-selling Intel machine, Apple said. The company didn't detail the testing behind its performance claims.

The processor has 16 billion transistors, a substantial increase from the 11.8 billion used in the iPhone 12's A14 Bionic. That lets Apple increase the number of central processing cores from six to eight. The M1 has four high-performance cores for heavy-duty work and four high-efficiency cores for low-priority tasks.

Like the iPhone and iPad chips, the M1 also has dedicated circuitry for graphics and and [artificial intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) processing.

Intel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Performance is crucial to the Mac chip transition, influencing whether Mac buyers embrace the new models enthusiastically, sit things out for a while, or even buy a Windows machine powered by [Intel's new Tiger Lake chips](https://www.cnet.com/news/intel-tiger-lake-chip-delivers-long-awaited-laptop-speed-boost/). With [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/covid-white-house-hot-spot-vaccine-progress-flu-season-fears-coronavirus-pandemic-update/) triggering a PC sales surge, it's prime time for Apple to try to lure as many customers as possible.

Good performance also means that Apple's Rosetta technology, for running Intel Mac software on Apple silicon machines, is more useful during the chip transition.

Hey folks, 

I'd be very interested in having a discussion regarding if the allocation makes sense or, considering objectives, it could be somewhat simplified. It is as follows: VTI 43.56%, VGT 10.45%, ICLN 9.69%, IHI, 7.61%, VCR 7.12%, ARKW 5.13%, ARKG 3.64%, ARKQ 3.57%, MSFT 3.41%, BABA 2.99%, ITEQ 2.88%. Weighed expense ratio is about 0.25%.

I've been invested for almost 2 years, doing some bad shit in the middle, and sort of settling in my current allocation now. My idea is to invest aggressively (I'm 27) contributing quarterly and rebalancing annually if needed. Towards a later stage I'd switch to a less riskier profile by adding up bonds or the likes, moving toward a 3 or 4 fund portfolio. I believe most of these sectors will continue to grow significantly while some are still quite young and seeding, thus quite of potential ahead. 

I'd be very interested in asking you folks if you feel there's a way the same exposure to these sectors could be maintained with a simplified allocation? I'm finding a hard time convincing myself to get rid of a couple of the more riskier ETFs, since I'd like to keep invested in all of them because of the relevance I believe these industries (in their own path) will achieve in the future. However perhaps I'm missing something and I could still achieve a similar exposure with less products, more concentration  while still aiming for a similar performance.

Since then, I've become a huge fan and now order everything for my dog from them. I probably won't go back to a pet store again. I'd like to invest in the company for the long term but I'm unsure of how to evaluate a good buy point and understand the company's growth potential.

**Chewy vs. Amazon - (imo)**

* Chewy was a much better shopping experience for me when it came to pet products.  
* Searching for a product on Chewy doesn't yield 8000 options like it does on Amazon. I've found Chewy's consolidated product offerings to be much better in quality than Amazon and competitive in price. It's a much less overwhelming shopping experience.
* I've also found Amazon's reviews to be completely unreliable in the past and it has definitely impacted my perception of the product quality. On multiple occasions, I've been offered a full refund by sellers on Amazon if I change my review to a 5-star review.

**How to Evaluate?**

Back in September, I [read this article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/20/is-chewy-stock-a-buy/) which specifically mentioned Chewy being overvalued at the stock price of $53/share. I waited and decided not to buy. Chewy continued to rise to \~75$/share before coming back down to \~$58 these last few days. All of the discussion on this sub about Chewy from the last few months also talked about how overvalued the company was at various share prices between $40-$70/share.

Are there technical indicators, like moving averages or something, that help with evaluating when to buy in for the long term? How big of a correction do people predict? Is that something that generally happens after an earnings call?

Bare with me since I'm quite inexperienced in trading. But as reported the vaccine only had a 90% (1 to 10) success rate. According to my medicine professor (so it's not entirely baseless) a vaccine needs for a virus like COVID needs more like a 99.9% (effectiveness of 1 to 1000) success rate to be seen as effective.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Esports Stocks or Infrastructure like AMD etc? I'm new to investing and the stockmarket so please forgive me if I haven't posted enough info about what I want to do. And apologies in advance if I'm flagrantly misusing the wrong terminology too!

That being said, I have a lot of knowledge of video games so I wanted to first invest in esports and video game streaming.

I am currently interested in Tencent, Huya and Activision Blizzard.

Tencent because they have League of Legends and the tournaments associated... as well a large holding in Huya and Douya who are set to merge creating a massive video game streaming service in China akin to Twitch. Tencent are also a very large multi-media company owning many other communications and technology businesses etc

Huya since they are a large streaming platform and is quite a cheap stock (for me).

Activision-Blizzard since they have some good video game IP's and a good hold of esports tournaments and video games which I think will grow. They own the esports competitions in which their games take place.

In general, I'm not sure about EA and tournaments for sports games, I just don't think it will grow like games akin to CS:GO, LoL, SC2. Activision Blizzard does have some failing games I think right now. Activions-Blizzards own Overwatch and Hearthstone games are dying and I don't see anything big coming out. CoD Warzone has proved popular but I dont think the new CoD's will generate near enough excitement as they used to.

Perhaps I should invest in some hyper casual games and mobile apps too (Sciplay, King etc) but I am curious as to what others think!

To diversify and invest in some infrastructure im thinking to invest in AMD or Nvidia and perhaps MSI as well.

Again this is my first dip into the lake, and I wanted to start with video game related stocks. I will definitely invest in others to diversify my portfolio. What do other people think with video games right now, and is it a good place for me to start? I find the whole sector really interesting and it's something close to my heart as a passionate long time video gamer :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a way to invest with very little to almost no risks? So I was thinking about it and realised that if you added a stop loss of around .5-1% of the money invested then you would stop any sort of loss before it eats into your money. By doing this you won’t lose much money but only have money to gain.

Would this be a viable option for someone who doesn’t want to risk losing too much money?

This brings me to my next point, would this be worth doing for NIO_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nikola discloses grand jury subpoenas from DOJ Saw this come across CNBC this morning.

Compare [the heat map from last week's early voter results rally (showing Biden in the lead)](https://imgur.com/73jvrvF) with yesterday's heat map. It should be clear that [the same selling of COVID bubble stocks and the same buying of real economy stocks is taking place in yesterday's heat map.](https://imgur.com/d9ke1pn). This same rally pattern that comes at the expense of COVID bubble stocks and injects investment capital into the real economy stocks has been happening with all Biden bumps and rallies.

> Sidebar: [Here's the heatmap for this morning, 11/10/2020](https://imgur.com/SYSAdXI), and it shows there's a pause in the rally while a small collection of stocks continue to get cash while some other stocks continue to sell off. So the rotation is slowing/pausing this morning.

This Monday, it's become obvious that a rotation from the coronavirus bubble stocks and into the real economy stocks is fully underway. It's also obvious that [a significant amount of money for the stock buying is being taken out of COVID bubble stocks](https://imgur.com/d9ke1pn), deflating the bubble as investors take money out to fund purchases of other stocks. This is reflecting in the NASDAQ sinking while the Dow rises.

**Misinformation in financial news headlines about the rallies of the past 2 weeks**

However, last week and this week, we have a lot of writers in the media and broad conservative bias across financial news reporting that is explaining away each Biden rally as something else. First we heard, "[Rally on relief that there wasn't a Blue Wave and that there would be a Divided Government](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-rally-presidential-election-endorsement-divided-government-evercore-schlosstein-2020-11-1029767176)" which people seemed to believe, although it was obvious that divided government relief doesn't make sense when there was an unmet need for stimulus from the GOP senate. Now we're hearing "[Pfizer vaccine rally!](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/09/business/us-economy-coronavirus)" even though the rally started Sunday night in a massive overseas rally and US stock futures were raging up before Pfizer's announcement. Note that just as in politics, where there is the low-information voter, there is a low-information investor, who is constantly fooled by headlines from financial news outlets. Don't believe these narratives and spins, they're distracting from what's really happening: a Biden rally that is just starting and will continue.

**Don't believe conclusions that you read in financial news headlines**

Articles published in financial news about what is causing a rally or pullback are almost always made up, and daily investors know this and read past the conclusion for whatever information bits are in the articles. The conclusions about causes of rallies or pullbacks are there to distract low-information investors (let's call them retail investors and low-level pros) from keeping up with industry insiders who make money off having first mover advantage and make money off slower movers. Misinformation in financial news headlines is one way that institutional investors gain advantage over retail investors and rip them off. 

**Rally is a rotation into real economy stocks unleashed by Biden's win**

This is a Biden rally, one of a few so far and there are more to come. We're seeing a massive shift into real economy stocks as listed above, because we have a stable president with rational economic and fiscal behaviors who is more likely to get constructive bipartisan engagement with the House and Senate than most other politicians, and he obviously plans to put that into managing the pandemic and problems at hand to get us back on our feet. As I have been trying to inform people in the past couple of weeks, a lot of the money going into these real economy stocks will come from COVID bubble stocks. 

**When will the bleeding in (at least some) coronavirus bubble stocks stop?**

The real question, for those who plan to hold onto COVID bubble stocks and not sell their positions, is when will the bleeding in COVID bubble stocks stop? We have seen mini-waves of rotations so far, like the one that prompted my thread last week, that I linked above. This wave of rotations that we're in right now is going to be big because of fear of missing out. But some bubble stocks will do better than others.

The stocks that will do better than some others are those that have a strong after-Coronavirus pandemic value. Those are the best ones to hold onto, including tech stocks that have a strong workplace penetration, multiple product lines and strong growth stories. There are some bargains due to the selloff, which include Chinese stocks (their valuations were supported by real growth as China exceeds past levels of GDP for significant growth), EV and renewable energy stocks that are hitting intraday lows before recovering or taking small losses (these are the long term growers for the next few years at least), and some real estate, home and residential building stocks as there are permanent shifts away from expensive to maintain office workplaces into home working. 

As far as how long this selloff will go on, I don't know, but I do know that not many professional investors feel emotionally attached enough to hold onto stocks for 4 years to get back in the green again because they bought at panic-level highs. Most would at least study the situation and take losses by trimming positions that are less likely to significantly rebound after the current selloff eases up.

**Consider rebalancing your portfolios for real world ("meat world") traditional stocks**

Although many in this subreddit refuse to consider real economy stocks, like transportation, infrastructure, old energy and industrials, including old tech science/engineering/research firms, I would strongly urge people to consider rebalancing their own portfolios because investing in America's real economy and infrastructure is needed if the next generation is going to live in a country that is not a crumbling, second-world nation. Investments in the future shouldn't only consist of gaming, media, cool cars and gadget companies. Industrials, infrastructure, energy and old tech stocks lift high quality employment for the nation's middle class. If ESG investing included social and environmental ideals, there should be some room for a ESI (engineering, science and industrial) investing that means investing for a strong structure and substance for a good meat world economy of the future. 

I would strongly encourage retail investors here to think about rebalancing their portfolios and not simply riding the bubble stocks all the way back down. 

**Don't get dejected or let a drop in your portfolio stop you**

And FFS don't be upset, sad or depressed if you hold a lot of COVID bubble stocks. What's happening is a great thing. It's the US economy's capital investment coming back to life and there's a massive field of investment opportunity out there in our country's companies starved for capital that they need to survive the rest of the pandemic. You can invest in them and they will reward you if you do. There is a lot of opportunity that you might miss if you don't engage.

**Don't randomly sell off stronger tech bubble stocks only to see them bounce back afterward**

Beware of selling stronger stocks at the bottom of a correction and then seeing them bounce back strongly right after you sell them! Think carefully about your exits as well as your new buys, if you rebalance.

**Good luck**

And don't believe the financial press when they tell you what's causing a rally or drop in markets. They make things up that are plausible to dupe lower tier and low-information investors while industry insiders gain first-mover advantage from your disadvantage.

And it would be great if people stopped downvoting posts that don't promote stocks that are in their portfolio. That thinking and behavior will almost always rob you of first mover advantage in a time of change._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in VOO and VTI Hi everyone. Thanks in advance for your help and opinions.

I started investing this past June and have slowly added a few thousand dollars to my portfolio for different things and right now VOO makes up 17% and VTI makes up 15% of my portfolio. I’ve used these to learn the market as a beginner.

Seems like they're going to be trying to acquire DirecTV again. It didn't work the first time, but they seem to be preparing to overcome the regulatory hurdles that are clearly going to come up. This would get them an enormous slice of the satellite market share. Ironically, the increasing availability of broadband cable in rural areas might actually help their case for control of the Satellite TV market. For some reason that I'm not entirely clear on, Satellite TV (and its sports packages) continues to be [the most popular choice for bars](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/kind-video-equipment-should-use-sports-bar-25048.html), even in places where Cable TV is readily available. 

Next is their recent acquisition of Boost Mobile. In an era of ever-increasing prices for new phones, Boost has been a budget service. It seems like the older demographic would be an obvious target, but Boost hasn't really focused on that group in the past. Additionally, Dish has some pretty clear ideas about how to change the existing structure to be [more profitable](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-eyes-changes-backwards-prepaid-business). They are also building their own 5G infrastructure, and moving off T-Mobile's network. This works as a 5G play as well. 

Lastly, my favorite aspect of this company is Sling. I see this as their avenue with the most growth potential, as cord-cutting continues to become more popular. There's already a good amount of competition, but Sling has been around long enough to have a solid foothold. Dish recently announced that they're [discontinuing support for the outdated slingbox to make room for new product offerings](https://www.slingbox.com/discontinued).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I am new with option trading and pretty much understand how it works. But there is one part that I don't understand.

Say there's a stock that is $10 right now. I am buying two different calls.
1. $10 C a week later.
2. $15 C a week later.

I know number one choice is more expensive to buy than number two choice.

Say, a week later, the stock price is $20. Which choice will make more profit? As far as I understand, the first choice made $100, and the second choice made $50.

Also, what is the reason people go for the second choice? Wouldn't the second choice bear more risk of the stock price not reaching $15?

Imagine investing in a company that ALREADY has an excess of $100 Million in backlog orders, which is the equivalent to its market CAP.

They will be releasing earnings mid month.

**Potential 3 to 5 bagger in the 12 to 18 months I feel.**

Dickson disclosed that the FAA was engaged with aviation authorities “around the world” as they prepare to validate its certification decision.
After the FAA gives its approval, airlines will have to carry out software upgrades and fresh pilot training that could take at least 30 days, noted Reuters.

Air Canada (OTC: ACDVF) CEO Calin Rovinescu said that the 737 MAX is expected to fly in the country early next year, as per Reuters.

Europe’s chief aviation regulator said previously that the regulatory approval to resume 737 MAX flights could be given in November and the plane could take to the air by the end of the year.

The European Union is imposing a 15% tariff on Boeing planes, which the planemaker dubbed as “disappointing and surprising,” Reuters reported separately. 

American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) said in October that it was planning to return 737 MAX jets to passenger service by the end of the year.

Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV), the biggest 737 MAX operator in the world, said it would take several months to adhere to FAA requirements and it would not schedule flights with the plane until the second quarter of 2021.

Why doesn’t everyone do this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pandemic 'stay at home stocks' like Peloton, Zoom, Roku tank on Pfizer vaccine news—is it an overreaction? Pfizer on Monday morning [announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-114500360.html), developed in partnership with BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in studies and that it could distribute 50 million doses before the end of this year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The good news immediately sent [U.S. markets broadly higher](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-9-2020-231320807.html)—especially airline stocks, energy names, bank stocks, in-person entertainment like theme parks, and real estate—except for a slew of key names that have seen huge gains during the pandemic, boosted by prolonged work-from-home trends.

Those “stay-at-home stocks” were hit hard.

Peloton ([PTON](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/)) fell by as much as 25%; Logitech ([LOGI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/)) fell 19%; Zoom Video ([ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) dropped 17%; CrowdStrike ([CRWD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/)) fell 11%; Chewy ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY/)) fell 10%; Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/)) sunk 7%; Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) fell 6%; Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) was down 4%.

The market thinking appears to be: a widely available vaccine will prompt a return to normalcy, which will mean the end of the hockey-stick run for products and services you use in your home.

But that reductive logic doesn’t apply equally well to every stay-at-home name. Rather, the post-pandemic prospects for each business have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

## Remote work won’t abruptly end with a vaccine

Since early on in the pandemic, analysts and experts have predicted that some form of [remote work](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-remote-work-boom-will-affect-salaries-jobs-and-where-people-live-190344317.html) is here to stay—after all, it was a trend already growing before the pandemic. If that’s the case, then many companies are going to continue to use enterprise tools like Zoom and Slack, even once offices reopen. Whether workers are in their office or at home, teams that use Slack aren’t going to just stop using it.

In Zoom’s case, the stock has also become extremely expensive. It trades at more than 800 times earnings, so it was arguably due for a big correction. The vaccine news provided an excuse for firms to take some profit and move into other names, like the battered stocks set to take off now that a vaccine is imminent. (As for Slack, increased competitive threat from Microsoft Teams is also contributing to its slide.)

The same “here to stay” thinking with the enterprise names can apply broadly to streaming services like Netflix and Roku: just because people might return to their offices doesn’t mean they will stop streaming at home.

In Roku’s case, the dip makes a little more sense, since Roku relies on ad revenue from ads on its home screen, and advertisers might indeed shuffle their budgets away from Roku if they think time spent on streaming will drop significantly. For Netflix, which makes its revenue from subscriptions (it doesn’t sell ad space or sell user data), the stock dive would only make sense if you think a significant number of subscribers will cancel Netflix after the pandemic.

Peloton is its own case: the exercise-bike company took off early in the pandemic amid staggering demand for its bikes, creating wait times of 5-10 weeks on orders. As the stock surged, some analysts warned of a “pull-forward in demand,” the idea that Peloton cannot sustain this level of sales and would be punished later on because shareholder expectations would get too high. But in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in September](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-new-highs-q4-earnings-and-revenue-202044922.html), Peloton had its first profit and showed massive continued demand for its bikes, making the bear case look wrong. (Meanwhile, Netflix, in contrast, actually did see in Q3, and explicitly identified, a [pull-forward in demand from the first half of 2020 that hurt its subscription adds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-q-3-demonstrates-the-dreaded-pandemic-pullforward-in-demand-193405344.html).) Once gyms fully reopen across the country, will Peloton bike sales really dry up?

On the other hand, Peloton stock, like Zoom, got extremely expensive (trading at a 15x P/E ratio), so it was due for a correction as soon as there was any indication that the end of the pandemic is in sight.

## Buy online, pick up in store

One good example of a trend accelerated by the pandemic that is generally expected not to reverse is e-commerce and the rise of BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) for brick-and-mortar retail.

[Walmart, Target, Best Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html), Urban Outfitters, [Restoration Hardware](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-restoration-hardware-stock-is-up-240-during-the-pandemic-180244236.html), and [Dick’s Sporting Goods](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) are just some of the physical retail names seeing enormous e-commerce gains, so much so that the share of U.S. retail spending attributed to e-commerce has surged to 16.1%, up from 10.8% one year ago.

Those chains have also seen [huge customer adoption of curbside pickup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/curbside-pickup-is-exceptionally-sticky-and-will-continue-postpandemic-mc-kinsey-retail-expert-183712446.html). Dick’s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said in August that Dick’s “anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off \[in curbside\] when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.” Many retail analysts predict that even after the pandemic, consumers will stick with their new behavior and shop online, for home delivery or curbside pickup.

Whole Foods CEO [John Mackey disagrees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-does-not-think-online-grocery-will-remain-the-norm-postpandemic-food-is-different-175009302.html)—he thinks some people will stick to online ordering, but that it won’t remain the norm for most. Even if he’s right, what that creates is a hybrid landscape for physical retail and physical grocery.

The same applies to remote work: even if a large number of workers return to the office, many more workers than before the pandemic are going to keep working from home, which should be good for enterprise names like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike.

Wharton professor Mauro Guillen writes in his new book, “2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,” that beyond the pandemic we should expect a “hybrid model” of working that allows for remote-work a few days a week, and continued automation of service warehouses.

“Most of what I hear from companies right now is that we're going to go to a hybrid model,” [Guillen told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whartons-mauro-guillen-trends-shape-203000781.html) in August. “So, a majority of American employees who are working from home now, they're saying, ‘Yes, I would like to have a remote component in my work week, but I would like to also go to the office.’”

Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell sounds a similar tune. He insists that the recent sales boom for Logitech’s computer accessories [can’t be totally chalked up the pandemic, but to four “secular” shifts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-ceo-4-trends-are-driving-our-sales-boost-not-just-the-pandemic-141208902.html): “One is video going everywhere, whether it’s offices or webcams. The second one is the rise of gaming as a professional sport, and as a bigger and bigger spectator sport; it’ll be the biggest collection of sports in the world one day. The third one is working from anywhere. The fourth is everybody creating their own content and streaming it, which lends itself well to our microphones. All four of those are long-term secular trends.”

But of course, Darrell has to hope so for his business. The other companies labeled “stay at home names” during the pandemic are all hoping their momentum continues, even once we get a vaccine.

> [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ As Biden gets in office, Gold and Gold mining stocks will shine. Trump was great for gold- low rates, big QE, booming deficits, etc. Gold has been up 50% since 2018. Imo this trend will continue. 

As were headed for 12th year in this bull market, it seems logical that it has to come to an end soon. I personally don’t think it will end. The Federal reserve will push the market upward at any sign of downtrend. 

The question is, how long can the dollar sustain its value with this much stimulus pumping in before it faces a major devaluation? I predict that in the short term, the stock market and gold will both rise together. Eventually the dollar will break downwards and push gold a lot higher; it could be in a month, or years. There’s no telling how long this can continue for, but eventually something will give out. 

With Biden in office we’re going to get a far more dovish fed chairman. Rates will stay at 0 and QE will be going on at a faster rate. Also, expect bigger deficits, Biden will be easier on China. Gold has a lot of momentum heading to $2000, but I still don’t think it has enough enthusiasm in the trade yet. 

I think gold needs to break $2300-2500 to really gain some interest. I especially think the gold miners will rise significantly when gold breaks that psychological $2000 level.

At $2500 gold, I can’t imagine where silver would be. Possibly $100? There would be tons of selling at $50 an oz. I could see a scenario where people hold onto it and ride it to 100 if it’s going up a weekly with a lot of momentum. I think $50 is just a huge barrier for silver that might be tough to break._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Problems with Investopedia Hi all. I play the Investopedia game, a stock market simulator.

Well, the stock did go up, by almost 8%!

But, it seems that Investopedia bought the stock at the 9:30 price when the stock was 41.92USD. Though, I wanted Investopedia to buy the stock at the 4 o'clock price when it was 36.4USD.

Would it not make sense for the stock prices to go back to it's pre covid prices or higher.

For example, Apple was at $79 around Jan/19 and now it's around $118. Would it not make sense that it reaches somewhere close to 80-100 once the vaccine is tried and tested.
