 Is GameStop worth a buy? Have noticed it performing pretty well recently and seems to have a lot going for it:

* Demand for video games growing

*  New consoles, such as PS5 seeing strong appetite

* New multiyear partnership with Microsoft

* Ryan Cohen from Chewy appointed to the board to drive a digital shift

My broker has the option to reinvest dividends and was wondering about how dividend reinvesting works if the dividend is less than the cost of the ETF?

I figure it would be in the best interest for both the investor and the issuer of the ETF to allow dividend reinvestment even if it's less than the cost of a share, but I may be wrong.

If it is dependent of the ETF  where would be the best place to find this information?

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top 10 largest stocks in S&P since 80s I was reading Distillate Capital newsletter today and one analysis they highlighted was quite interesting I think. Table below shows the weight of largest 10 stocks in the S&P index going back each decade to 1980, with the weights of those same stocks shown 10 and 20 years later where applicable.

[HTTPS://imgur.com/a/IziGbFY](Https://imgur.com/a/IziGbFY)

Looks like the largest stocks rarely remain so and this seems to be more true over a longer period of time. They suggest few reasons why this might happen:

* growth can become more challenging when base business becomes larger
* and economic change, innovation and new competitive entrants
* finally, valuation can be a crucial obstacle to remain at the top of the market. Rich valuation leave them at risk of a contraction in valuation where index weights shrink even if fundamentals grow.

&#x200B;

>While it is always hard to envision the largest and most dominant companies *at the moment* not being the largest and most dominant in the future, history suggests that change is likely.

&#x200B;

The analysis also concludes that the portfolio implication of this is that it may make sense for longer term investors to be biased against the largest stocks in the market unless their valuations are especially compelling.

QS seems to be the leader in solid-state batteries, and EVs are going to be a trillion-dollar market pretty soon. 

The problem is that QS's battery technology seems to have hit a snag. Limited recharges give it a road-worthy lifespan of only about 75,000 miles, according to an article I read but can no longer find. 

Ok, that's not good. But if the batteries are significantly cheaper, then does it really matter?  Most cars need some thing or another replaced or repaired around the 80,000 mile mark. If the QS batteries charge faster, are lighter and smaller, AND cost less, then maybe it's still a better mousetrap *even if you have to replace it every five years*. Like an oil change, more expensive but a lot less often. And think of the effect on the used car market -- fresh batteries and no engine trouble. If they can be made for half the price of current batteries and modular, it still sounds like a great investment to me. But that's a big ***IF***.

I am long BB due to it being undervalued (at least before the price hike) to other cybersecurity companies, its QNX system and the recent IVY deal with Amazon.   One of the things I noticed is that the short interest for this stock is very high.  I know that the current "meme stock" is GME and when I looked up GME on [Fintel.io](https://Fintel.io), it has a 20% Short volume ratio.  When I look at BlackBerry, the short volume ratio is 30%.

I thought that GME was a very heavily shorted share and that part of the theory behind it blowing up "to the moon" was that the shorts would close and drive it up.  So my two questions are: 1. am I misunderstanding the short volume ratio and 2. does that mean that Blackberry could have a short term price hike soon if it stays at the high levels it has been at/climbs more at all and then the firms/individuals holding the short interest close their positions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) N-1A Filing In 2020, all of Cathie Wood's ETFs were hugely successful.

( NOTE: sorry, mods don't allow youtube link. You can search for "ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) N-1A Filing" on youtube and it should show up) 

ARKX will go public some time after 3/29/2021.

Theme: Invest in companies that are engaged in leading, enabling, or benefitting from products/services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.

ARKX has 4 investment categories: Orbital Aerospace, Suborbital Aerospace, Enabling Technologies, and Aerospace Beneficiary.

Risk Factors:

1. Concentrate (>25% of the fund’s assets) in industrial sector and information technology sector.
2. Currency risk: a strong US dollar will negatively affect the fund due to the non-US stock holding in the fund.
3. Aerospace and Defense industry is heavily depending on US government’s demand and other government’s demand around the world.
4. Newly offered fund. No performance history is available.

Upside:

1. Credibility: Cathie Wood and the success of ARK Invest ETFs (ARKK, ARKQ, …)
2. Promising of incredible return
3. The fund’s portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated daily.

As a beginner swing trader, I seem to get into this dilemma often.

For example, on paper, stock X looks great with a lot of gains in recent months, while the index fund barely has a 5% gain in a month. But index fund is a future contract which means you get 10x leverage, which means your actual gains if you invest in an index fund are 50-100% which are much higher than individual stock that has no leverage .

Now you will ask me to multiple future contracts by 10. But it is not that simple. Every future contract has a different leverage requirement, which is a total brainfuck. Some CFD broke allow switching to 100x leverage which is another thing to worry about. Forex usually has 100-1000x leverage which is another problem.

&#x200B;

What are your opinions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in the FAANG, and finding the next potential member As a relative newcomer to (active) investment, I’m interested in people’s investment strategies regarding the FAANG, and rationale for trying to pick the next potential members.

In terms of how I rate the FAANG (and Microsoft) currently -

I’m bullish on Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. 

Amazon in particular seems set for further massive growth with AWS and delivery innovations. Apple continues to successfully move into new product lines, whilst dominating the top end consumer devices market, and continuing to offer at least some competition to Microsoft in the business space. Microsoft continues to monopolise the business space, and grow Azure. I have confidence all will continue to successfully innovate into new market segments. For example, I think Apple TV will get stronger, and Apple Music will begin taking a bigger bite out of Spotify’s market share.

Whilst it remains mired in controversy, and Biden appears keen to try and reign in their data privacy and targeted advertising, I’m confident on Facebook. I continue to view negative press as a good opportunity to buy the dip. While they could be massively constrained, and customers *could* just move onto other platforms (as I’ve often heard touted), they continue to have a large moat around social media. Noones managed to knock them off yet. WhatsApp remains very popular (particularly here in Western Europe), and I think there would need to be a new player with a better overall user experience in either category to actually affect Facebook’s moat. People may move to apps like Signal and Telegram in greater numbers. Facebook continues to compete and arguably has pulled ahead of Google in the advertising space. It’s also pivoted well into gaming (with Oculus), and the online marketplace (albeit competing more with eBay and Craigslist, rather than Amazon or Baba). I can see it faring equally well on payments.

Google continues to hold market dominance of the search and mapping space. I can’t see it losing this. It’ll also continue to remain competitive in advertising and operating systems, particularly for advertising revenue when society returns to the “before times” and more people are using it for everyday life. That said, Google has often tried and failed to innovate (see: “killedbyGoogle”). It seems to have stagnated, in the company’s inability to capitalise on some of their innovations. While it still retains some competition in areas like consumer electronics (Chromebools), the cloud and smart tech; it isn’t close to dominating those markets. I think Google will remain a very strong company for some time, and I’d pile in if it looked like a successful project was on the horizon - as we may yet see from self-driving cars and AI. 

Netflix will also likely retain its moat for some time to come, given the quality of the product and its user interface. Competition exists, but it’s a long way from seriously eating into their market share. They have had some (expensive) flops, but they continue to generate good content - particularly in documentary making. That said, for me to invest I’d want to see evidence of a pivot into trying to dominate another market segment. While Google has probably tried to compete in too many different areas of the market, Netflix hasn’t at all. Will it eventually look to monetise the targeted data it has collected on its customers?

Outside of the FAANG, Tesla has been a meme stock for its meteoric rise and potential to monopolise the EV space - though it remains to be seen whether it will continue to innovate, and hold this monopoly. If it can, it could well achieve FAANG-level market dominance.

What do people think are realistically the (large, medium or small cap) companies that have the potential to enter this level of market dominance? I’ve seen good cases made for NVIDIA, Square and Roku dominating their markets. Do you think this will be FAANG level, with the same ability to innovate?

There are clear trends that are likely to shape the future - EV and the wider renewable energy market, further environmentally-focused markets like meat alternatives, genomics, medical cannabis, payments and AI. How do people pick companies that are likely to dominate in these areas at this point, when there are so many players in the various areas? 

Do you also look at growth stocks in these areas, or areas like sports betting that are likely to take off in the US market, as solid investments (with the obvious risks) - given the potential to become large cap companies and dominate their sectors? I’ve seen the bull case for DraftKings, but much like areas such as genomics and medical cannabis, there are legislative hurdles to overcome, and other companies could rise to fill that space. While DraftKings is leading a lot of the sports betting push, it doesn’t have the largest market share, and when you look at Western Europe, you see how much competition there is; with no clear sector dominance. Are you looking to invest in a company that, by the potential to grow into a big player, could still see a huge return on investment, or are you trying to calculate and determine which companies could completely dominate their markets?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Crosspost from r/stocks - Fairfax Financial (FRFHF): an undervalued play on BB [Original post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1xtlc/fairfax_financial_frfhf_an_undervalued_play_on_bb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Inflation is getting increasingly more media exposure (https://imgur.com/A4gPirf). From what I know inflation can be a self fulfilling prophecy. If you expect your dollar/euro to be worth less 1 year from now, you would be willing to pay more for goods/services today. Hence the expectation of inflation causes inflation.

The stock has moved sideways for a while since the ARM acquisition is on standby pending antitrust reviews in several countries and the outlook is rather negative on the subject because of complications with ARM China.

This vaguely reminds me of Tesla initially being denied inclusion in the S&P 500, the stock went flat and down for a few months and the market was "surprised" when S&P eventually included them, which they could have done at any time.

Also I think they are poised to capture a good chunk of self driving with a system similar to Tesla based on vision (no lidar) and machine learning (not geofenced), which doesn't seem priced in.

So yeah, this is just a hunch, not serious DD obviously but do you think NVDA is due for a good pop once the ARM buyout closes?

Markets are continuously rising and it seems we're in a bubble. I have some cash to invest, so I was wondering whether markets are overvalued and that I should wait, or should I invest right away.

What I did to investigate this was to compare S&P 500 with M2 Money supply. My hypothesis is that the rise that we're seeing is because of the extra money supply. If that is the case, then the real question we should be asking is **whether market's rise has overshot the money supply.**

From the data, it doesn't look like so. Take a look at the historical chart of S&500 / M2 money supply.

[https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E](https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E)

You can play with the [dataset here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18S9anxRQAD6-865Mrdj6Xyr5DiFifSbef2AlFselWQc/edit?usp=sharing).

**From the data and the chart, it's clear that the markets may rise even further**. Reasons:

* The ratio reached its peak during the 2000 bubble, and the current levels of the ratio are much below that (although they're reaching the 2008 levels)
* Since early 2020, M2 Money supply has roughly increased by 24% while S&P has increased by 15%

It's also interesting to notice that CAGR of this ratio over last 40 years comes to be around 2% which is similar to the annual increase of US GDP.  Another way to look at this is that, the 8% annual returns of S&P 500 over the last 40 years can be broken down into two parts:

* 6% annual growth in money supply
* 2% annual growth in GDP

So, in some sense market's real growth has been simply the GDP growth.

What do you think about this analysis?

PS: Sorry, the data isn't very cleanly formatted as I did it very quickly._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any bears left? If so, what is your thesis? Markets rose a stunning 1% today, and tech rose 2+% across the board. Markets continue to reach new highs as the pandemic rages on. MANY of this subreddit were bearish back in March/April. The market has risen tremendously since then, with some stocks like Tesla rising more than 8 times their pre-pandemic value. If any of you were foolish enough to short, you would have suffered massive losses.

I am curious if there are any more bears left. If so, what could possibly be your thesis at this point? Vaccine is rolling out, interest rates are low for the next decade, a stable president is going into office, and trade war with China is finally coming to an end as China and US move towards friendship once again._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who is LiveSquawk and DeltaOne?

For the investing gurus out there, I came across this link regarding ESG, it is important that listed companies in the US to publish these reports so that investors can be kept up to date. Not to mention that there are so many environmental laws and societal norms which companies have to follow, coming from the top governance within the company.

​

What surprised me was that these chinese banks and companies are actually following suit with one of the publishers with top analysts covering these reports...

​

I think it is rather important to look at all these additional reports published by analysts especially this one by China Knowledge given the fact how volatile chinese market can be.

I've read up on the wash sale rule, but I was wondering if there was a minimum amount of time you have to initially hold the security before selling it at a loss for it to be 'eligible' for tax loss harvesting. For example:

1. I buy 100k in Stock X on January 1st
2. On January 8th, the value of my holdings in Stock X drops to 90k

If I sell it on January 8th, having only held it for a week, and I do not later run afoul of the 30 day wash sale rule, can I clam the loss for tax-loss harvesting purposes, or do I need to actually hold the security for a minimum amount of time before it becomes eligible to be used in this way?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some of the best ways to invest that also generates net good for society? Hi,

In my reading on investing, something that's always bugged me is the type of investments that are fundamentally zero-sum. Foreign exchange trading, for example, doesn't actually benefit anyone except the person making the trades, and all the wealth they accrue is directly a result of other people losing it.

Stock trading is better, in that at least the company gets a cash injection when their shares initially go to market, but after that when shares change hands, there's no mutual benefit - any benefit is because you believe your guesses of the stock value are better than someone else's guesses and the money you gain is money others lose.

What I'm getting at is that in my mind in a society people benefit from each other and all get better, and it feels scummy to gain my wealth by just guessing better than others, and taking money from them that I didn't earn through honest work.

I guess the ideal investment to me would be if I could offer people loans - they get the benefit of having X dollars now, I get the benefit of them paying me back X + Y dollars tomorrow. We both gain, yay!

Any suggestions for ways I can have my investments grow, that also generate a net positive for the world?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNDM - Highest stock potential in the entire market?  Should be one of the highest stock potential, if not the highest in the entire market. My **DD**

I'm not here to argue that Tesla is correctly valued, it's not, but the company is going to remain one of the biggest automakers by market cap even after the bubble bursts. You could almost call it a new normal.

GM has seen a huge uptick in growth thanks to their investment in Cruise. Cruise brings a lot of things to the GM company portfolio but the biggest one is a chance for them to actually survive and compete in a 21st century car market. I think it makes sense for the recent growth in gm because it this.

Similarly, Ford is beginning to get revalued too. I think a lot of that is due to their stake in rivian. Rivian has been growing at a fast pace and already has contracts with companies like amazon.

I use the Wealth Simple Trade app to trade in stocks that I like.

I had around 60 shares of CHU (China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd). After the news that NYSE will stop trading on this stock among others. I decided to sell them on January 08, 2021 (A little late, but I was extremely busy days prior to this)

My order was rejected on January 08, 2021 at 7:56 AM PST, even though the stock was still trading and fluctuating in price.

I contacted Wealth Simple and they replied after two weeks and here was their reply:

*CHU is currently halted from trading across the market due to restrictions currently in place in the US and there's no timeline on when these might be lifted. At the moment, you won't be able to sell your holdings but we will resume trading once the stock is trading again* 

I followed up and asked them if my order was before the halt order and here was their reply:

*CHU was removed from the NYSE on Jan 6 which is why your order failed on January 8 - at the moment these shares will be in limbo until an action is taken by either the US government or the company itself* 

I have two questions:

1. Was the stock removed on January 06 or January 08? If it was removed on January 06, why was I able to see the stock price fluctuating until end of trading day January 08?
2. If it did stop trading on January 06, what are my options now?

I've found a company that is *significantly* below book value, $GNW (Genworth Financials). The current price is $3.15, but the book value is $29 based on the latest 10Q.  Usually, I'm immediately skeptical of companies below book value as some of them may be failing (like Ford). However, Genworth has positive earnings and is generally making money every year based on the EPS and net income.

Furthermore, the company has $6 of cash for every share. I cannot fathom why GNW is so undervalued. I researched more and saw that they have been unsuccessful in being acquired for the price of around $5 a share. However, I do not see why this is bad at all, (being acquired for that amount would be a pity). Perhaps it's because Genworth is an insurance company. Is there something I'm missing here?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you accurately benchmark your returns? I've been grappling with the question for a while of how to accurately benchmark returns. It seems like the common wisdom is to either: 

* Benchmark against an S&P500 index 

* Benchmark against a sector fund most relevant to your portfolio (e.g. QQQ for tech or ICLN for clean energy...) or scroll through all of Vanguard index fund returns 

* Benchmark against a set percentage you use based on personal calculations for retirement (e.g. try to keep at least a 7% or 10% average) 

* Google around and see what people report as their returns on forums like Mr Money Moustache or Reddit. 

* Look at hedgefund reported returns(?)

But honestly, none of these options are all that satisfying to me at a glance, because it doesn't answer the question of - what sort of returns are actual investors from different age ranges, income brackets, risk tolerances etc. seeing in returns in any given year? This paints a picture of market performance, but not really a picture of actual investor performance. 

So my question is: how do you benchmark your portfolio's performance, and why is your choice satisfying to you?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Betterment Estimated Returns Seem Low Hi, don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but does anyone know why betterment’s Roth IRA predictions are so low compared to most other standards?
