Day Trading with a fulltime job I have just started a couple of months ago the exploration of trading and the stock market in general and was going to start paper trading Nasdaq stocks. I'm from Europe and work a 9-5 job and the market opens at 3:30pm in my timezone.

Was wondering if the market still experiences volatility after 5pm my time ( 11am US time)  as I read a lot about violent price action in the first 30mins of the open.  Does market close experience volatility? If yes should I try and tackle more market close opportunities?

I also see that they are mostly Canadian companies and i presume the majority of their income came from US customers.

Does anybody know when is the date? Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When calculating portfolio performance against a benchmark, do you include cash? I have read numerous articles on how to build a benchmark portfolio that matches your risk allocation, in order to fairly determine your performance. And, of course, there's the (totally evil) pure comparison to the S&P. Regardless of the benchmark, do you include your cash holdings when determining, say, your YTD gains?

This is sort of a question about convention—and what people would assume if somebody says they beat Index XYZ—but it probably makes a big difference if you include or exclude cash. 

If you exlude it, aren't you putting a $0 valuation on ready-to-deploy capital, even if you increase the benchmark by the same +$ amount?

But if you include it, wouldn't the vast majority of single-concentration, zero-trades portfolios (assuming the sole equity has a upward trend) be somewhere between tough and impossible to beat, depending on the cash holdings?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market and Options Summary for Nov-04-2020 ## Daily Synopsis

thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Russell 2000 Sucks Can someone please explain to me now the Nasdaq can be up 4% today along with the S&P up a couple percent and yet the Russell 2000 is down? It seems like this underperformance of small caps is just a normal thing now. I put most of my portfolio into small cap etfs like the Russell as historically, they have had more volatility and greater returns, which I am all for. I’m legit still negative from my initial investment years ago and it’s days like this that continue to get me heated. I see an amazing day in the market, like when was the last time QQQ was up 4% in a single day! Then I check my lousy small caps and just can’t seem to catch a break.

I've been following the release of the RTX 30 series quite closely, and as many of you probably know the supply has been extremely limited. I think that the people that want to upgrade their GPU or build a PC will postpone this until they can get their hands on one of these cards because they are better and cheaper than the previous generation. If you don't need your new GPU that urgent, you will probably wait until there is more stock available. Is anyone else concerned about this?

When I was invested I owned about 20 different stocks in about 5 different industries. I read on here often and definitely believe and follow the advice of buying and holding quality companies, and being I am young I would never sell for a loss since I can just hold until I get at least my initial investment back before looking for greener pastures, but am I diversified to much for my investment amount?

Hello everyone.

I am new to the online trading of stocks scene. It has been so far so good and a lot of learning going on. I have always wondered weather robo-advisors are of any use especially if i want to increase the investment amount. 

All information about robo-advisors as well as your thoughts and experiences are welcome.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long term growth with ETFs such as CIBR, SKYY, WCLD, BUG, IHAK New trader here. Only have around \~750 USD(I am aware this is a very low amount) in my account and looking to get started with relatively low-risk ETFs that could net me decent returns in the next 5-10 years. I've listed about 5 total ETFs and would obviously want to keep buying shares when I am able too. Keep in mind I am only 15, and want to start a discussion on these ETFs and their sectors, or even get some ETFs from you guys that I can look into and do research on myself. Thanks :)  


Another thing to note is that I'm most likely going to be keeping 80%+ in cash as the market feels really unstable now.

\-WCLD_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ advice needed for international student Hello folks,

I'm an international student under F1 visa with an American social security number currently studying full time in an American university. I wish to enter into the world of stocks but I want to make sure I abide by the law standards.

Online I haven't been able to figure out a few things such as, is there a limitation in the amount of money an international student can make? 
What happens then with taxes, how does one tackle this? 

In addition, I work what's considered full time max 20 hours on campus. Off campus work is only allowed on academic breaks which brings it up to 40 hours. Isn't stock trading up to my understanding - sort of - freelancing, what category is it?

Any advice, websites or guidance to resources would be deeply appreciated. Apologies for any English errors it's  my native language._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question Regarding Taxes When Selling Shares I realize I will be taxed only on my gains, but how is the gains amount determined? For example, if I bought 10 shares in February 2020 at $100/share, bought 10 more shares in May 2020 at $120/share, then sold 5 shares in 2022 at $200/share, will my gains be determined by the February 2020 price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you think nuclear power and uranium mining stocks will skyrocket in the coming decades? Why why not? I am considering investing in the above sector as a really really long play. Fossil fuels are predicted to run out when I'm a grumpy old timer. Solar panels and wind turbines are not efficient enough at the moment and rely on weather.

I’m a new Canadian investor looking to buy a growth ETF.

I new of ARKK, Cathie woods, and have looked into ARKK/EARK (basically EARK is the Canadian version of ARKK). What’s the difference between these? As a Canadian using Wealth simple trade, would it make more sense to simply buy Stocks/ETFs that are In CAD or is there an advantage to ARKK?

Third quarter revenue increased 57% over 2019 Q3

Recent dividend increase to .04/quarter (about 2% at current prices)

What I like the most is it's balance sheet

they just paid off their $425M RCF leaving a zero balance and a full $600M available.

This company looks like it will just keep growing. I am in at $6.50. Anyone else.

Hello , im a 22 old University student. I have saved up some cash (4000€) and im looking for some stocks to invest in and hold for long term 5-6 years. I’m planning on investing more as I get my hands on some cash._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Australian Stock Exchange Bargains to be had in the minerals sector which reported strong earnings but have pretty much reflected US markets uncertainty with mass depreciation:

NIC - Largest producer of Nickel in the world fully integrated, 50% growth in production capability in one year-30% value return, pre election was 60%

KLA - also available on NYSE i think, owns one of richest gold mines in the world in Bendigo Australia. Reasonable div.

Saracens- Long standing gold mining, about to undergo merger with Northern Star, speculative but should pump price if successful.

Edit: Thought would be better if this sub gave info on international stocks as well as US, informational efficiency on international stocks is much lower in my opinion and more bargains to be had._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $Lite (lumentum) Hey guys, I read into this company and I feel this is a great company to hold for a few short years to a really long term hold. They have more cash than debt and their products are future proof. They make lasers for industrial cutting and 3d sensors etc, and they are in the fiber optic networks and photonics tech business. Their levered free cash flow is 400m with 1.2b debt and  1.5b cash. The only drawback of them i see is that they aren't as diversified with clients as Texas instruments who doesn't have 1 client makeup more than 10% of their revenue, for instance iphone makes up something like 26% of its 3d sensor revenue. I cant remember how much Apple contributed to lumentums 3d sensors revenue but it was 26%.

Edit: found article and apple makes up 26% of LITE's total revenue last year. (Link to article https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/better-buy-lumentum-vs-texas-instruments/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
