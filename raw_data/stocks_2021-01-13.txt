 How much cash do you guys have? 
I only have about 1k in cash, the rest are in stocks and etfs. 40% of  my investments are in, what I call, "Safe" investments like Schwab ETFs, Apple, Microsoft. Stocks that I can liquid at any time with little to no loss and hopefully some gain should I ever need cash for anything.

What about you guys/._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 1/14/2021 -- ThinkOrSwim Chart Import Links Included :)! \*\*I use the 180D/4H chart exclusively to start with these. Then I use the RSI, Stoch, Vortex, and 10-50-200 EMAs\*\*

&#x200B;

$CANF - Obvious higher lows past consolidation zones. I think it has a chance to come back down to our channel too. Aim for $1.80 buy in. Stoch is low so that is good.

$CNCE - Obvious up trend. At multiple supports, and bouncing off the 50EMA. RSI fair, but Stoch and Vortex look good for a continuation.

$CRK - This is going to pull back. Not to $4.5 but around $5.0 most likely, look for a 50EMA bounce. Everything is overbought, but I do not want you to miss this.

$FLXN - Steady up trend, holding right above the 200EMA. Trying to break the POC currently. See if it can make it to the channel. Stoch is low and Vortex says we have a little more to drop.

$GERN - Is it finally reversing?! Holding support and trying to break 200EMA. If it dies tomorrow you have to wait to buy in. Stoch and vortex low.

$GMED - Steady up trend that aligns with the 50EMA. Holding support too. Stoch is low, and vortex show continuation. RSI Fair.

$GNK - Testing old resistance for support. Also holding the 50EMA currently. Stoch is very low, but Vortex and RSI fair at best.

$GSKY - Obvious up trend we have played 2 times now. Holding support and 50EMA. Reversals do take a week days so be patient. Vortex and Stoch very low.

$KPTI - No one jinx this, please god lol. Watch carefully... how often does this happen? Aim for a $15 buy in. All indicators show reversal soon as well.

$OPTT - While writing this it is showing life so who knows. 2 week reversal period so be patient, but watch this carefully. Wait for channel or 200EMA bounce. Indicators fair.

$PM - Currently at channel, support, and holding over 200EMA. Double bottom? Indicators are low, could be a nice continuation.

$TWNK - Pulling back to channel, it does have some space to drop. But 50EMA bounce is happening. Vortex low, Stoch low, RSI fair at best.

$VMW - Dying hard for a reason, for what IDK so check it out. But it will eventually reverse. In that are for one. Obviously all indicators super low.

$WEN - Great area of value. Done this 3 times now, just a great value. All indicators are low and reversal looking very promising here.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/bp-stock

This is a graph of BP's ADR stock price. Set it to 5 years.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?op=1

This is a graph of the Brent oil price. Or as people on WSB would probably call it, socialism oil. Set it to 5 years.

Now, have a look at the shape of the two graphs. Notice how remarkably well they track one another, with a discontinuity in 2020.

The current brent oil price is over $56 and has been rising. 

Even if you had no stimulus, no 0% rates, no background stockmarket bubble going on, to push prices up generally - using earlier parts of the graph, where would you expect the price of BP to be, roughly?

Where is it now?

What % gain would you make if the price of BP were to realign with brent as it generally has in the past?

Is demand for oil in the coming year post-vaccinations likely to suddenly rise, remain stagnant, or fall? (i.e. what would you expect to happen to the price of brent in the time taken for a realignment?)

Hence, I hold BP. Thank you for reading and for any comments below.

We soon came to realize that most of our work was completely the same as [www.cathiesark.com](https://www.cathiesark.com) , but we have since then added the change in amount of shares YTD, in each individual stock. This is to get an overview of what stocks are being bought and sold continuosly, so we can spot some of the opportunities that Cathie Wood and her team are seeing in the market, and which they no longer see (example: slowly selling out of EXONE CO/THE for several days). The changes in amount of shares are gathered from the email subscription from ARK, which is then added to the sheet and compared to the amount of shares owned in the individual companies at 12/30/2020. 

Besides these changes in positions, there are also added completely new companies in the ETF‚Äôs - you can see those in the sheet, with a comment ‚ÄúNEWLY ADDED‚Äù far right

AQMS, ABML DD: Battery Recycling is going to be hugely important in the coming years due to our limited amount of raw resources on this planet. Our use of batteries at this moment is growing exponentially for the foreseeable future. 

Battery Recycling is going to be a huge industry in the near and far future. Batteries need to be broken down into their raw materials so they can be renewable / reusable.

Think about how many batteries are going to need to be recycled in 10, 20, 40 years from now! We only have so much lithium and raw materials on this planet, so renewables will always be the future.

Their Chief technology officer is from Tesla. (He spearheaded the gigafactory). They have the land, permits, resources, brains and genuine enthusiasm within the company.

The CTO (formerly Tesla, and by all indications a rockstar) has been vacuuming up his former team and associates from Tesla. There are at least 5-6 former Tesla folks by last count. Even their COO is a former director from Facebook and by all accounts is a smart dude. I‚Äôm incredibly bullish on this little startup - they‚Äôre building something special. -- I am aware that it is a gamble. All the information above points give me confidence about this company and can see it only going up. Yes it will have some pull back days but I think this is really promising. The electric vehicle market has gone mental and I can see the American government & Tesla themselves looking to get involved with this company.

\*\**this is a loooooong play\*\* my time horizon = 30 years.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $DAC & Container Shipping  **Background:** Danaos Corp. owns container ships and leases them to other companies. This has been a beat down stock in the industry, often trading at 2-3 P/E due to debt and unfavorable conditions. The highest it traded was >$500 in July 2007 when charter rates were much higher.

**Opportunity:**

1. Due to COVID-19 backlog, charter costs are almost 3x from summer. Freight costs can be seen using the [Shanghai Containerized Freight Index](https://en.sse.net.cn/indices/scfinew.jsp) or [Freightos FBX](https://fbx.freightos.com/). Due to this demand DAC is able to take expiring contracts and book them at higher rates. In the Q3 earnings they stated they were already booking new contracts at 2x existing. These contracts are on average being booked for 12 months so even the new contracts will be renewing at even higher rates in a few months.  From what I gather other competitors have longer contracts and less ability to capture this price movement immediately.
2. DAC just completed a 4M share buy-back taking the total outstanding to 20M. They also lowered debt and debt service cost.
3. While unlikely, there may be a dividend in the future which was discussed in the Q&A of Q3 earnings

**Financials:** Q3 EPS was $1.91/share *BEFORE* the buy-back which was executed in October. When you take into account the buy-back it works out to $2.40/share. Expanding this to a full year we get \~$10 EPS at rates from Oct. 2020 (Rates are 2x higher since then). Matching PE of other companies in the industry (CMRE, NMM) we should expect share price to be somewhere between $50-$100 as contracts continue to turn over. And with prices moving up we may see EPS at $15+ so if P/E stays at 3 we can guarantee at least $45. The Q4 earnings report is 2/8 which will be telling.

*Note that I believe the other companies will go up with container shipping costs but from my readings I gather DAC's low P/E gives it a better tailwind*

**My background:** I have no affiliation with this industry or special insight. I found this stock by looking at top growth stocks and then looking at financials/investor sentiment. Do your own DD. My position is 275 shares and $35C 7/16.

I recently started following SFT and I gotta admit, I seriously like it. It's a very small company (market cap $707mln circa) so it's a risky one, but since I just added a lot of value stocks in my portfolio, I was looking for a high growth stock, a sort of bet (some time ago I was invested in SPCE, but I dumped it).

So, why am I making this post?Because I'm full FOMO and I'm victim of the confirmation bias. Every info and news I read, it's another buy signal. The used car market is something like $841 bilions and half of the transactions are peer-to-peer (people selling cars to other people directly), so Shift can seriously disrupt it. Also, this company remind me of Uber. They go city to city and try to expand their market power, slowly but steady (the idea is to expand in 2 cities every year, so it's a lot imo). Talking about competitors, the biggest one is Carvana but also Vroom can be a pain in the back, but the interesting thing is Shift is focusing on other types of car (older and less expensive one than Carvana and Vroom). Also, Carvana in expensive af (talking about the stock), so people that would like to invest in a digital car seller could find Shift interesting. Other than this, Shift recently received something like $300mln (with a market cap of only $700mln is a lot), they're due to expand. Lastly, I like the management. They are delaying earnings to expand and maximize the revenue. The idea is first of all to become bigger and bigger and then make profit (this is the second reason why they remind me of Uber).

So, again, why am I making this post? Because I'd like to hear from you guys some problems about this company. Do you think it's gonna fail? Why?

TL;DR: I like SFT, can you tell me some reasons why I shouldn't?

I have no income (disabled) but my wife and I do have $75k in savings, and my wife makes $110k/yr, so it's not like we're poor. However, my medical bills are substantial, so we want to be smart with our money (which is why we've stuck to VTSAX mutual fund).

My question is this... should we maintain our mutual funds with VTSAX and open a separate investor's account?

Today I bring to you the second installment of the Technical Analysis Series: Horizontal Support/Resistance, Confirmation Candles, and Volume. Check out my profile for the first post on candlesticks if you are interested in this type of content and missed it (it's one of my pinned posts). As previously mentioned, this series is geared towards the new trader who is trying to learn a bit about technical analysis. 

  
I would classify this installment as a "super installment", because a new trader can make great progress towards profitability and consistency by mastering these core concepts.  I have been technical trading for a little over eight years now and I still use these concepts for every chart I look at and trade I put on.  The reason I grouped these three concepts into one post is because they all operate together in order to be correctly applied.  So let's get into it.

  
**Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance**  
Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance are horizontal levels on price that technical traders and algorithms will identify as areas of interest for buying support or selling resistance. As time progresses and these horizontal levels get tested more and more, they take on increased relevance as key areas of interest on an asset.  Furthermore, once a resistance level is breached it will often be tested (wicked down into and bought up) and thereafter turn into support if upward momentum is to continue. Conversely, support will turn into resistance when the asset is trending to the downside.  For my personal trading, these historical support/resistance levels take on even greater significance when they line up with major moving averages, high volume nodes, and/or Fibonacci levels (concepts that will be explored in future posts).

  
For those that missed the candlestick post, here is a crash course in what I'm talking about regarding wicks: [https://imgur.com/gallery/V9YLjN9](https://imgur.com/gallery/V9YLjN9)

  
Here is a very zoomed out chart of Disney on the 3 day candle timeframe to illustrate horizontal support and resistance. There are quite a few more relevant support/resistance levels present on this chart, but I wanted to keep it clean so it's easier to analyze.

  
The 3 day Disney Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/fUxHC6Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/fUxHC6Y) 

  
The arrows on the chart highlight when these historical support/resistance levels are tested. As you can see along the bottom of the chart, this chart covers price action on DIsney from April of 2013 all the way to the present.

  
The "historical" nature of these horizontal support/resistance levels is emphasized in the following shot, where you can see that price levels from five or six years prior are still getting play and being respected by the market: [https://imgur.com/gallery/HbfcN5v](https://imgur.com/gallery/HbfcN5v)

**General info on Horizontal Support/Resistance**

* Horizontal Support/Resistance levels work on pretty much any timeframe, however they will have more consequence, and be respected more, on higher time frames.
* I generally apply historical support resistance levels off of the candle bodies (see candlestick post if you don't know what a candle body is). This is because price can wick over and under a historical price level, but if not closed over by a candle body I do not consider the historical horizontal broken (this ties in with confirmation candles which will be discussed shortly).

**Testing a Horizontal Support/Resistance**  
A close friend and mentor of mine explained technical analysis to me as the *art* of technical analysis, and this is a concept that has always stuck with me. Using these methodologies is not a science, and often a little bit of instinct and/or experience will make a big difference. Historical Horizontal Support/Resistance levels can and will be front run (i.e. bought up before the horizontal support/resistance) and/or overextended (i.e. sold or bought past the horizontal support/resistance). You do not always get a pixel perfect tap of that horizontal line. In the words of my buddy, "Close enough is close enough." As will be further explained shortly, confirmation candle methodologies and volume analytics can be extremely useful when dealing with these types of close calls.For example, here is an example of where the major Historical Support level of Disney was front run. This can happen for a lot of reasons, and in this case I would say it was front run (not by much, only around $1.00) because it was such a good buy opportunity from a risk/reward perspective.

 Nevertheless, I usually consider these wicks down to still count as tests of this Historical Support level. Close enough is close enough: [https://imgur.com/gallery/HpuU3ur](https://imgur.com/gallery/HpuU3ur)

  
Two main takeaways/solutions for this type of price action that don't quite make it to the horizontal are:

1. A trader can layer bids slightly above, on, and slightly under a horizontal in order to spread out the average price of entry, and therefore catch at least part of this price action.
2. A bounce or rejection off a horizontal like this, even if it doesn't tap the horizontal straight on, can be taken as a sign that the level is being respected by the market.

**Horizontal Support/Resistance w/ Liquidity Zone**

* Depending on the price action being analyzed, you can in some instances apply a second horizontal on the candle wicks, and this creates what is known as a "liquidity zone"  between the candle body and candle wick.
   * Liquidity zones can be established by prior areas of narrow consolidation that have a lot of historical price activity.
      * The general rule of thumb is that the more price action within a designated range, the more weight that area will carry going forward.
   * A liquidity zone is an area that is wicked into and many bids are filled along this area of interest. Frequently, the price moves away aggressively from these liquidity zones for a variety of reasons that can be succinctly  summarized: not everybody gets to buy the bottom or sell the top. When price does move outside the liquidity zone, it often does so in an explosive fashion.
   * Liquidity zones area a result of market dynamics and institutional order flow. Although beyond the scope of this post, the short version is that it is not a coincidence that liquidity zones are often established in the wicks right on the other sides of these historically significant candle bodies. Large institutions need liquidity to fill their sizable orders and they use the stop-loss orders placed right at the top or bottom of these candle bodies as a source of major liquidity to fill their bids. There is a lot to be said about institutional order flow and it will likely be expanded upon further in a future post. 

For example, here is a major liquidity zone on Exxon established off 2 week candles that has remained an area of interest for over twenty years: [https://imgur.com/gallery/tUsQdRa](https://imgur.com/gallery/tUsQdRa)

  
**Why Horizontal Support/Resistance vs. Diagonals?**  
When technical traders are first starting out, I often see that they love to draw diagonals absolutely fucking everywhere.

  
Their charts often end up looking something like this: [https://imgur.com/gallery/KUn6FIZ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KUn6FIZ)

  
& they start to look like, and probably feel like, this guyüôÇ : [https://imgur.com/gallery/SJQGkhM](https://imgur.com/gallery/SJQGkhM)

  
With a diagonal, especially one drawn out over an extended period, there becomes a wide range of where that diagonal support/resistance really is depending on where you are anchoring the first plot point and whether you are using candle bodies or wicks as the touch points along the diagonal trendline.

  
Diagonal support/resistances are valid and useful, particularly for things like rising channels, however for actual trading I will always see if there is a valid horizontal support/resistance nearby that I can use for risk management.

  
The reason for this is because I start every trade with the assumption that the trade will go against me.  Therefore, I need to know my risk profile for each trade and when the trade will be invalidated. In my experience, a horizontal support/resistance level makes things much easier to know where and when to put on the trade and where and when to take it off if things aren't going your way. In contrast, a diagonal support/resistance level may leave a trader unsure of whether the trade is really over/under that resistance/support level. Frequently, at least for me, this lack of confidence in the diagonal results in not taking the trade off where I originally intended. As a result, when the price moves further against you, the original risk profile for your trade is blown and you end up taking a bigger L than you wanted.

  
**Confirmation Candles**  
A confirmation candle is how I tell whether a Horizontal Support/Resistance level has been broken.  
There are two main ways to play confirmation candles and I use both methodologies depending on the current market dynamics I am observing:

1. Close over/under "x" price:
   1. Using this approach you want the candle body to close over or under the Historical Support/Resistance.
      1. Here is an example of Disney Closing over a Historical Resistance: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OxWF4vp](https://imgur.com/gallery/OxWF4vp)
2. Open and close over/under "x" price:
   1. Using this approach you want the candle body to open and close over or under the Historical Support/Resistance.
      1. The benefit of this approach is that it adds further legitimacy to the critical area being breached and further prevents one from buying a "fake out."
3. Regardless of the candle confirmation methodology implemented, a trader still needs to manage the risk on his/her trades. As I have said previously, these tools don't give someone a crystal ball into the future of the markets, they merely provide a statistical edge. Without proper risk management that statistical edge disappears.

**Volume**  
Volume is another important tool that when combined with one of the confirmation candle methodologies above can give a trader increased confidence in his/her decision making around a horizontal support/resistance level and hopefully minimize the frequency of losing trades.   
In general, you want the breach of a Historical Support/Resistance level to be accompanied by above average volume. When high volume accompanies the breaching of a key level it reflects that there is heavy market participation and a lot of action was done on the move. The benefit to above average volume being present during such a move is that it is much more difficult for an institution to be laying a trap during these periods. Further, it reflects that there is wide market consensus that this is the direction the asset should move.

  
The easiest way to tell whether volume is below average, average, or above average is to put a moving average on your volume indicator. I generally use a standard moving average length of twenty on my volume indicators, however I will sometimes adjust this depending on the timeframe or asset being analyzed.

  
Here is an example of volume being an additional confirmation tool on the breach of  a Historical Support/Resistance: [https://imgur.com/gallery/X52HWfQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/X52HWfQ)

  
Conversely, here is how using volume as an additional confirmation tool can keep you out of buying a fake out, even when using the more conservative open and close candle confirmation methodology: [https://imgur.com/gallery/gqBuYCF](https://imgur.com/gallery/gqBuYCF)

  
So, as illustrated by the above examples, Volume can be a very handy tool when used in confluence with Historical Support/Resistance and Confirmation Candles. 

On a final note, the methodologies outlined above can result in a trader missing trades because these approaches are too conservative to allow an entry in all scenarios. However, the markets present constant opportunities and a new trade is around every corner. Personally, I prefer to stick to rules such as those outlined in this post so that I can live to trade another day. Everyone is a genius trading savant in a bull market, but these tools may help a trader stay in the game when the tide turns. I hope this was helpful to all the new traders out there interested in technical analysis!

On Tuesday, Nvidia said it would launch an even more inexpensive desktop graphics card, the RTX 3060 ‚Äî without the ‚ÄúTi‚Äù designation ‚Äî for $329, in addition to the new laptops. Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the company‚Äôs next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.

As many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs. Supply problems were so bad, especially as many new games that required fast hardware were released, that even Nvidia‚Äôs older 20-series generation of cards saw significant markups from resellers.

This new product launch, however, should be a little easier given that laptop chips make better use of constrained foundry resources, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told MarketWatch in an interview._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ZM Planning A $1.5 Billion Share Sale That‚Äôs literally 10x it‚Äôs IPO price.

Have shares of this company in my portfolio thinking they have a strong diversified online social media business (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Some of these apps might be trending downward in the US, but I still feel they have growth potential outside the US (WhatsApp isn't even advertising or making any money for them yet and is insanely popular outside the US). 

&#x200B;

I don't have an issue with their business model of targeted advertising and selling data. They have to make money somehow and nobody is forcing you to join. My bigger concern and annoyance with this company is their constant need to get involved with political BS. Giving grants for election equipment, grants for "fact checking" organizations, and of course, recent censorship. This type of stuff drives away a significant chunk of your audience, which eventually means less revenue.

ASML? I've bought ADI several times in 2020 and am currently holding a 13%+ position. What are thoughts on whether or not it is a legitimate 5G / semi stock compared to it's competitors? What else is to be considered in relation to its earnings and so forth? I am trying to grow past just letting this go for a 13% profit because, as far as I can tell, my understanding (as layman's as it may be) of the company's role in the world and their earnings line up to make it an optimal long term prospect. 

ASML, being a 200B market cap, whose niche role in the chip market is something I'm choosing to hang my hat on and take as truth, potential competitor interference considered, is something that seems very attractive to hold long term. I would like to garner conviction behind the 100-500B companie's younger cousins. 

For instance, my broker purchased salesforce earlier in 2020, and I've been looking at their 50B younger brother, WDAY, and wondering as I go forward in conjunction with the market/what my broker is doing,  how it is safe to make some of these "risky" medium-long term moves on companies that are considered small. 

Being a new investor, please pardon my unavoidable short-sightedness. Definitely trying to attain some sense of long  term consistency here.

Welcome to Wednesday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)

# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday

*****

> # 1. Stocks set for modest drop
> * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week‚Äôs Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.

> * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target‚Äôs stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target‚Äôs same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. House to impeach Trump
> * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump‚Äôs first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.

> * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it‚Äôs not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It‚Äôs unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration next Wednesday.

*****

> # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment
> * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, ‚ÄúI do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.‚Äù

> * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week‚Äôs siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won‚Äôt remove him from office.

*****

> # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account
> * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump‚Äôs account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. ‚ÄúGiven the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump‚Äôs channel,‚Äù said YouTube, owned by Alphabet‚Äôs Google unit. YouTube‚Äôs decision to freeze Trump‚Äôs account follows the indefinite suspension of the president‚Äôs Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.

*****

> # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns
> * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.

> * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.

I have switched from cash to margin account, currently all my deposited cash is already fully invested. I do have a few questions that i haven‚Äôt found answers yet and would like to find out before making any moves.

1. Since all of my deposited money is all in stocks does that mean if I wanted to buy 2k of new stocks I would have to first free up 1k and then buy or I can just immediately buy?
2. Are all buy orders that I set and are above my cash deposits automatically considered then on margin or do I have ti apply somewhere to get a margin loan first?
3. If it comes to the point that the stock i invested in crashes and the broker has to liquidate my position will it only liquidate that position or could my other stocks also be in danger?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Invested in too many stocks(81 stocks!), need help trimming it down

Finally sat down and consolidated what I have invested using different brokers. I think I have too many stocks. Probably good for wealth protection, but not ideal for growth. Also, too much noise/work
trying to follow all these properly. Need to do some trimming.

Any suggestions?? Ideally, I want to limit it to 30 max.

https://pastebin.com/3sqiBqTP_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you know when to sell? I'm a very new stock market investor with less than $500 invested since last year. I'm starting small and wanting to learn about the market and how things go and slowly add more, but my question is how to you know when to sell? I have some stocks that are profitable but no where near the gains I'm seeing on some other stocks. I have a few over 100% gains and then a few that have stayed around 20-30%. I realize this is all just on a single year and 20-30% isn't bad at all but seeing these few that have taken off makes me feel like I'm missing out on better opportunity. Any advice?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ISO Steady 20 year return Hi all - I have 30k sitting in a checking account with no interest. I add to that 30k every 2 weeks ($400). Essentially, I‚Äôm saving this money for my kids to split when they get married, but a house, turn 25, etc. So, there‚Äôs about 20 years to go...

I looking for a steady ETF or Mutual Fund (does it make a difference) that can put the money to work. I have my own portfolio with individual stocks, so not trying to roll the dice and go all in on Plantir or something. Looking for something for a good return and steady growth for the next 20 years.

Initially I was looking for the high risk high reward options, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt their chances or having a nice present when they get older. Also - I‚Äôm 33 and have worked my ass off from high school to get to where I am today so haters, fuck off. I‚Äôll help my kids if I want!

Thoughts and opinions are appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | PLUG Power & GM | TSLA vs AAPL| AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-13] **Big tech struggles as small-caps continue to overperform. Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it‚Äôs one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED‚Äôs Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it‚Äôs unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it‚Äôs not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It‚Äôs expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It‚Äôs seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK‚Äôs Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren‚Äôt good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

Have a great day and see you next time‚ùó_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on buying and selling T+2 I‚Äôve been looking around for information on the T+2 rule on a couple different sites and they all seem to say the same thing. But I can‚Äôt figure out if it‚Äôs okay to trade on T+2 day or if you should wait for T+3 for the funds to settle. 

Here is the situation I‚Äôm trying to figure out. I sold stock ABC on Monday and then bought stock XYZ on Monday as well. Ally investing said I can do that in good faith as long as I don‚Äôt sell stock XYZ before settlement date of stock ABC. Since that‚Äôs T+2 that would make settlement date of stock ABC on Wednesday. Is it okay for me to sell stock XYZ on Wednesday or do I have to wait a day after the settlement date of stock ABC?

Are the funds settled for stock ABC at the start of the market on Wednesday? Or are they settled at the corresponding time I sold ie sold stock ABC at 10am Monday so settlement will be 10am on Wednesday meaning if I sold stock xyz before 10am today that would result in a violation?

Aftermarket hours, ARK invests 42,965 shares pumping the stock to ATH of 532. Aftermarket and we are up 2.92%. Would recommend call options or long term stock positions for less risk.

Catalyst is that the US government is paying $2.6B to REGN in order to produce 1.25 million dozes of their new anti-body vaccine. 
This is payout is 25% of their revenue of the year. 

Moreover, their fundamentals are solid. They have consistently beat their expected earnings. No doubt it will hit ATH of $660 by the end of the month or earlier.  

The technicals and news align perfectly with what happened with TSLA at 379 before it shoot through the moon. And the best part is that REGN has better fundamentals. 

They are a good company with a 52 week high of 600 and are trading at their lows. They have consistently met the earnings expectations. There is an expected leap tomorrow as the news on government contract is released. 

I am personally holding call options on this stock expiring on Jan 15 but I recommend going for long term. A good entry would be early morning on open after a slight pullback (probably 520-530). Price target would be 660 and Stop loss at 505.


[Regn News ](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/regeneron-in-2-billion-deal-for-more-doses-of-covid-treatment)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Theory of High Beta and Fair Value Hey guys, I wanted to share a stock theory I had come up with a few months ago. It revolves around Beta and Fair Value. I'm looking to see what you guys think of it, whether its good or bad, your experiences with something similar, or any general ideas about it. It may sound confusing but I can try my best to simplify it. Thanks!

The theory of High Beta and Fair Value is regarding a stock that you invest in that has a beta higher than that of the market (>1.00) but generally a stock with one, for example, around or over 2.00. This also has to be a stock that you have done a valuation on, using a dividend discount model or free cash flow model, or any other way you applied a value to the stock price. If you know about fair values then you know you invest in stocks that are "significantly undervalued" and you invest in them with hopes that the price rises to your assessed fair value. 

Well, the theory states that when you hold a stock with a high beta, say 2.00, that you will be achieving those returns on your stock until the stock price reaches it's fair value. When it reaches it's fair value, you assume that the growth has been captured and the stock is no longer worth holding because now even if the market goes up, your stock is at it's fair value and there's no fundamental reasons to assume it's stock price will continue up with the market. BUT, on the other hand, if the market were to go down, you would still be acknowledging your high beta negative returns, creating a high risk situation. 

Basically, this is saying that when you invest in a stock that is undervalued, with a high beta, you should only hold that stock until it reaches it's fair value then sell it, even in a bull market. If the stock reaches the fair value and you remain holding it you are now in a High Risk-Low Reward situation -> acknowledging all the high beta negative return and acknowledging no high beta positive return because the stock is where it was valued fundamentally.

[Visual](https://ibb.co/4s9rbqT) - this displays a price graph of the stock with a high beta(1.75 here) and a price graph of the "market". It has 2 scenarios, the green scenario is when the market increases, the red scenario is when it decreases. It also has a brown cross at the point in which we assume the stock has reached it's fair value, it helps you see how the price and market move after the stock has reached that point_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Jan 13, 2021 These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed posts.

I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains.

Hope this offers you guys some more info!

&#x200B;

The Oil Sector, just like everything else, has been impacted pretty heavily by the pandemic. Here I'm gonna discuss what's going on in the Oil Sector, and what that means for an investor.

&#x200B;

Lets get some perspective.

&#x200B;

[Historical US Airline fuel consumption](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp).

Lets look at the totals for the last five years.

|Year|Consumption (US gallon)|Consumption Change YoY (%)|Cost|Cost Change YoY (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|17,044,700,000|1.88%|$24,654,000,000|\-19.95%|
|2017|17,295,300,000|1.47%|$29,251,600,000|18.65%|
|2018|17,868,300,000|3.31%|$38,462,800,000|31.49%|
|2019|18,269,000,000|2.24%|$36,457,100,000|\-5.21%|
|2020|9,359,600,000|\-44.01%|$13,353,300,000|\-59.96%|

&#x200B;

Consumption is down a significant amount, and based on [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/655057/fuel-consumption-of-airlines-worldwide/), it's not expected to make a full recovery in 2021. Airlines represent [7.8% of worldwide oil consumption](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/fuels-aviation-and-shipping). The world Oil Sector is valued at about [$3.3 trillion](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-percentage-global-economy-comprised-oil-gas-drilling-sector.asp).

&#x200B;

Even if airlines were to make a full operational recovery and begin flying at similar rates to peak years, airlines won't be able to generate the same revenue. Why? [Look at where their money comes from](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp). Major market-moving companies [have already announced that they plan to significantly reduce coming to work and travelling for business](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-asking-employees-to-work-from-home-due-to-coronavirus-2020#in-july-google-extended-its-employee-work-from-home-policy-through-june-2021-on-sunday-night-the-company-extended-that-policy-by-three-months-starting-in-september-2021-google-employees-will-go-back-to-the-office-part-time-working-a-minimum-of-three-days-in-the-office-and-the-rest-at-home-1). To add onto that, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html). The means regular tourism and travel won't be kicking off anytime soon in 2021.

&#x200B;

If you are really interested in taking a deep dive into prices for gas, take a look at consumer [fuel prices, futures, and supply](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php). To help you better understand and analyze this information, check out this [information on how gas is priced](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/factors-affecting-gasoline-prices.php).

&#x200B;

"[The nature of the pandemic and social distancing makes weekly gasoline consumption a valuable proxy measure of economic and social activity](https://aei.ag/2020/09/21/the-most-interesting-chart-in-2020-u-s-gasoline-consumption/)." In other words, gas consumption will rise once people can regularly get out of the house. As I mentioned before, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html).

&#x200B;

Most important to note is that the [oil companies are actually working to maintain a good supply/demand ratio](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-commit-to-supply-curbs-sustaining-price-rally-11610452802) in order to promote stability and growth in the sector.

&#x200B;

**Now lets not panic.** Why? Because oil is arguably the foundation of the global economy. People *go to war* because they don't have enough of it.

&#x200B;

Looking at the  [SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch). This ETF represents the trends of the major domestic companies that operate in the Exploration and Production sub-sector of the domestic energy market. Take a look at its [Holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/XOP/#holdings).

Here how things are looking with the prices:

&#x200B;

||Date|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Open|03 Jan 2020|$96.12|
|Pre-Crash|19 Feb 2020|$76.52|
|Current|12 Jan 2020|$70.62|

&#x200B;

XOP is currently sitting at 75.9% of its 52-Week high, and many other stocks in this sector are in similar standing. Why? Because oil has a lot of room for recovery as we move forward into a new administration and start coming out of quarantine. If an investor puts his money in now, he might achieve some solid gains over the next 12-18 months.

**$CAG** \- Great area of value here. It may see $31 though if it doesn't get positive volume. All indicators point to reversal soon.

**$CDAY** \- Riding the 50EMA line, up trending channel as well here. Support close behind, good deal. Indicators look good, but RSI fair.

**$COST** \- Obvious up trend as well, at support, just broke 200EMA - now needs to come back through it. All indicators point to a reversal soon.

**$DRE** \- Up trend looks good, at support, POC holding, and 200EMA looks strong. Indicators are low as well, so it should reverse soon.

**$INVH** \- Obvious triangle here. It will break big one way or the other, we will see what it does. But indicators show it should head back up soon.

**$LL** \- Great up trend again here. 200EMA right below, and support area. All indicators are fair at best due to up trending.

**$LNT** \- This area is where reversals happen. May see $46 soon.

**$LULU** \- Beautiful channel up here. Right at support, 200EMA, and trend line up. Strong company, good fundamentals, should make a move up soon.

**$NOVA** \- Support getting testing with 50EMA bounce. RSI fair, but indicators look like their low and ready to pop back up.

**$O** \- Great value and area for reversals. This area may lead to a full channel move up which is great reward, low risk here. Indicators say reversal near.

2. What is the usual rate that you can expect. Also, what if the stock appreciates/depreciates in value, is the value determined daily or at the time they were lent?
3. Do you think it's worth it?
