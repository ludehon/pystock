 NGA VS NIO ? Due to the recent news I can’t believe that it will we go off after the merge! Am I the only one thinking it could reach 50$ or am I a daydreamer?  My only concern is that the price could go down during the change a little bit but the long term seems very nice!

What are your thoughts on these two bad boys ? Kinda curious_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ About to lose all of my ENPH and I’m not sure what to do I bought 100 shares of ENPH a while back at an average cost of $44 a share. 2 months ago, while the price of the stock was at around $130, I sold a covered call for May, 2021 at a $200 strike. Currently, ENPH is floating around $205 and will probably be way over $200 at the time of expiry in May. I would really love to hold on to my ENPH shares (I know, I’m dumb for selling the call, but I didn’t think it would skyrocket as quickly as it did). It would cost me about $4000 to buy back the call and I just don’t think I can justify that. What’s your general opinion on ENPH? Does it have more room to run past $200, or should I just accept that I’ll lose the shares and dedicate my capital towards something else?

Now that we're under way with 2021, I've decided to update some of my strategy going forward. Since furlough from the Coronavirus continues to keep me pretty unoccupied, I've taken over short-term trading in an attempt to give myself a new hobby.  


A lot of people I talked to said they like to shoot for +30% gains on a holding. In the last quarter of 2020, I was trying to be modest around 20%. I figured that gave me some room to make up for the short-term inexperience. It was a decent quarter, I banked some nice gains and sold them so they were realized, however the more I've been doing this, the more I keep hinking about other strategies.  


I noticed that frequently it's not difficult to hit +10% on a trade. The typical daily volatility seems to have proven to me that in many cases, the fluctuations could allow me to achieve 10% in a relatively short time frame - depending on which stock it is. What if I changed my strategy and worked to have my broker automatically execute sales when it hits 10%? I think realistically I could hit +10% on 4 trades in a 2 month period - whereas it would probably take me 2-3 months to hit +30%, and that involves some serious luck that I pick the right stock to grow that high. But back down at the 10% level, that's something attainable in most stocks, as long as I watch the pattern and try and catch a swing.  


TL;DR: I'm thinking of making short-term trade targets +10% instead of +30% because I believe that I can cycle through tickers faster and make more money overall... What does everyone else think about a strategy like this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividend or ETF play? I am considering to deploy 3K into the market in this week. Here is what I am thinking of so far:

1. Dividend Play
Invest in T and O
T - $1500 ($28.75/share = ~51 shares of T = ~$102 in dividends/yearly)
O - $1500 ($57.81/share = ~25 shares of O = ~$70 in dividends/yearly)

2. ARK Play (Growth)
Currently have few ARK shares already..so I would deploy into the following 4 ARKs
ARKK  - 1k = ~7 shares
ARKW - 1k = ~6 shares
ARKF - $500 = ~9 shares
ARKG - $500 = ~4 shares

3. ETF Play (Growth)?
Invest in ICLN, TAN, QQQJ
ICLN -1k = ~31 shares
TAN - 1k = ~8 shares
QQQJ - 1k = ~31

4. Open for ideas :)

1) Consistently high annual growth to shareholders, actually besting Apple by 3% per year on average (25% since IPO)

2) Very strong fundamentals, although P/E ratio
is high at 45 the PEG ratio isn’t, it’s 1.6 (non GAAP adjusted) which is significantly lower than for example Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc which are trading well above 2 and up to 4.

3) A balance sheet to die for, positive net debt. Yes. They have more cash than debt. They also buy back a ton of stock with this cash. 

4) Profit margin of 40% and FCF margin about the same so the profit is real. Real yummy cash flow. Consistent margin improvement, 20 to 40% and improving even more.

5) Set up for future trends with growing social media usage and a SaaS business model. Can expand document signing business, lots of total accessible market available in all parts of the business.

6) With their cash flow, balance sheet and size they could be an aggressive acquirer. DocuSign should tremble. A combined offer of cash and Adobe shares could easily sway DOCU sharesholders for example.

It seems like they have been a little forgotten. I think this is a good opportunity to get in. I have a price target of 600 in December and continuous 20% annual returns.

Holy shit people, use the damn search feature on Reddit.

Lastly, use the god damn search feature. Multiple posts like this degrade the subreddit to some degree.

What are your thoughts on the company and their technology?

Is this a bettery buy than NIO?

BYDDF/BYDDY is stock is backed by 30% ownership by Warren Buffet.

Blade Battery

“The launch of 'blade battery' demonstrates BYD's resolution to thoroughly solve the pain points of NEVs and our better capability in guiding global battery industry back on track, so as to put an end to spontaneous combustions in EVs,” said Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD.

At the launching ceremony, the automaker highlighted a video of the “blade battery” successfully passing a nail penetration test, which is seen as the most rigorous way to test the thermal runaway of batteries due to its sheer difficulty.

The “blade battery” is named according to its shape, which is more flat and elongated than traditional square batteries. According to BYD, the singular cells are arranged together in an array and then inserted into a battery pack. Due to its optimized battery pack structure, the space utilization of the battery pack is increased by over 50% compared to conventional lithium iron phosphate block batteries.

Super Hybrid Battery

According to BYD, the DM-i is a hybrid technology which is largely based on electricity. Powered by a battery pack with ultra-large capacity, a vehicle using DM-i is primarily driven by a high-power electric motor wrapped by flat wire. A gasoline engine is mainly employed to generate electric power when running at a high-efficient rotational speed and directly drive the car at an appropriate time. Compared to the vehicles adopting traditional hybrid technologies, the DM-i-enabled vehicles are less reliant on engine and fossil fuels, so that the fuel consumption will be significantly decreased.

\- There are already a ton of knock offs including some that are compatible with the PTON app

Possible Connections With Tesla. Talon Metals Corp (TLO.TO) is a nickel-copper-cobolt green project based out of Minnesota USA, with possible connections to acquiring a massive contract for providing nickel to Tesla for their vehicles. They are positioned to be the only provider of green nickel in North America to supply not only Tesla, but all other EV companies.

Green Nickel is nickel that is mined and sourced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Talon Metals Corp does not mine using open pits. They use drill cores to map outcrops underground, allowing them to take exactly what they need and leave the rest.

In recent analysis the Tamarack Nickel Project has found roughly 8% nickel, 3% copper and smaller tract amounts of cobalt, gold and lead in their raw ore deposits. Talon Metals is currently able to produce 8.8 million tonnes of raw ore per year. Their website has a lot of great information in regards to drilling and mineral information, potential future expansions, goals and how nickel is a key assent in EV's. 

Musk has been quoted as saying the following in an investor meeting...
"Well, I'd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long - some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel," Musk said.

Nickel is so important to the EV industry because it's used to produce and extended range on EV batteries. Tesla's EV's use between 60kg and 126kg of nickel for every car battery depending on the make and model. The demand for nickel will only increase as EV cars become more prevalent as we head into a more environmentally friendly future. 

At open today (January 12th 2021) TLO.TO opened at 0.53 and I believe in the future this affordable stock is very well positioned to exceed all expectations with the way the world is currently treading towards being more eco friendly. Please as always do your own DD and good luck!

Financial analysis: 

Cash on hand: 34 M. 

Revenue and earnings: 3.4 M revenue last quarter, increase from 2.2 at the same time last year. Net income of negative 2.7 M. Of the 3.4 M in revenue, 0.46 came from SaaS digital services while the other 2.9 came from clinic services and pharmacies. 

Assets and liabilities: Current assets are 36 M. Total are 55 M. Current liabilities are 4 M. Total are 8 M. 

Operating expenses: Over the last 9 months it was 4.4 M. 

Market cap: 378 M. 

Sales over the last year: 12.3 M. 

P/S ratio: 31. 

Shares outstanding: 165 M shares. 27 M warrants and options. This is a nice ratio. Other good news is that insiders are buying more shares. However, CEO doesn’t have too many shares. This is not ideal. Float is also not ideal. Tight float is what you want. A tight float is less than 100 M outstanding shares. 

&#x200B;

Competitors: 

WELL Health Technologies and Teledoc Health. Was pleasantly surprised with WELL. Nice website. Very user friendly. The P/S ratio of WELL is 23. The P/S ratio of Teledoc is 36. As we know, the P/S ratio of CloudMD is 31. This means that WELL is the most undervalued out of the three.

However, I will be sticking with CloudMD. I'm very happy with the fundamentals of the company and I see great growth coming its way. 

&#x200B;

Other info: 

Nice website. User friendly. Investor friendly. 

Several investors with great track records that I follow are also bullish on CloudMD. This gives me confidence as well. 

Most of the info I used on this due diligence came from the September 30 quarter 3 results. A lot has happened since then, and the company is in even greater shape. 

Price Target: 

I can see CloudMD hitting at 7 dollars this year and at leasts 10 dollars next year. 

&#x200B;

Final thoughts: 

I'm very bullish on CloudMD and on the telehealth industry. I like the financials and the fundamentals of the company. I've also heard great things about the CEO. It's always important to have a good CEO. I see more acquisitions and more expansion coming. I believe the company will see great revenue growth in the coming quarters. The price right now is at a bargain. There is no way it should currently be at what it is. One day, probably sooner than later, the stock price will go up considerably. 

I also think it's a good industry to be invested in during a pandemic. Unlike restaurants or airplanes, a pandemic does not affect the healthcare or telehealth industry. It accelerates it. However, what I like about this sector is that despite this acceleration, I believe it will continue to thrive even after the pandemic.

Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.

We saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small & mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors & drug manufacturers.

[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don’t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.

In some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.

Moving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more & more with Amazon in the online retail business.

In the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.

We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ’s vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer & Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

Also, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer’s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.

And in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it’s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.

And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It’s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.

**What is NEL ASA?**

Nel is a global, dedicated hydrogen company, delivering optimal solutions to produce, store and distribute hydrogen from renewable energy. We serve industries, energy and gas companies with leading hydrogen technology. Our roots date back to 1927, and since then, we have had a proud history of  development and continuous improvement of hydrogen technologies. Today, our hydrogen solutions cover the entire value chain from hydrogen production technologies to  hydrogen fuelling stations, enabling industries to transition to green hydrogen, and providing all fuel cell electric vehicles with the same fast fuelling and long range as fossil-fuelled vehicles – without the emissions.

**Why am I interested?**

2020 has been an accelerant to the move into greener, more sustainable energy. EU wants to be carbon neutral by 2050, China by 2060 and soon the US (once Biden is in power) will also want to be carbon neutral by 2050 + Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure and renewable energy plan.

Most people believe that battery power is the future. In my opinion it is, but not on its own. Current battery tech is limited often in range, we are in the works of inventing new types of battery (Look at Quantumscope) however, before they are commercially available on large scale, cost efficient is still years away.

Hydrogen is nothing new. Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on planet earth meaning access to this type of renewable energy is basically infinite. By using electrolysis, Hydrogen can be produced from water and renewable energy. However, green hydrogen is becoming more and more affordable to produce, meaning that start to finish no CO2 is emitted and we are nearing in this decade large scale green hydrogen production.

Multiple projects have been started in the EU over the last two years and I believe this trend will continue on, also in line with carbon neutral plans of at least two large nations in the world.

Applications for hydrogen are very broad

\- Industrial use (Examples: oil refining, ammonia production, steel production)

\- Transportation (Limited low carbon fuel available as present; Hydrogen opportunity// Fuel cell costs also important)

\- Buildings (replacing natural gas, direct use for boilers or fuel cells)

\- Power generation (leading for storing renewable energy; can be used to increase power system flexibility; ammonia can be applied in coal power plants to reduce emission)

**Why Nel ASA?**

Q3 Highlights

* a screenshot of Q3 ER presentation should be here, but not allowed to add image\*

\- World’s largest electrolyser company.

\- €242 million cash (enough to cover R&D and burn rate).

\- Excellent group management with experts from varied industries.

\- 3-Yr revenue growth 74.05% // 5-yr 112.19%.

\- Revenue has improved YoY since 2014, not yet profitable but close too.

\- Entered MoU with Iberdrola to develop green hydrogen plant in spain. Capacity 200MW. Operational 2023.

It is not necessarily a play which seems safe at the moment, as financials are not positive yet, however are improving, I am holding this stock till at least 2025. They also have enough cash to cover operations. In the annual report they do mention that once they are in a position to pay dividend they will, however that is not the play here. I have been vested in this company for over a year and I strongly believe in it. The company is growing steady, more and more projects in the backlog, awarded multiple government grants over the last 6 months. It is a renewable energy play for the coming decade (imo)

&#x200B;

Most Recent Contract:

\- EverFuel Contract for Fredericia Hydrogen project – 20MW electrolyser to be delivered in 2021 and fully operational mid-2022. Value: €7.2 million

This is a long term play, I believe in a hydrogen future. Not just for transport, but power and storage as well.

T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTOO) announced that its T2SARS-CoV-2â?¢ Panelâ??a molecular diagnostic test that detects SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infectionsâ??is capable of detecting the multiple variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus most recently identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and the United States.

"As new strains of the COVID-19 virus emerge, it is critical that we ensure our technology continues to be an effective diagnostic solution during the ongoing pandemic," said T2 Biosystems' President and CEO, John Sperzel. "I'm proud that we can confidently say, after extensive analysis, that our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, which has demonstrated clinical sensitivity of 95 percent and specificity of 100 percent, can continue to help impact lives by detecting multiple variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."

Both the variants identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) contain multiple mutations, most reflected in the S gene, which encodes the spike protein. To confirm that the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel would detect these variants and other potential mutations of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, an in silico analysis was performed using genome sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database and GISAID database.

Over 42,000 genome sequences for SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for alignment with primer and probe sequences from T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel. This analysis demonstrated that the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel should detect 99.99% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses based on sequence alignments. A specific analysis of sequences for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants confirmed that the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel should be able to detect these variants.

The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel provides results in under two hours utilizing an upper respiratory swab sample. The test runs on the Company's FDA-cleared and fully-automated T2DxÂ® Instrument, which is capable of performing seven tests simultaneously and up to sixty samples per day.

The same T2Dx Instrument is also capable of running the FDA-cleared T2BacteriaÂ® Panel and T2CandidaÂ® Panel. These panels are the only FDA-cleared assays for the detection of sepsis-causing bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from whole blood in three to five hours, without the need to wait days for blood culture results. By providing quicker results, the panels enable clinicians to target therapy faster for their patients suspected of sepsis, often before the second dose of antimicrobial medicine is administered, leading to better patient outcomes, improved antimicrobial stewardship, and reductions in length of stay in the hospital.

These additional panels remain especially clinically relevant during the pandemic, as data suggests that the COVID-19 virus can lead to sepsis, and death._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VFIAX (Mutual fund) bs VOO (ETF)

The concept of a Net-Zero Project is to convert renewable energy (photosynthetic, wind, renewable natural gas, biogas) from a variety of sources into energy dense liquid hydrocarbons, that when burned in traditional engines, have the potential to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the whole lifecycle of the liquid fuel: from the way carbon is captured from the atmosphere, processed to make liquid fuel products, and including the end use (burning as a fuel for cars, planes, trucks, and ships). Gevo announces that its project currently planned to be constructed at Lake Preston, South Dakota will be the first Net-Zero Project and will be named “Net-Zero 1.” Gevo expects that Net-Zero 1 would have the capability to produce liquid hydrocarbons that when burned have a “net-zero” greenhouse gas footprint.

(Not relative strength index) I am reading some conflicting ways to calculate this indicator.

Let's say Stock XYZ rose 23% in the last year, and S&P500 rose 16% in the last year.

Wikipedia says " divide the percentage change over some time period by the percentage change of a particular index over the same time period "

So for my stock:  23% / 16% = 1.43. That's Relative strenghth of 1.43

Stockopedia says " A stock falling by 20% versus an index rising 20% would lead to a Relative strength calculation of 100 \* ( 80/120 - 1) = -33% "

So with my stock rising 23% and the index rising 16%:  100 \* ((123 / 116) -1) =   6.03

Wildly different numbers.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Despite already climbing almost 200% since the announcement of the Yeezy Gap line, I still think GPS can go a lot higher, assuming the US market stays strong into the Biden administration. Kanye is in the news yet again and is poised to remain there throughout the entire year as he potentially splits from  Kim Kardashian and rolls out his first ever mass-produced line intended to be affordable and accessible to all. The reality is, I don't think you could possible manufacture more Kanye clothing than what his loyal fanbase will buy up. Kanye's influence over fashion is consistently underestimated and I think this transition will be no different. I think Gap/Old Navy will—if handled right by their marketing and design staff—experience a complete brand recreation with the public. I think it could be a very similar resurgence to what Hanesbrands' Champion pulled off in the last five years, and New Balance as well. Champion used to be the cheap gym sweatshirt, now their basic white or grey hoodie is over $60. New balance 'dad shoes' are cool again. I see no reason why a 'kiddy' brand like Gap can't pull off a very similar comeback once hypebeasts start pairing their YZY Gap with their overpriced joggers and sneakers. The only way I could see this falling through would be if Kanye is never able to bring his clothing to market (which is certainly possible) or that Gap foolishly fails to bring some flavor and energy to their marketing/design team to capitalize on the momentum Kanye will continue to bring.

Seems like infrastructure/industry (and of course clean energy) is doing well generally with the incoming government, but I'm trying to brainstorm some specific ideas that would take advantage of GND-type incentives. Insulation (OC, BLD?), the HVAC industry (especially those making high efficiency heat pumps like CARR, TT), LED lighting (GE? lol), and window manufacturers (JELD?) could all have a part to play, but I'm not sure exactly what.

They're very smart people and their logic seems sound but I have no experience or knowledge in this field so I have no way to argue with them even if they're wrong/off. They aren't day traders (although I could be wrong with definitions here), but they do think that if they invest they will make large returns in the long run--in other words they're not selling often, just buying in companies they think will be big. These are mostly tech companies like Tesla, AMD, and a plethora more that I'm unfamiliar with. Some of them seem to think they'll have millions by the time they're 40 (we're all about 20 right now). I'm curious if this is possible, likely, etc..

None of them have currently pursued job training or college degrees and it might be a few years but I could see them making more in the future).

[Investors business daily article  from today](https://www.investors.com/news/ev-stocks-lordstown-hits-orders-milestone-faraday-in-talks-to-go-public/)

I have no position in RIDE._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: This is a good time to be skeptical of EV startups At the height of the dot-com boom in '99, investors were so caught up in the rise of a new industry that they threw money at anything with a website, regardless of the fundamentals. With the incredible rise of TSLA, I think we are at risk for a similar phenomenon with EV startups. It seems like everyone and their dog has an EV company right now. If you have a website and a flashy design concept, there is a lot of money to be made with investor cash.

**I am not saying don't invest in these startups, but there are a few things to keep in mind:**

* It's incredibly difficult and capital-intensive to start a car company. History is littered with failures in this industry (See Fisker, Faraday Future, Delorean, etc.).
* Elon Musk is a savvy businessman, shrewd technologist, and a master of publicity. He is the exception among startup CEOs, not the rule. He built Tesla with a diligent plan; and even then barely made it at times (See original roadster launch issues, Model 3 production issues). He is Tesla's greatest asset and we shouldn't assume that his success can be easily replicated.
* Traditional car companies have been slow to start, but they now realize EVs are the future and are starting to come out with their own models. While EV technology may be new to them, they have a huge advantage in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and expertise that will make it even harder for EV startups to gain foothold in the market.

The bottom line here is that investors should have realistic expectations about the chance of a new company's success. Investors who missed out on TSLA will be driven by FOMO to throw money at anything with four wheels and a battery. This can attract scammers (See Theranos) who want some of that easy capital. It's smart to be vigilant when there is so much hype around a particular industry.

**$AMZN** \- Absolute beauty of a triangle. A break put either way will be happening, and I hope up. RSI is oversold, Stoch low, and Vortex consolidating. It is at support, this could be massive.

**$BTG** \- Great value here, possible low of $5.00. Channel play possibly developing. All indicators are super low, this could be a big move. 

**$CDXC** \- Great area of value at support here. Good channel play, may drop to $4.50, which would be ideal. All indicators are fair but Stoch is low which is also good.

**$CERN** \- 50EMA bounce play possibility. Support area as well. May dip to channel of value as well. Indicators are fair at best as it is stull up trending.

**$EMP** \- Area of value channel right here, possible support. It did break so we shall see. Indicators are low, so a reversal is upcoming.

**$ERIC** \- Gorgeous channel up here, at value and above 200EMA. Support area, double bottom, great setup. Vortex and Stoch super low which is great.

**$GRBK** \- Volume resistance acting as a support, channel up, and support -- above the 200EMA line. Stoch low, but other 2 are fair at best.

**$GRPN** \- Old resistance as a support now, and old pattern resistance as support too? Stoch low, Vortex Low, RSI fair.

**$KPTI** \- Possibly 200EMA bounce but I will be greedy and hope for $15. But this is a support area it could be huge. Stoch and Vortex low, could be some really big move here.

**$LAMR** \- Channel up, right now at support and 50EMA. If it lives here it could be a great play. Stoch low but other 2 consolidating.

**$MLCO** \- 200EMA and support working together right now. Stoch and Vortex low which is good, this could be another easy 5% move.

**$MORF** \- Uptrend, 200EMA line and support as well which is awesome. Indicators are all low so that also great. Real nice calm setup.

**$MTOR** \- Up trending channel that is bouncing off the 50EMA lines. 

**$PEAK** \- Uptrend / triangle forming here which is gonna be awesome. Support under it as well, so it can make some easy money. Vortex is very low.

**$PGEN** \- Uptrend channel also at support, if it lives here we will be in a great position. All indicators are low and curling up.

**$PNW** \- Double bottom at support, and looking to reverse. All indicators are low so we should see a reversal soon.

**$RVP** \- Simple up trending channel. Bouncing off the 200EMA, and near support. Indicators all fair at best but it is looking good.

**$SUI** \- Ascending Triangle looking tasty here. Vortex low, Stoch fair, and RSI fair, but that makes sense. If it goes the full move here it will be a big breakout.

My hypothesis on the cannabis industry is that there aren’t going to be big “winners” when it comes to grow operations and production of cannabis. It’s such a saturated industry that, when mature, I think it will be tons of smaller producers. 

With this in mind, my opinion is that companies who provide tools to these producers will be the ones to invest in. Think Home Depot for cannabis. Companies that sell the “picks and shovels” of the industry. Do you all know of any leading publicly trading companies like these?

Granted, the latest $1.3 billion offering isn’t exactly equity offering at least for a few years but Nio has raised close to $4 billion in a matter of 2 months? Purpose of the latest offering is to strengthen Nio’s cash and b/s positions instead of supporting growth initiatives. For early Nio investors, they would remember Nio was once running out of cash in early 2020 prior to being bailed out by government funding. Should we be concerned with Nio’s cash burning history?

Nio’s release of its first sedan was delayed on multiple occasions partly due to the pandemic. Based on the latest timeline, it won’t be released until Q1, 2022. Also, ET7 is a premium sedan instead of a mass market sedan. While I understand Nio goes for luxury branding, It seems to me Nio’s decision to hold off on mass market vehicle is because it cannot yet handle the production volume of a mass market vehicle. As of now, Nio is still not vertically integrated and still has to pay JAC a fee for every vehicle produced and compensate JAC for any operating losses for the first 3 years of the joint venture. Li commented that Nio will consider a mass market vehicle rollout under a different brand when costs start coming down. I don’t see that plan coming to fruition within a year or 2 and I question Nio’s ability to able to scale quickly going forward. 

Solid state battery announcement is great but Nio is adopting someone else’s battery tech with no control on the production pipeline given Nio’s battery partner(s) also partner(s) with other major auto manufacturers. On top of that, solid state battery is not proven to be commercially feasible yet and earliest expected deliveries is Q4, 2022.

I like their directions in self driving by partnering with Nvidia and incorporating LiDAR in self driving. But we probably won’t witness the self driving upgrades until ET7 is released. Again, none of these developments are coming to fruition in the near term. Nvidia also already partnered with other many auto manufacturers like Xpeng and Li for self driving development.

As a holder of 160 shares of Nio, I’m concerned about Nio’s ability to execute long term growth initiatives._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VRYYF - Very Good Food Company purchases "The Cultured Nut" in an expansion to the plant-based Dairy industry I've mentioned this stock a few times on this sub to mixed reviews. I have 750 shares at around $2.74, and the stock currently sits at $7.89 (Canadian prices, and the ticker is VERY on the Canadian Stock Exchange.)

The purchase was for $3 million. $1 million of which was cash. 

They also expanded their production facilities and weekly production amounts by almost tenfold in the past few months, and announced they are opening a restaurant in Vancouver a few weeks ago as well. 

I know this company had some publicity issues with supposedly paying Social Media people to promote them but, I think that negative energy is behind now. They also hired the old Daiya President, who worked in the facility they bought in Richmond, BC now too, so they are familiar.

It's interesting that there are bears who see this company did not grow during the pandemic as they should have.   They have a sell-side advertising platform for connected TV and only saw 12% growth in Q3 but due to the increased use of connected TV during the pandemic they should have grown much more.  But the bulls see that they are in great position for growth as we move from the pandemic and advertisers need to buy more adds.  


They also had a scathing report from Spruce Capital last week that didn't have a lot of specifics- https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spruce-point-capital-management-releases-report-and-strong-sell-research-opinion-on-magnite-inc-nasdaq-mgni-301202858.html.


They spoke at a Needham conference today.  https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210105005134/en/Magnite-to-Present-at-23rd-Annual-Needham-Growth-Conference

Did anyone listen to it and have any perspectives?  It was promising to hear about their opportunities across Hulu/Disney/related properties, how many companies demand their data-driven services as opposed to buying direct advertising suppliers, and how Chrome's move away from third party cookies won't have a huge impact on them (though there could be some wishful thinking there).


It would have been great to hear some specifics about their Q4 performance or outlook for the 2021, but we'll probably have to wait another month for that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
