VOO and VGT_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Major Option Purchases 12/23 - 12-31 In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

# Call Flow

[Call Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/f83491b0-fb16-4481-868d-66f471735f1d)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/2db2616e-dee9-4d7d-9fd9-b06fa35e645b)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Targeted Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the "Targeted Flow" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/ed397f1f-09ef-4c3f-8746-e473ec94fb27)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

I have a question regarding currency exchange rates. I live in Sweden and our currency is called SEK, Swedish crowns. About 70% of my portfolio is stocks (the rest ETF:s) and 100% of those stocks are traded on American markets. 

The current prognosis of the USD/SEK exchange rate is that the Swedish crown is going to strengthen, hence 1 USD = less Swedish crowns. How should one handle this currency risk? For example, I bought MSFT shares a couple of months ago for $202 per share, today they're $216 which implies a 7% increase in value. Over this period the USD/SEK exchange rate went from 8,8 SEK per USD (which is the rate I bought at) to 8,2 SEK per USD, i.e. a 7% decrease. These two movements cancel out, and I'm break even. 

How can one handle changes in currency exchange rates? And how can one minimize the effects on his/her investments, mainly stocks and funds.

I recently did some DD on 3 companies with high potential for an internship application (didn’t get it but whatever). Anyways, I decided to share these with you guys... Enjoy!

Cerence (CRNC)
- Cerence offers cognitive assistance to the automotive industry: creating meaningful and smart interactions among the driver, passenger, and the automobile.
- AI is the future; AI has been enhancing and simplifying every part of human life since its inception. Now, CRNC offers consumers and automobile manufacturers the capability to add AI and voice technology to automobiles. Even though CRNC hit the market in 2019, CRNC has quickly become the market leader in the space. So far, CRNC has displayed great performance, partnering with some of the largest names in the auto industry (BMW and Ford to name a few).
- My biggest concern is the potential for competition. Although CRNC is currently leading the market in its respective field, more established names in AI such as Alphabet and Microsoft may undercut the recently launched company.

Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC)
- Lithium Americas is a resource company that deals in lithium development projects.
- LAC is a resource company that could largely benefit from the imminent electric car boom. Due to its chemical composition, Lithium is the main material used in lithium-ion batteries which are used to power electric vehicles; therefore, the electric car boom will clearly be fueled by lithium much like how gasoline fueled the combustion engine cars for generations. In addition, LAC has the capability to mine, refine, and produce lithium carbonate: owning the entire supply chain.
- My biggest concern is the present and future value of the company’s main two projects: Cauchari-Olaroz and Thacker. As we can not know the current and future value of lithium, we can not realistically predict the overall return of the two projects. This is not even considering the time and cost of labor it will take to actually mine the lithium from the two sites.

AquaBounty (AQB)
- AquaBounty is a company that deals currently in aquaculture services, specializing in the farming of bioengineered Atlantic salmon that can grow to market size faster than what the conventional market offers.
- The appeal in AQB is clear. As global natural salmon production decreases due to environmental constraints put upon by climate change and pollution, aquaculture of salmonids is already used to meet market demands at a competitive price. Bioengineered salmon is reportedly faster to produce and more efficient; therefore, following conventional logic, bioengineering salmon is the logical next step for a competitive market to meet increasing demands.
- My biggest concern is the public perception of GMO foods. As reported by The Hartman Group, consumer perception of GMO foods is increasingly negative year by year. This may pose a potential risk for AQB in the short term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on JETS Looking to buying this with the hope that this year people will start to travel again.

Demand for testing increased significantly during the last few months and some countries like Spain or Canada require a negative Covid test result for arrivals. 

**Market Cap: $241M**

**Expected revenue for 2020: $100M (Financial report), outlook drastically increased compared to previous outlook of $60-65M**

&#x200B;

**ONLY** at Frankfurt airport CNTG has conducted 265k Covid tests during the period of 15.07. and 15.12.2020. Currently they are doing over 3000 tests a day at Frankfurt airport which adds up to over **90k tests a month (worst case scenario). Price per test 59€.** 

&#x200B;

Even though the vaccine rollout has started, testing will be still required throughout 2021 as the Covid case numbers are higher than ever. Also, travel demand is expected to increase drastically this year. Having several testing locations, CNTG will certainly benefit from that and 2021 revenues will be very high again due to increased Covid testing demand.

"With TSLA exiting the year at a 180K run-rate, with output from the Shanghai factory scaling and the Berlin factory coming on line, we are a little surprised that the consensus delivery outlook for 2021 is only 784K units," said JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha.

NYSE Listed. **TL:DR is at the bottom**

Hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.

My  name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.

I’m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I’m  excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet.  I’m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One  of the best investment decisions I’ve made to date came after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.

In  the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock  screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I’ve had as a teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I’ve always found empowering people to be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the  write up.

Another positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word “Smartsheet” mentioned in the video and  said “Are they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said “My  company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.

**The Thesis Statement**

For  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:

*“Smartsheet:  A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of  their teams.”*

I think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet’s website and look at the “About” page, you will  find their “About” statement which says “Smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.”  Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.

In  my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM  software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise  capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let’s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage  work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let’s break them down 1 by 1:

* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn’t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.
* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)
* Wrike is private
* ServiceNow  – CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)
* Asana  is public but just IPO’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don’t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space, they’re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester’s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?
* Monday.com is private
* Microsoft – CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.
* Atlassian  – This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They’re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).

Now  that we’ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution, why is this important?

Well,  let’s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:

“Leaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.”

Key word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:

Asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.

Synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.

Any  communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called “The Power of Done”. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience, and through different research  studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:

“According  to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,  interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.”

They  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.

**How Smartsheet makes money**

At  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.

Before I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.

The idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing?  That’s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.

For  Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.

Smartsheet’s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.

Smartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and  Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.

The  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true “command center”  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You’ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a  few.

I think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as “Smartsheet competitors” actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.

On  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired  10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.

Also,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company’s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.

Nobody  really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out  quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet’s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company’s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company’s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.

As  you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.

Here  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): “I have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need,  when and where we need it,” said Hina Patel, Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. “The ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along  with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” As you can see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.

Lastly, Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:

Subscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue

Professional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue

This  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop  Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth  answer of the question – “Can we 10x from here?”

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So, it's the new year and you want to become a long-term investor A new year gives us a new opportunity to enter the markets after tax loss harvesting comes to an end.  It may also give us an opportunity to reflect on our investing journeys and consider a change in approach.  So... for those interested in making the shift to investing, what does it mean to be a long-term investor?  To me it's about being prepared enough so that I don't have to worry about the day-to-day.

To think of an analogy... It's like the student who studies and does his/her homework the night before and has nothing to worry about the next day.  Sometimes, you did all the work for nothing, especially when the teacher doesn't check your work (think of this as the red day after you making an investment decision).  Sometimes you are rewarded immediately.  However, at the end of the day, the student who does his/her homework every night will have less to worry about when it comes to the final exam.  Similarly, when it comes to long-term investing, by doing your research and coming up with a plan, you don't have to worry or stress out as much about your ultimate success.

Note, that, at the end of the day, long-term investing is just one of many options to get involved in the market.  You can be just as successful, if not more, by day trading or swing trading, etc.  Just know that the path you choose requires a different mindset/approach to the market.  So how does it work?  I wanted to share with you some big themes to keep in mind as you being your long-term investing journey.

1. **Find your WHY.** First and foremost, it's important to figure out who you are and why you are investing.  What is your risk tolerance?  Do you consider yourself to be more aggressive?  How much time do you have?  How do you want to spend your time?  To dig deeper and get a sense of your risk tolerance:  What is your financial outlook?  Do you expect to need money now or expect an uptick in monthly expenses?  Do you have a stable income?  Who do your loved ones turn to when there is an emergency?  What are your investing goals?  When do you want to retire? When do you expect to get married?  When do you want to start a family?  etc.  All these questions, from the day-to-day to the big picture are important to consider when deciding to be a long-term investor.  This should inform how you approach the markets, and what weight you should give certain stocks.  Finding your WHY is an important first step in determining how to approach the markets.  

2. **What are the MACROTRENDS?** When deciding to pick a stock, I like to first think about macrotrends.  Where do you see the world heading?  How do you think consumer behavior will change?  How do you think industries will change?  What impact will politics, international relations, and global and domestic issues have on the economy and the markets?  This requires staying informed about the world to a certain degree, but it's generally a great way to start thinking proactively about the markets and, also, to just become a more well-rounded individual.  

3. **Does the company have a MOAT?**  So you thought of some macrotrends, and you identified an industry you want to invest in.  You pick out a stock.  Ask yourself, does the company have a moat.  A moat is essentially something that allows the company to standout from its competitors.  It can be anything.  It can be the brand name, it can be user experience, it can be expected market share, it can even be the leadership or CEO, or all of the above.  Essentially, does the company have something about it that convinces you that it will stick around, successfully so, 5+ years from now?  As a long-term investor, I always seek to identify moats.  It will take some of the stress out of my decision-making because I am confident that the company will last.  

4. **Are you comfortable with the FINANCIALS?** I don't necessarily find it super helpful to focus in on certain numbers over others, etc.  However, you should have SOME understanding of the company's financials.  For example, I don't think you necessarily have to look for profitability.  Some great companies with solid moats operate at a loss.  Why?  Because they are investing in their growth.  But some companies operate at a loss because, well, they're just losing companies, or the greater industry itself is just falling apart and investors are getting out (i.e. oil).  Or maybe, the company isn't operating efficiently and the company is taking on more debt than it is producing revenue.  Just have a general understanding of why the way things are and how they might be moving forward, that should be enough to get you started.  

5. **Be STINGY:  Is the price right for you?** At the end of the day, you have to make the ultimate, probably most important decision:  is the price right for you?  Understand the basics of the stock market:  essentially, it is a salesperson making a pitch to sell a piece of a company at a certain price.  "Hey, you want to buy a piece of Apple for $130?"  Granted, in real-time you are being approached by hundreds of salesman on any given hour:  "Ok, what about $129?  Oh, lost your chance, now we can only sell it for 134."  When you go to the store looking for a particular product, you already have a price in mind.  Salespeople might come up to you and offer you a wide range of prices for that product, but there is a range that you will consider.  Anything too cheap will make you skeptical of its quality.  Anything too expensive will be considered a rip-off.  Humanizing the market in this way will help you become a steadier investor.  **Is the stock worth X dollar amount to you?** If so, great.  Pull the trigger and invest.  If it goes down the next day, you don't have to worry because based on your research, you believe that the stock will come up and reach whatever dollar amount you think it's worth.  If not, then wait or don't buy it.  There are thousands of companies reaching out to you to buy their company at a certain price--there are always other opportunities.  

6. **Stay informed.**  Once you choose your stocks, you need to stay informed.  This can be a lot of things and it can be done in a lot of ways.  But, at the end of the day, you need some pulse on what you invest in.  Keep in mind the identifying reasons for why you invested in certain things, and be prepared to reconsider or reflect on your choices as soon as those reasons change.  For some companies, it might be easy.  Perhaps the MOAT you identified for one company is the CEO.  Great.  That means, as soon as you see news about leadership changing in that company, you need to reconsider your position in the stock.  You don't have to freak out daily. Macrotrends and moats and financials don't change overnight.  You're really looking for a trend overtime.  A weekly / biweekly / monthly routine can suffice.  

7. **Be as disciplined as possible**.  All of the above factors above ultimately help you to do ONE thing as a long-term investor.  To stay disciplined.  You want to take the emotions out of investing because as a long-term investor your outlook is not next week, next month, or next year.  Your outlook is the next 5 years, the next 10 years, etc.  Don't FOMO into a stock; instead, think about why it's spiking and go through steps 1-5, especially step 5.  Don't sell right away just because the stock you chose dipped 10% based on a piece of bad news; instead, think about why it's dipping and go through steps 1-5.  You get the gist.  As long-term investors we should be thinking big picture.  If steps 1-5 haven't changed after 1 piece of bad news, a 10% dip can be a great buying opportunity.  Alternatively, if steps 1-5 haven't changed after a stock shoots up an insane amount, it may be an opportunity to lock in some profits.

Keeping these points in mind should help you get started as a long-term investor.  Would be happy to chat with anyone about their own journeys or just to discuss!

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. SOMPO’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPO’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I start investing this month? Hi everyone,

I'm looking to start buying some stocks \[Apple, Nvidia, Pinterest, Shopify, Illumina, Enphase, Cloudflare, Atlassian, P&G, etc.\]. Haven't done this before. I was looking to start with 500USD and gradually add up to 5000 this year as I start understanding more about the market.

The biggest worry I have right now is looking at companies like Microsoft who've been around for quite a while. Their stock price is at 222.42 right now. How high can it really go from here? Do you imagine that in 5-10 years the usual share cost would be at 1k or so?

Would you recommend waiting until April or so? The share prices seem to be largely overevaluated.

Also, would it be ok maybe to start with an ETF instead? Thanks a lot!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Return data in general; Why do some stocks have +20,000% return marked for their first day of trading? Hi, I’m currently analyzing some stock data for my thesis, mainly short term returns on NASDAQ IPO’s. I downloaded return data from FactSet, and even though everything else seems normal, I find that about 1% of the IPO’s from the whole data set that I checked had something ridiculous marked as their first day return after their IPO’s, i.e. +20000%, +100000% etc. Anyone know why? 

I’m looking at this from a theoretical POV, but couldn’t find anything from google or even from specific company stock price information. After the first day return however (1-week return, 1-month return etc.) everything seemed more balanced out and the returns were not irrational.

Some sort of explanation for this would be amazing! Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Brookfield Renewable corp 2021 opinion? Hello!

I'm based in the UK, and use Hargreaves Lansdown (an online broker) to invest in a bunch of stocks that interest me.  
Mainly US stocks and funds, but there are some others.  
I currently use Morning Star to track my portfolio, as it tracks everything I throw at it, but don't particularly enjoy the clunky experience or lack of mobile app.  
I like Yahoo Finance, but it doesn't recognise a number of international funds. e.g. [Fidelity Global Technology](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000SX2A)  


[ShareSight](https://www.sharesight.com/uk/) is also excellent and I really liked using it, because it does a lot as well as calculate my tax burdens, but it doesn't track non-UK or non-US domiciled stocks. Meaning anything with an ISIN that doesn't begin UK/US. Like these: [Polar Capital Global Tech](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P00000S6D) and [Matthew China Funds](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000NYUG).  
I've spoken to Sharesight, and they're reviewing adding more domiciles but it doesn't look like it'll happen anytime soon.  


So with that being said, does anyone have any recommendations on a tool/service that can track everything in one place please?  


Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Subs covering Asian stocks Hi there - I am looking to get to know better the stocks trading on major Asian markets (including India) and was wondering if you guys had any particular subs, newsletters and podcasts to start the journey. Huge thanks 🙏 in advance for any tips. Happy 2021 everyone!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Share of 2020 US stock market gains I thought it might be interesting to know whether a US stock portfolio has lagged or come out ahead versus other Americans.

US stock market gained about 6.33 trillion in 2020.

US stock market owned by foreigners = 40%.

Therefore, US stock market owned by Americans = 60%, or gain of 3.8 trillion in 2020.

US adult population = 250million approx.

Therefore, if your portfolio value gained $15k in 2020, you got your fair share of US stock market gains (if split equally among US adults). 

If we're counting by households (128mil), then if your household gained $30k in 2020 from stock market, your household got their share.

In reality, since 10% of households own 80% of stocks, if you're a top 10% household, gaining $237k would be your household share.

If you're not the top 10%, gaining $6.6k would be your household share._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the best 5 year growth stock to buy ? Short but intrigued question, what do you think the best 5 year growth stock is ?

IMO I think Roku and Quibi are a perfect fit - one of the biggest complaints with Quibi was it being mobile-only and expensive, both problems which Roku can solve.

The short-form content will serve as great free content on the Roku Channel while also driving subscriptions to other channels through Roku (the Roku Channel is one of the fastest growing channels but it's primary purpose is to sell content from other providers for recurring revenue).

I think this is definitely a positive for the rapidly growing company and the stock may move up on the expectation that Roku could start dabbling in content creation as it begins to turn revenue-positive._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Jan 04, 2021 These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed posts.

Assuming a decent sized market correction is assumed to arrive in the next year or two, what would be stocks that would crash the most (unrelated to any direct industry news)? In overall corrections are there some stocks that get punished the most and move downward the most violently?

I also would like to combine those with companies with cheap options so I could take advantage of buying "cheap" puts?

No need to comment on the idea that I'm trying to time the market or anything like that. Just a form of hedging I'm flying with.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Crazy to buy AMC right now? Thinking of going long on AMC and just looking for some outside perspectives, so feel free to poke holes. My thoughts are, bottom line, studios need the movie theater revenue stream or tentpole movies/franchises will cease to exist. Also, I don’t think streaming will have a huge impact on theaters in the long run. Streaming is quickly becoming more popular, yes, and subscribers are growing. But theaters hold a lot of leverage, so there will be at least a month of run in the theater for a particular wide release, when things return to normal, before a movie reaches its parent streaming platform. I think the day-and-date stunt Warners/HBO Max pulled will disappear after this year, and maybe even by this summer.

Therefore, with vaccines on target to be widely distributed by April, the first summer blockbusters are back in theaters beginning in May 2021... is bankruptcy for AMC actually likely between now and May?

1. Apple has picked them for their newest 5G phone
The modem, not the processor. Apple's processors are still competitive with Qualcomm's Snapdragons, but it's quite close.

https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/

2. Google Pixels have been using them for years and that likely isn't going to change (at least I think so). They're also in Google's newest 5G phone.

It's possible Google could move to making their own processors to lower costs for their cell phone line, but I don't see them pulling the trigger on it. The market for processors is highly competitive and they're already joining the Video Game market which is much, MUCH bigger.

3. 5G modems will be needed for EV cars. 
EVs function off a computer system to do their self driving thing. They require constant updates with big downloads. 5G will give them a significantly faster download speed and faster GPS functionality.

4. Verizon (the biggest phone company in the US) requires them). Samsung makes their S20 with both Qualcomm and their own, in-house processors as well for this very reason.

Hello all,  I am relatively new to the stock market, so new that I started investing when the pandemic hit. Through my time investing I put my capital into stocks that I could see surviving even if people were locked in their homes. I soon learned that these stocks were doing well not only because of their ability to survive through the pandemic, but that the current administration had been pumping money into the market as a whole. Obviously with power shifting in America to a president elect who seems to be a bit tougher on the stock market and its gains, and with virus cases rising astronomically and many states threatening a shutdown again, the market could see a substantial fall.

**Price Analysis**

* Commodity Channel Index (value>100=entry, value<100=exit): BUY @ 118.32 Steady Flat
* Average Directional Movement (value>20 = strong, value<20 = weak): BUY @ 54.46 Slowly Falling
* Accumulation/Distribution (Decreasing but stock price increasing): SELL
* Aroon Indicator (Aroon Up above Aroon Down): BUY, but potential crossover soon indicating potential trend change (Short term SELL). Potential entry point when Aroon Up crosses Aroon Down.
* Based on the Bollinger Band analysis, the stock is overbought because the price line is very close to the upper band. Also, the upper and lower bands are creating “The Squeeze” situation, indicating that a potential increase in volatility is likely (No time frame given from this indication). Given this indicator, a current stock price of $12.60, and a resistance level of $12.94, it is probable that the stock will drop, allowing for a lower entry point.
