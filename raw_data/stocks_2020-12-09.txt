Is this guy a worthwhile source of info or "just another analyst"? thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Facebook - A Monopoly or A Misunderstanding I know a lot of people have an opposing opinion but I feel very strongly on this and would like to start a discussion. 

I am by no means saying I agree with FB or it‚Äôs ethics and values as a company. However, people seem to misunderstand why FB is the dominant player in social media. It‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what the market decided. There are and have been other platforms, the closest competition of course was MySpace but I would also loosely consider Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and newly embraced Parley, as well as probably lots of other much smaller platforms. Yes FB made some well calculated acquisitions along the way but all large successful company‚Äôs generally do and all their acquisitions went through an approval process. The reason FB is so big is because they had provided the best, most integrated platform, so says the market. 

The other part of this that I truly think many, particularly the older generations, are failing to grasp is exactly what social networking is and that these old laws which much predate company‚Äôs like FB can‚Äôt be properly applied to social networking. The whole point of a social network is to have as many people on the same network as possible so they can all find each other and interact. So naturally a monopoly will form, as most people don‚Äôt want to keep up profiles on many different social media platforms, the vast majority of people just wind up on the biggest and most proven platform. 
This is completely different then say a Oil Company that just aggressively buys up all the competition around it in order to corner the market and have complete control.

Majority of it is in dividend stocks and that's simple enough to understand.. let it ride until you need the cash for some reason. If it goes down, unless something extreme is happening, you just ride it out then too. Even when it's down you'll still benefit from the dividend.

However, I put some money into Tesla and sold just now (made some profit, yay).

Now I'm not sure what to do...

1) I get the mindset for dividend stocks. Let it ride long term growth. ..but what's the mindset for stocks that don't have a dividend?

2) I bought a share of Tesla at $490, and then 2 more shares at $560. I'm not necessarily wanting to leave Tesla for any particular reason. The reason I sold is it's going down today, and all the negative information about it being overvalued, so I figured this was a good time to cash out. When do I buy back in?

3) How do I determine when I should buy back into a stock I cashed out of? If I go back into Tesla at $600, and it continues down, then I end up losing gains after having just made them, which defeats the purpose.

Let's say I buy a 10 puts for a stock for the right to sell at $X for $100. That means if the stocks are still above $X per share at the expiration date, then that means I only lose the $100 that I paid.

However, if I were to sell puts, that is different. Let's say I sell 10 puts for the same stock for $100, that means if the stock do fall below that amount, I could potentially have to pay up to $X per share per put, right? Let's say X was 101, and the stock falls to $1, that means I would lose out on 100 (price difference) \* 10 (number of puts) \* 100 (number of stocks per put), which is $100,000.

BTFD. DCA. DH._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thinking about the Walt Disney Company‚Äôs (NYSE: DIS) future after COVID-19... What will the future offer? The Walt Disney Company‚Äôs time has been quite hard during the last year or so. Coronavirus has massively impacted Disney‚Äôs parks and other experience products such as the cruises. Disney‚Äôs Fiscal 2020 reports show, that the company‚Äôs revenue went down 6%. The studio entertainment also went down a total of -13%, because the film production got completely frozed, since firstly, you can‚Äôt make movies when there‚Äôs an on going pandemic and secondly, nobody is going to the cinema where the money is mainly made in this studio entertainment segment. 

And because of all these things, Disney completely stopped paying its semi-annual dividend. The investors didn‚Äôt get a dividend in July 2020 and they aren‚Äôt getting one in January 2021 either. 

But despite all the big negatives, mainly with the studio and park entertainment, there are still many positives in other areas where Disney operates. Arguably the biggest of them all is the succes of their Direct-to-Consumer & international segment and most importantly, the huge success of Disney+. It had an incredible amount of subscribers, a whopping 73.7 million. In terms of users, the streaming service platform isn‚Äôt quite there with the likes of Amazon Prime Video or the juggernaut Netflix, but it has started to get going really quickly, considering that it has been out for just over a year. 

Disney owns another big streaming service called Hulu, which I think many of us know. Hulu‚Äôs growth has been also rapid during the last fiscal year, getting a huge growth of 28% in terms of subscribers. Hulu has a total of 36.6 million subscribers. ESPN+ has also had a great growth by growing its subscriber amount to 10.3 million from September 2019, when it just had 3.5 million subscribers.

In total, Direct-to-Consumer & International segment had a revenue growth of 81%, netting almost 17 billion in that segment. The segment‚Äôs operating income did go down though because of the costs associated with Disney+. In my opinion that is acceptable, since they aren‚Äôt going to be cold on a year-to-year basis. An operation as big as Disney+ needs something to get it up and running.

The company still managed to get a sum of 12 billion in cash during this hard and difficult year, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. Don‚Äôt see many companies achieving that in a similar position. Take in mind that last year parks were the biggest source of income and they haven‚Äôt done nothing this year because of COVID-19.

On a negative side, their debt also rose substantially from 38 billion to about 53 billion. Again, I think COVID-19 has a lot to do with this, but I wouldn‚Äôt be in total chaos because of this. Once this pandemic is over, I think the debt doesn‚Äôt have to rise that much and they can maybe tackle some of it too, even though they should be growing more importantly.

Ok, so now that we‚Äôve done quite a bit of research what do I think will happen to Disney after the pandemic?

I think Disney is in a very, very good position. They‚Äôve built an awesome source of revenue in Disney+, which will get even bigger through out the years. The amount of versitality that Disney offers in this streaming segment is pretty huge. They have Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Disney can be a really good challenger to Amazon and Netflix if they really want to. It‚Äôll be a hard challenge, but I think they can have a good shot at it, since they are so versitile.

Now when it comes to the other areas of Disney‚Äôs business, it makes the overall picture even better, because they can get to those big billions with the parks and studio entertainment and do what they please with them. Maybe they can even start to pay that dividend again and start to steadily rise that. But I think they should also focus on getting an even bigger market share in the streaming service business. I‚Äôm just hopeful that they can pay their dividend again.

Overall, Disney looks like a really good investment in my humble opinion. The company isn‚Äôt going nowhere. After all, it‚Äôs a big part of American culture and they aren‚Äôt getting outdated either. In terms of dividend, Disney could be a stock like Microsoft and Apple. And by that I mean, having a smaller dividend, but growing it steadily and maybe in 20 years their dividend will be really good. Let‚Äôs hope the future will shine bright on this great company! Great things can happen once the pandemic is over!

tl;dr: A great company with a good future and its push towards streaming service business makes it really attractive. Hopefully they can start paying their dividend again and growing it consistantly.

I have 2 trades I'm considering right now: $1000 into a short term TSLA call, or that same $1000 into THCB.

Obviously if I go TSLA calls I'm looking for a quick turnaround, and while there's a lot of risk involved in something like this normally, TSLA is on such a run right now I'm pretty confident that, at the very least, I won't lose money. 

On the other hand, THCB is looking promising, but would be a longer play. Not even speculation really. The problem I have here is that I can't find any information on the merger with Microvast, other than that it might happen Q1 of next year. I don't really know how much of a gamble this is. 

So I'm looking for advice on which way to go with my money, or if I should look elsewhere altogether. Anyone know the risks involved with THCB?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bubble??

The transaction values UWM at $16.1 billion, surpassing the $11 billion combination of MultiPlan and Churchill Capital III, backed by fellow veteran Michael Klein, announced earlier this year.

* **#1 lender** \- MAT ISHBIA (CEO): Yeah, no, so to be clear, we're the number one wholesale mortgage lender in the country. We've been for six consecutive years. What-- we don't do retail. Quicken is the number one overall, retail and wholesale combined.

AMA question: Good afternoon Ray,
With the fed buying corporate debt, money being pumped into markets, and economic cost of lockdowns, do you believe current equity prices are ‚Äúa house of cards‚Äù with higher inflation coming and what would you advise to hedge? All the best.

Ray's response: I believe that with the enormous amount of debt and money that has been created and will be created in the future, the most important thing to pay attention to is  the value of debt and money relative to the value of assets and other currencies. I described in my book "Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises" which you can get free here, the monetary policy that is going on now, which I call monetary policy 3 (MP3) and which is the central government borrowing a lot of money that the central bank prints to direct it to where they believe it needs to go. I know that this is necessary now and at the same time know that not enough attention is being paid to whether this debt and money is going into things that will produce broad-based productivity gains. As for stocks, they compete with bonds. With bond interest rates where they are, bonds are trading at roughly 75x earnings. With the amount of money out there, and cash being such a bad alternative, there's no good reason that stocks couldn't trade at 50x earnings. You get the idea. Just like you never might have expected bond yields to be at or slightly above 0% (unless you studied history), you might not be comfortable with these kinds of multiples for stocks. However, all investments compete with each other and where would you prefer.

# Looking for advice for getting started with investing

hi, im brand new to investing and looking for some quick tips to get me started. im pretty young and have a few bucks in my bank account that i can use for investing. i can take big risks and i dont't need any money right now so i have good time. it would be great if someone could give me some tips for getting started or witch stocks i should look in to.

thank you so much for the help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RKT and lower mortgage rates RKT saw a big pump to 30 and then a slide back down to the 20's after earnings in September. most of the slide back down was due to RKT having the majority of their revenue from refinancing, and investors worrying about the low margin business, their classification as a tech company (rather than a lending institution) and their ability to compete/innovate. Also, a dependence on interest rates.

There was a post recently about RKT and the way mortgage companies structure to avoid transferring risk from parent to child organizations: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k5jws2/a_point_of_view_on_rkt/

It made me think and gave me pause. I'm in RKT, but not more than 1% of my portfolio. I came across this article today: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/mortgage-rates-set-14th-record-low-of-the-year.html

If interest rates remain historically low, and refinancing is hitting all-time highs, RKT could be a big short term winner of this cycle.

If this trend maintains, RKT could see another pump prior to earnings, but the next earnings aren't planned for release until end of January 2021.

So for any RKT bagholders, you probably have at least 6 more weeks of bagholding before you know whether you're holding forever or get the pump to get off this train.

RKT is currently trading at its IPO price of $20, and I would say anything below $21 is a good entry point. I would exit about 50% of my position around $30 after the next pump, and then ride the next 50% based on macro factors at the time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla, Trading at $650, Gets $90 Price Target From JPMorgan [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-trading-at-650-gets-90-price-target-from-jp-morgan](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-trading-at-650-gets-90-price-target-from-jp-morgan)

$ARCT - Possible trendline holding here, it has a history of bowl shaped reversals. If it breaks the current downtrend line, go long. Very low risk, and this is how I buy runners; nice safe pullbacks. RSI curling, so is the Stoch which cannot get too much lower, so it looks good!   

$BTG - Beautiful channel up, and we are about 1/4th up the current trend line. We are holding life at this support are, which is also coupled with the 50EMA line which is lovely. Go long, if it does not live, you can cut and rebuy in at the trendline up, but this has so much room to run!   

$CHGG - CHGG is holding trendline AGAIN! If it breaks this resistance, go long. It loves to run above all EMA lines and that is where we are at as well. If it breaks this, sheeeesh it'll go crazy.   

$EQT - Bottom channel is holding. If it holds go long and watch the downtrend line and wait for it to break it to really commit full funds. Stoch looks good and so does RSI!   

$JILL - Loves to make massive moves in this golden channel. none are red... all green spikes? Sign me up. Stoch is curling and RSI is fair price. Once it taps into that golden channel, go long and set alerts for when it goes crazy!   

$MUX - Appears to have finally broken the long term downtrend, but is not truly out of the woods yet. IF it breaks this resistance though and goes long, it could be one heck of a ride.   

$RCII - Trying to break this resistance, and seems to be doing it alright. It tested the 50EMA line and now seems to be coming back to do it again. This will eventually break this line and go crazy, maybe it is here or the golden channel - so make sure to see life before fully committing.   

$RDN - Simple, beautiful, 50EMA line in a channel up. It is living here, and at a support as well. So much support I would go long - and just set a stop lose under all this life it has beneath it. Beautiful channel.   

$UFS - This absolute rocket of a channel surprisingly is holding.... well? It is at support in this channel, so it is like a staircase up which I love. Low risk because you can place stop lose under channel and then cut if it doesn't hold, but massive potential here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AirBNB & DoorDash IPOs | CHEWY & GameStop EARNINGS | APPLE news| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-09] **Chewy crushes earnings reports, while GameStop disappoints. What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let‚Äôs talk about this and more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.

[Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories. 

While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.

The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.

Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin. 

Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)

I wouldn‚Äôt touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.

The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.

Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don‚Äôt think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn‚Äôt touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.

In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.

In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.

Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.

While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.

Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.

And finally let‚Äôs talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX. 

On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales. 

So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

Good luck to everyone in the stock market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/q7rHvL5) are mixed while writing this post with the DOW and SP500 gaining ground while the Nasdaq futures are just down for the moment.

BPTRX (I like this one)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ARRY - Array Technologies Alright, listen up clean energy bois.

Array Technologies is a recent IPO solar play with a great fundamental product behind the stock. They provide hardware and software for solar tracking. It's essentially a single rotor rotating an entire row of solar panels on a solar farm, in order to track the sun's movements for optimal energy production. It's not a sexy vaporware technology, but it's damn efficient. Check their website for a more in-detail presentation of their products.

Array is the #2 provider of tracking devices worldwide, but I can see them grow to become the market leader in the next few years. The leader is a subsidiary of solar flow and its exact delivery quantities and revenues can't be determined as they are mixed in with the rest of their financials.

It doesn't take a foreteller to connect the dots for Array's success. As solar energy is growing exponentially globally, the farms that harvest the energy will need to optimize the energy their panels can gather. Array is a well-trusted American company that can help both public and private actors optimize their energy production.

Their growth-rate is in the **TRIPLE**\-digits, and their financials look rather stellar. Again, take a glance at their financial statements for more in-depth analysis. They have no long-term debt and have $27 million in cash. Oh, and the company is profitable despite of its rapid growth rate.

Their stock took a nosedive last week as one of the major stakeholders (hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management) announced they were cashing out. They're selling 25mil. Array shares, and might sell another 20-30mil. shares later. This represents 22.6% of the outstanding shares, so it's not a surprise that the market had a reaction to the announcement. However, this is not adding any new shares or diluting the existing amount of shares, it's literally just a hedge fund cashing out of their early investment. This sale will not result in raising any capital for Array, but it's just literally one shareholder selling their shares.

This dip was not a result of changing fundamentals, company operations news, analyst upgrades or -downgrades, share-dilution, or financial development. One could argue that the dip was entirely unjustified (I'd think it's just a hedge fund cashing out and looking for new opportunities, instead of some fundamental-breaking insider info), but I am for one, grateful for the buying opportunity.

The stock sits at $36,57 as of writing this (under its IPO price). The stock was at 47$ just a few days ago. P/E is 36,63, P/S is 5,07, and the market cap sits at around $4,6 billion USD.

As many of the solar plays have run-up (and for a reason) recently, some to some insane valuations, Array represents a great opportunity for those betting on solar. 

It's still a new stock on the exchange so the stock could go up, down, sideways, or in circles, so I'm not going to give weather forecasts on this. But that being said, I see the stock as heavily undervalued for being a triple-digit growth company in the *green energy revolution* \-space. You could play this as a short-term bounceback with some great gains, or you can play long-term and hope for a multi-bagger. Your move.

 In April 2017, Baidu launched its Apollo project, an open source platform for autonomous driving software.¬†The platform combines a number of tools ‚Äî including data, APIs, and open source code¬†‚Äî that developers can use for free to bring autonomous driving products to market.
In many ways, Apollo resembles Google‚Äôs Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Google‚Äôs open software platform for a mobile operating system (OS) that launched in 2007. The idea for AOSP emerged after Apple released its first iPhone, when Google decided it needed to enter the mobile realm to prevent users from switching to another search engine on their mobile devices.
Rather than launching its own smartphone, Google focused solely on software. The company used an open source platform in part to make it easier for third parties to¬†develop compatible apps. The thought process was, the more third-party apps available, the more appealing phones running on Android software would be for consumers.
This approach helped Google scale Android rapidly.¬†According to Gartner, Android made up 86% of the global mobile market in 2017, up substantially from 0% ten years earlier.

since the start of the pandemic I've really got interested with the stock market for the very first time. I've been buying stocks such as $COTY, $OIS, $CCL and been doing pretty well so far as I've been holding onto them for the rest of the year, since I bought when they were very low.  


I am gonna become 30yo in the next few months, got a stable income of about $1500-2000 that is slowly growing each month. (It's quite a good salary here in Poland, but ofc I do realize it's nothing when it comes to the market and stocks like $TSLA, $AAPL etc.

Thank you in advance for any advice guys._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any opinions on these three Basic Materials stocks? So I bought positions in 3 stocks, CX (Cemex), TECK, and MOS. Heres my thinking:

Theres a huge backlog in building projects due to COVID, in America and around the world. Restrictions are starting to be lifted, and these projects need to be completed. With this in mind I dove into the Basic Materials sector and began looking for undervalued stocks. 

I came upon these three that I liked, looked at the fundamentals (P/E, P/S, EV-Sales, etc.) and came to the conclusion that these stocks are undervalued. I'm new to the forum so this is probably not the way to go about this but here are the numbers:

Last week there were whispers of a rumor that Cisco was in talks to buy Fastly. Yesterday an article from Barron's claimed that an analyst (James Fish who is the VP) from Piper Sandler supports this speculation. How legitimate do you believe this to be and do you think it is positive or negative for the company longer term to be bought out now?

It‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs something. I was going to sit on the money regardless if I don‚Äôt invest it so I figured why not try to at least put it somewhere. I can‚Äôt touch it in the bank anyway so investing came up as an option I‚Äôm exploring. 

I planned on dollar cost averaging my investment so as to not go all in at once. And also to reduce risk of larger losses buying in all at once. 

I‚Äôm not closed off to the idea of investing long term. I would also be curious on thoughts of stocks that might be decent for short term. Ideally I‚Äôd like to have steady investment in something long term like an EFT and some investment that I‚Äôd move around for possible smaller short term gain. I‚Äôd also like to have a small amount of stock in one or two companies I personally like.

So far I‚Äôm only invested in stocks that I have an interest in personally as the amounts are nowhere near what the I‚Äôm about to be dealing with. My current portfolio is only about $100 worth of stocks and only really companies of interest to me at the moment so profit/loss isn‚Äôt a major concern until now. 

I‚Äôm keen to see what people think might be good to look out for leading into the end of the year. I‚Äôm open to any and all advice.

Hi everyone, I'm looking at Bank of New York Mellon Corp, and investing in it, am I missing something ?

Quick presentation : It's a global investment company involved in the management and servicing of financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle. BNY is the largest global custody bank in the world, with about $38.6 trillion in under custody and administration. BNY Mellon‚Äôs asset management division manages over $2.0 trillion in assets.

The revenue growth of the bank doesn't look huge, it's estimated at 2.4 % per year.

Some Numbers :

Price/Earnings : 9.0 Price/Book : 0.9 Price/Sales : 2.3 Price/Cash Flow : 10.7 Dividend Yield % : 3.0 (1.24$), payout ratio : 29.9% EPS : 4.54 $ Return on Equity % : 10.52 Debt/Equity : 0.65

Market cap : 36,1 B

The banking sector has a PE ratio of around 12-13. Bing banks like JPM, BAC have PE ratios of around 15. It's cheaper than  canadian banks.

The business model of BYN seems to have a good moat, it's seems to be a solid investement comparing to the industry. Am I missing somethong here ? If someone can give some insigth, I'm already loading up on it, thinking about buying more.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Option trading question? Still somewhat confused. I may want to behind trading options in the future.

I have a question.

Say I want to buy options for stock A with a strike price of 35, with the current price is stock A at 20.

The call expires in 3 weeks.

If the stock goes over the strike price at any point before the 3 weeks, I can then sell to close the calls at any point correct? The more it goes over the strike price the more the options are worth?

Now if I don‚Äôt have the funds to buy the contracts before I can sell them then what happens? Or once you purchased the call options, selling to close automatically nets you the proceeds?

So in this scenario, I bought 3 call options of stock A(20) for a strike price of 35 to expire in 3 weeks.

My total price would be 300x20? 6k total for 3 call options of Stock A at 20 per share by 100?

Now if the price goes over the strike price in that time period and the higher it goes the more I make? I‚Äôm not capped at just 35 correct?

Now if the price falls below the strike in the 3 weeks, I can either sell for a loss, or let them expire and then I lose 6k? Or do I still own them?

Tesla is just one car manufacturer with technology for autonomous driving, valued at more than all other TOP car manufacturers in the world due to the technology it has. So if you separate car building¬† which others also can do at a bigger scale than Tesla, what Tesla has is the technology for autonomous driving.¬†
Okay you may say Tesla is not just autonomous technology for cars, it is into other sectors as well, then let's look at NIO, valued at $73 Billion for what? Not for building cars at scale or for car sales, but because of the technology it has to offer.¬†

Then look at BlackBerry it also has technology for autonomous driving and is working with ‚ÄúMultiple Auto manufacturers and Tier 1s to develop autonomous driving in Electric cars similar to Tesla and NIO, BUT THAT IS NOT ALL‚Ä¶. It is already in 175M Cars, BlackBerry OS is already being used in 175M cars on the road TODAY, for infotainment and ADAS features, and BlackBerry QNX is enabling these features even on cars powered by GAS while working on Electric cars. If you want more information about BlackBerry WINS check out this link https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=t.bb.db.u&postid=31960017


BlackBerry QNX has autonomous technology and is working with multiple car manufacturers (both Gas and Electric), to enable ADAS features which include Autonomous driving, 5G connectivity, with Safety certifications and with Security which other can‚Äôt match, ¬† but it is not even valued as much as a¬† single car manufacturer at present ( valued at just $3B).
	
	I am fine with Tesla ($573 Billion) and NIO ($73 Billion) getting these valuations, but I want to highlight how undervalued BlackBerry is at $3 Billion.

Air Canada has a virtual monopoly over air travel in Canada. 

The Air Transat deal for flights to and from  the European market is under review and is likely to go through.

Air Canada is heavily supported by The Government of Canada.

Before the pandemic Air Canada was trading above $50.

I was going to use that $3k for a down payment on a car next year but I figured that if I hold these stocks for as long as I can then it‚Äôll a better use of my money. I‚Äôm currently in College and have been working full time while being a full time student so this is all I can contribute so wish me luck! :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Florida oriented REITs? Office space, malls and apartments? I understand that REITs really don't differentiate themselves solely geographically and on the contrary being companies they try to diversify themselves with regards to geography and type of assets.

Still what are some REITs which are more than others focused on Florida?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which upcoming IPO are most likely to invest? There are several interesting IPO's releasing in the next few weeks, so I am wondering which of these IPO's are you most interested in investing?

A) Roblox

B) Wish

C) Airbnb

D) Doordash

E) Instacart_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bull Call Spread Question? So lets use TSLA as an example. Its currently trading at 655.

My questions is why can't I buy a 630 call, then short a 640 call.

If max profit is gained as long as stock is at or above 640, and if I can close my trade anytime before expiration, why can't I close the trade instantaneously, to secure my max profits?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BlackBerry WFH ( Work From Anywhere) BlackBerry $ BB WFH ( Work From Anywhere)

https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/events/security-summit/2020/video-details/modernize-your-network-access-vpns-not-necessary_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have 100k to invest. I'm leaning towards ETF's. What are the best ETFs to invest for 2021? I've had some success with ETFs. They are fairly safe. Always seem to go up. Not gonna get a huge return but 100k invested in ETFs over the next 20 years could be a nice little nest egg.

Considering the state of our economy and world today - What would be the best ETFs to invest in to get a reasonable return every year? I think tech is always gonna be a winner. Possibly healthcare/pharma, because of aging population.

I have done well with SPY. Just recently invested in QQQ. i have 100k sitting in bank that I need to invest. What would you recommend for the highest return without huge risk?  


Im 32 btw and dont need to touch the money for a long time (hopefully)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QS (QuantumScape); Where's the ceiling? This one's been on a tear lately and it's showing no signs of slowing down, but where's the ceiling? QS has grown 350% in month, 30% today and 15% AH. At a $1.6 Billion evaluation it has room to grow but just how far can a battery producer go? Is their technology really revolutionary enough to justify this run?

Edit: Up 25% AH. This is getting ridiculous.
