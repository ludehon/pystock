Small-Cap Value Stocks Hi Everyone,

I’ve been doing some research on what kind of companies to invest in. Ben Felix recommends small-cap value stocks as the stocks that are most likely to perform well over the long term.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Husky was bought out I’m pretty new to the stock game and need a bit of help here, I bought husky energy at 3.75, stock sank to 3.20..

Help pls_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When would you use market capitalisation? I’m new to investing and am trying to get a deeper understanding of all the metrics and ratios used to determine stock values. 

As I understand market capitalisation is the outstanding shares X the current share price, but what exactly does this tell you? Am I right in thinks It’s not more than just the market’s valuation of the company? 

Why would you need to look at this when considering a buy or not?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I'm not worried about a resurgence of inflation **TL/DR**: Despite massive fiscal stimulus packages and seemingly never-ending quantitative easing programs, I don't believe we're headed towards a world of out-of-control inflation. Why? The prospect of permanent economic scarring in certain sectors due to extended lockdowns coupled with rapid technological adoption are two factors that are likely to keep price pressures low.

**Investors seem quite concerned about rising inflation risk**, which is likely supporting the strong bid for inflation-hedging assets like gold and bitcoin year to date. Adding fuel to the fire, top money managers, like Bridgewater and BlackRock, have been vocal in financial media lately about the risk of a high-inflation regime down the road. A high-inflation regime would be a remarkable departure from the past decade, where inflation was relatively tame even despite ultra-low interest rates and the introduction of unconventional monetary policy tools, like quantitative easing (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC](https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC)).

Similar to what was observed over the past cycle, I don't see recent policy action leading to sky-high inflation in the future. 

* First, it's important to note that **fiscal and monetary stimulus is a** ***response*** **to a weak economic outlook**. Direct income assistance (i.e. the CARES Act) is meant to help offset lost wages due to extended lockdowns and business closures. Those who believe inflation is going to materially rise would argue that the government built a "bridge too far" - though so far the pandemic has outlasted the duration of U.S. stimulus measures.
* Second, **the pandemic has supercharged the digital economy**. E-commerce is exploding (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/7GQknX6](https://ibb.co/7GQknX6)) - a long-term trend that I believe is likely here to stay.  It is well studied that e-commerce is a deflationary force (read more here: [https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649)). The intuition is straightforward - the internet increases price transparency, lowers barriers to entry, fuels competition, and increases aggregate supply. More online shopping is likely to keep goods price inflation in check for now. This goes without mentioning innovations in the services sector, such as telehealth and online education, which could also keep inflation at bay.

Lastly, as a professional investor focused on global macro, predicting where the global economy is headed is *hard* and an incredibly humbling exercise. I prefer preparing my own portfolio for a range of outcomes - so while I personally hold *some* gold and bitcoin, I wouldn't bet the farm on a resurgence of inflation in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fastly - what is their Moat?

If there's anything key im missing to this before I buy into some VUN some insight would be great. Thanks in advance!

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any real reason to diversify outside VOO? I will begin with the obligatory "long time lurker, first time poster" intro. 

So, after playing around with stocks for the last few years, I (32M) decided it's time to take my portfolio more seriously and load up on ETFs. 

After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that I should be going for growth-oriented ETFs over dividend ETF, as I am non-US resident and therefore liable for \~30% tax on every distribution, even if DRIP-ed. 

Since this is a long-term play, expense ratio plays a key role, which made me choose Vanguard. 

Initially, I started buying VOO, as the S&P500 is my go-to index. After a few months of dollar-cost-averaging pretty much on a weekly basis, I started thinking about diversification outside the US economy into VTI (world ETF) or a number of other EFTs (emerging markets/China/Europe etc.)

After thinking some more, I decided to compare some major indices around the world to the S&P 500 (DAX, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng). 

The results were much of a surprise, for the last 30 years, the S&P 500 performed better than any one of these 4 indices. DAX and HS showed similar growth since 1990 while FTSE and Nikkei showed much smaller growth. 

The most interesting conclusion I had drawn from this small Sunday morning research is that while every single index showed increased sensitivity to the S&P 500 movements (dot com bubble/housing bubble and Covid), while the US economy did not necessarily respond with the same strength to local events in other markets. 

Which brings me back to the title of this post: is there any real reason to diversify outside VOO? It seems like with other markets I will be exposed to the downside of the S&P but not necessarily to it's upside. 

Is there anything to gain with exposing my portfolio to other markets?

With the given news of covid reaching a second wave in Europe, what implications does this have on the US economy? If tighter restrictions are placed there, wouldn't their production rate decrease?

To my surprise, some of these states have legalized cannabis. When I went to the shops I saw that there is supply for medicinal marijuana and the recreational shops go out of stock fast. This to me, indicates that there is massive demand for recreational marijuana in the area that distribution for these retail shops can not yet match sufficiently. So there's an opportunity for a cannabis distribution logistics company to truly thrive in the future and help meet market demands. 

Now I know there's a craze over investing in cannabis stocks. But I would like to know what you all recommend in terms of these dots that I am seeing. Are there emerging cannabis distribution stocks? ETF I should look into?

“The only thing certain about oil is uncertainty.” - Dr. Subroto, then Secretary-General of OPEC.

After the clean energy post there were some asking about oil/traditional energy. This post will probably be more controversial, but here are still many out there that believe oil/gas will continue to have a future.

So this post will focus only on the energy ETF: XLE. Also, XOP and USO will be briefly discussed at then end. Individual holdings will not be discussed, this will be left up to individual research. **Let it be said upfront - Unless you have very high risk and volatility tolerance this market sector should be avoided!**

For most normal investments it is always important to keep a long-term window on your mind, however in this case, with cleaner energy sources poised to slowly replace traditional energy, it would be wise to be mindful about the potential gradual decline of these ETFs/market sector. With this being said however, oil forecasters (just like market forecasters) have been so wrong so many times in the past 30 years. Whenever it is predicted that oil will do one thing, it does the opposite.

As the world transitions to cleaner resources many countries will continue to lean heavily on oil/natural gas to bridge over. Interestingly, Germany actually increased their consumption of traditional energy sources as they have gradually weaned off their nuclear power plants in their plans to transition to greener sources (What do you guys think about nuclear power as a clean resource?). This bridge period will keep these sources relevant for some years to come.

Additionally there are many other factors than will affect the prices in the future, such as: wars, internal OPEC conflicts, an increased number of drivers in developing nations, an increased need for cheaper energy in developing nations, the use of oil in many products and services still, a rise in air travel (especially after COVID), etc. There are many reasons that oil/coal/natural gas will/won't remain relevant. (If anyone has any additional insight or an interesting note please let us know! I don't want this to be too long here)

Alrighty so...

# XLE: Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund

Let's break down what XLE aims to do and it's holdings. XLE tracks a market-cap-weighted index of the S&P500, because of this it is only composed of US companies. Its primary aim is to provide high liquid exposure to the US giants of the oil and gas industries. The holdings consist of many companies we are all familiar with, examples: Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Conoco, Phillips 66, Valero, and so on. Currently it has 27 holdings.

Top sectors:

* Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing - **59.10%**
* Oil & Gas Exploration and Production - **20.55%**
* Oil & Gas Transportation Services - **10.79%**
* Oil Related Services and Equipment - **9.57%**

Currently numbers for XLE:

* Current Price - $30.54
* 52-Week High - $62.44
* 52-week Low - $22.88

Like everything else, XLE dropped to lows in March, rallied to the mid-40s by mid-summer and has been falling since. However, at this point, the average volume is on a decline, this indicates that the number of sellers might be lower, this could lead to price stabilization around the \~$30 mark. Here is where investors with a high risk tolerance could consider buying in. The assumption (refer to the quote up top) here is that oil and gas demand will pick up next year. According to some estimates the world demand for oil next year will increase, however, a reverse side to this are predictions for second infection wave that slows the economic recovery. Again, if you do not like volatility then do not consider this position.

**A note about the dividend yield:** Yes, XLE does have a high dividend yield at 7%, however, the payout amounts have fluctuated greatly. This is a given considering the fact that oil went negative in April. Due to this ETF's heavy concentration in one particular sector and the given volatility, it might be better to look elsewhere for a stable high dividend yield if that is your interest.

# A Note about the Individual Companies:

The majority of this is being left to individual research. This post would be too long to talk about all the players. A noteworthy mention though is that many of these large oil and gas companies are not blind about the eventual decline of oil and gas (a time window for this decline is obv up to speculation), and many are trying to reinvent themselves or reposition themselves to enter into the green markets (or other markets) to maintain relevance. Just some thought juice.

# A Note about XOP and USO:

XOP is often compared to XLE, please note the difference: XOP provides an equal-weight approach to oil/gas exploration & production. Due to this the fund has higher exposure to the number of small- and midcaps increasing it's volatility. It is also very heavily weighted towards Exploration and Crude. This ETF is more affected by crude oil futures and has been hit partiularly hard due to its small and mid caps not being able to weather COVID and negative oil.

USO is an ETF that is designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate. If you compare the 5 year price of oil to the 5 year price of USO you can see how USO drastically underperforms against its benchmark. Additionally, this ETF deals heavily in futures contracts, which normally isn't an issue unless the price for whatever they bought crashes (Like oil did in April). So in the short term they are hemorrhaging money and then having to reinvest back in at higher prices. The main takeaway from this would be - If you want exposure to Oil/Crude Oil, XLE, XOP, or just energy stocks might be a better option.

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

This post I am sure will be controversial. So again, this cannot be stressed enough, unless you have high risk tolerance or a positive outlook for Oil and Gas, avoid these funds/market sector. If anyone has any constructive arguments for or against oil/gas, please comment! It is always great to hear about everyone's perspective, especially if they are well versed in the particular industry.

Additionally guys, I am just a dude that likes investing, researching, and sharing ETFs and Stocks, I do hold very small positions in XLE just because I believe there may be some positive swings in the future, but that is just my personal opinion. Point is - PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH, especially since I am not an advisor and this is certainly not holistic, there is a lot going on behind the scenes for oil and gas. Subsidies, taxes, regulations and all that weren't even mentioned buy they absolutely have their implications. And, as always thankyou for reading.
