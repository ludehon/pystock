Overall I have been fairly decent at timing the market.  This last time I needed to rebalance, I also needed to take a cash distribution (I am 60).

I know it's hard to time the market, but in my situation what would you do?

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Value Investing Hello,
My question I believe is going to be helpful for a lot of people here. 
*Introduction*
I‚Äôm trying to become an investor from a speculator and in this process I read the good-old Intelligent Investor by Graham. I have been binge watching various videos from the likes of Buffet and Munger. I have a really deep relentless itch to know more now. Summary to my questions: 
1) your favourite value investing resources üìö 
2) Your experiences üôÇüôÅ, your favourite tools-techniques üõ† 
3) Why haven‚Äôt so many value investor gotten really rich üíµ even with the resources üß∞ better than I will ever have? Do I even have a chance?

Expansion to the above questions: 
1) Please suggest me some of your favourite books. I have heard the Security Analysis by Graham (1-6 Ed.) is not worth in today‚Äôs context. If yes, I will use that, please suggest some more on top of that. 

2) 4 parts (a to d) to your experience: 
a. If you have been a value investor, what has been your journey like? 

b. What tips/tricks you have seen to be rewarding. 

c. Curious to what tools and techniques you value investors use because there is only so much one can do, and there is a different tool for everything but then there are all more-or-less the same. 

d. Did you go through Graham‚Äôs analysis of  the stock for 7 yrs, then sector-wise analysis, then economy before you bought a stock. If yes what tools helped you the most and how did this approach turn out for you.

3) I thought the world was full of speculators, but now after being little deeper into this value-investing world I see there are a lot of investment bankers and other savvy-n-smart humans value investing on the daily. Makes me think, they definitely have better tools than me, more focused time and better team(s) at their disposal but then why are they not rich or known. Only few them are worth over a billion‚Äîwhile managing portfolio of a few millions or few billions.
And how difficult and/or easy is it for an amateur like me to confidently pick a value stock before them?

Thanks for making it through this long question but I‚Äôll be really really grateful if you could provide this amateur some guidance üôè üòä ._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying IPOs revisited - some 2020 data Not long ago I posted some results from a study I did of IPOs dating back to 2012 to see whether it made sense to buy IPOs on the IPO day or wait.  I focused on "popular" IPOs to capture the FOMO phenomenon with the highly anticipated IPOs.  The result was clear that it almost always makes sense to wait 6-12 months because in a very high % of cases, the stocks dropped to a price below the opening price at some point, and usually reached the lowest price within the first 6 months.

Now that we're hitting the end of 2020 I decided to look at some of the IPOs from this year.  I went back and recorded every IPO in June through Sept which takes us back 3-6 months.  I then eliminated a bunch of very thinly traded SPACs that have hardly moved since their IPO.  That left me with a sample of 72 IPOs during that time frame.  Here's what I found:

Number of stocks that opened trading at a higher price than the IPO price: 60/72 (83.3%)

Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the opening price: **71/72 (98.6%)**

Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the IPO price: 27/72 (37.5%)

Number of stocks currently trading below the opening trade price: 16/72 (22.2%)

I draw a few interesting conclusions from this data:

1. Like my other studies, this data confirms the "bowl" pattern that is very common with IPOs: the price opens high, subsequently drops to a lower price, and then generally climbs above the opening price.
2. Buying an IPO on the day of the IPO is a huge, huge mistake.  In 98.6% of cases, literally all but one, investors could have gotten a lower price.  In some cases that would have been an intraday low on the IPO day, but in most cases the low came in the days/weeks after the IPO.
3. I don't know if this is a phenomenon particular to 2020 without doing the same analysis for previous years, but the data clearly demonstrates the FOMO that occurs around IPOs.  In 83% of cases the stock opened trading at a price higher than the IPO price, which means public demand pushed the price above the price set by the company.  And notice that although the price dropped below the opening trade price in 98.6% of cases, it only dropped below the IPO price in 37.5% of cases.  This would suggest that the actual IPO price is a much more accurate representation of the value of the stock, and any stock that opens trading much higher than the IPO price should be avoided until it drops._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it too late to get into ARKK?

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull‚Äôs camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn‚Äôt get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn‚Äôt avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November‚Äôs advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it‚Äôs first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn‚Äôt experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don‚Äôt really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

With shares up 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.

Many of Tesla‚Äôs short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

The next potential catalyst comes in early January, when Tesla reports fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery figures. Tesla expects to deliver half a million cars in 2020, a huge milestone for a company that initially struggled to mass-produce its Model 3 and is now building additional factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How many shares does the company have left? I'm still pretty new to investing in individual companies as opposed to mutual funds, so bear with me if this is a nooby question.

I know that all companies will buy and sell their own stock to raise capital or regain market share, but how do I know when a company is selling too many shares and diluting its stock too far?

The drop was for the following reasons:

\- Not moving fast enough

\- Not enough antibodies

\- THE BIGGEST REASON: May not be a 1 shot solution

The facts:

\- Not moving fast enough:

They are literally on the timeline that they outlined 4 months ago in their past video.

\- Not enough Antibodies

The antibodies after 1 shot of Pfe/ biontech was essentially equivalent to the antibody response in ARCT's first shot.

THE MAIN DIFFERENCE:

ARCT's vaccine in 1 shot provided ample antibodies, but also a strong Tcell response. Much better than any other vaccine EVER created.

\- May not be a 1 shot solution:

If you watch this video and actually understand what they're saying. This is ON TRACK to be a 1 shot solution. If ARCT was creating a vaccine like PFE they would not be valued like this. The reason they are valued at what they are is because of the type of mRNA vaccine they creat that is self replicatin and inducing a strong T cell response. Over time it is already, and will continue to show, that this response is effective after 1 shot over time.

Why T Cell is more important than antibody: [https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/)

Who cares;

If you seriously think that the couple of vaccines available now are ample for what the demand is you are strongly mistaken. Vaccine demand is for a surplus of vaccines. A multitude of vaccines are needed b/c not all vaccines work for everyone.

ARCT has the lowest dosage for a vaccine, single shot (yes, still works), cheaper, EASIER TO PRODUCT, EASIER TO STORE, EASIER TO TRANSPORT. *ARCT*\-021 will be lyophilized, or *freeze*\-dried, so it's can be stored at regular refridgirator temperatures.

Every other vaccine requires expensive equipment to keep it the right temperature at FREEZER LEVELS, not REFRIDGIRATOR. This is a huge difference number 1, number 2 the size of the equipment carrying the vaccine makes a huge difference.

PFE has a vaccine that requires 2 doses, stored at freezing temperatures. This is heavier, more expensive, and requires double the shipment / person.

And for everyone waiting for ARK's approval. They haven't sold, last time it dropped they waited 2 days before buying so you have 1 day left. After that ARK buy goes through you've missed the boat.

At the start of the week, I took advantage if the dip and bought back in at an average of $8.50. Life's been pretty good so far.

Is it ARK's involvement that is driving the run?

I started researching this stock after buying into ARKQ and I liked what I saw. ARK continued expanding its positions on dips and I rode the stock to a nice return. I sold to secure profits (a day early it seems as the price peaked the next day above $10) and got back in once the price dropped. NNDM has been objectively KILLING it since ARK got involved. They've also been solidifying supports by having direct offerings every price milestone (last on was $7.50 and was the THIRD direct offering in a month). Personally, I'm not knowledgeable enough to understand why a company would do this. Would it be to raise capital - and if so, for what?

Or...could it be that a Lockheed Martin's Executive Director of Ventures (Chris Moran) joined NNDM's board of directors back in February? 

It isn't new information but about 2 weeks ago, some YouTubers brought attention to this bit of info and connected it with another related bit of info; the FAA has recently approved 3D printed parts for use on aircraft.

One thing I've noticed on every stock related message board, app, subreddit, etc that I've used is novice users posting "what should I buy?" "What's a good investment?" Etc.

Then they get slammed with people pumping stocks that they own. Pitching stocks they're biased in favor of because they own shares. Stocks that are often extremely volatile or risky, companies that are not profitable or don't have a clear path to profitability.

You probably won't see prices under $70 after tomorrow (currently coming off of 4 big red days sitting at $67) so be sure to act quickly if you're interested!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/31/2020 My Plays for 12/31/2020:

&#x200B;

What every line means. I also use RSI, Stoch, Vortex Indicator, 10-50-200EMA Lines. I also trade off of the 180D/4H Chart

&#x200B;

$ENBL: Possible triangle, but certainly a value here. Support, 200EMA, trendline, awesome. RSI and Stoch just curled and Vortex says fair price.

&#x200B;

$ETON: Ascending Triangle and channel play here, right above the POC. RSI is fair, but Stoch is low and so is Vortex which is good. Riding 200EMA lines as well!

&#x200B;

$EYE: Support, channel support, 50EMA all lined up? Gorgeous; and showing Stoch Divergence. RSI fair and Vortex is a fair price too. Great setup.

&#x200B;

$FITB: Great channel up. This is a great value for this type of play. Perfect 50EMA bounce as well. Vortex low and Stoch low with a divergence, love it!

&#x200B;

$KPTI: What a beautiful channel. Showed life todat after I called it yesterday. RSI oversold, Vortex super low, and Stoch just curled, beautiful.

&#x200B;

$RF: Channel up again, beautiful rise up with the 50EMA bounce. Indicators are fair at best, so this isn't AS strong as others, but a great deal.

&#x200B;

$ROK: Triangle play, Stoch is oversold, and Vortex is consolidating. Has big move written all over it.

&#x200B;

$SPLK: Fantastic deal right here. 50EMA and support play. RSI fair, Stoch and Vortex very low, which means we should see a reversal very soon.

&#x200B;

$SPT: Called before, calling again. Right above the 200EMA where it reverses at - with all indicators super low? Looooove it.

&#x200B;

$UMH: Channel up and forming a new one, so we want to get in now. RSI, Stoch and Vortex low which is great. IF it shows life tomorrow, go long for sure.

&#x200B;

$VERI: 50EMA, ascending triangle, and support area -- great play. Stoch is oversold, other 2 are fair value.

&#x200B;

$WMT: Beautiful channel up. If it dies more here, then wait till about $141. But Indicators say it will be reversing soon, but a great channel._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Few Thoughts on JUMIA My buddy was recently in Africa and told me they were JUMIA trucks everywhere.  They are based in 11 Countries (Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ivory coast, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda, Morocco and Kenya).   They operate similar to Amazon.   Just a few thoughts.   These countries have been literally going sideways for years.   I think with advance of Tech, social media and American tech platforms able to infiltrate these economies,  we are going to see an incredible breakout to the upside.  Lots of these countries are ripe for a boost in economy.

I think the political climate was main thing holding these countries back but with advance of social media,  THE PEOPLE have more power in their hands and the rulers are relaxing things a bit due to pressure (Arab spring etc).   Lots of these countries are also investing heavily in Clean energy.  Lots of solar plants etc.   China is also investing heavily.   So in short,  you are going to see exponential growth in next few years.   Jumia has hit the ground running and they are currently leading.   If they play their cards right,  they have opportunity to do something great.

Has anyone been following this company?   Any thoughts ?

Thank you and Happy new year 2021._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I want to put 1000$ into the stock market for 2021. Everyone always says do your research, some people know a lot about investing and then some people say they ‚Äúwished they started years ago‚Äù

Okay.. well I‚Äôm young. I want to learn. I have a share of Apple and a bit of others. 

Is there any books or good sources I can look to before I put a grand in? Should i talk to a broker?

I‚Äôm medium risk I‚Äôd say. Willing to fail to learn. How would you go about putting this money in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AIV Stock Dividend I‚Äôve done some research, and see how their dividend was handled in November. However, I can‚Äôt find information regarding their upcoming dividend payout for January. 

Does anyone know if AIV has no dividend currently? I‚Äôm wondering if leaving the S&P 500 changed their dividend._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My thoughts and Due Diligence on ABCL **Disclaimer:** This is my opinion ‚Äì I would appreciate any feedback or comments so I can improve my due diligence in the future.

**TLDR**: I want to buy ABCL, but in my opinion ABCL is currently overvalued. I had 3 red flags.

1. A competitor (CERT) has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap
2. ABCL has a high valuation with a small amount of revenue
3. ABCL have less customers than Palantir and C3.ai (competitors) and make less money on average per partner

ABCL has a lot of future potential. I wouldn‚Äôt buy position until May 2021 when the lock-up periods expire unless the price goes below $30 / share (which would put it at about an $8B valuation) before then to at least get some skin in the game.

While the company‚Äôs financial performance is good, it‚Äôs current market cap given it‚Äôs revenue when compared to it‚Äôs competitors does not justify the current retail share price.

Bearish short-term, bullish long term.

&#x200B;

**Part 1 -** **Company Description**

*‚ÄúAbCellera Biologics Inc. \[ABCL\] develops antibody discovery platform.* ***Its full-stack, AI-powered drug discovery platform*** *searches and analyzes the database of natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed as drugs.‚Äù*

According to ABCL in their S-1 form, *‚ÄúOver the last eight years, we have developed and assembled technologies that unlock the database of natural antibodies.* ***We are democratizing the industry by providing our partners of all sizes with access to our centralized operating system***\*.‚Äù\* So essentially, they have this huge antibody database and an analytics platform to help get from point A to point B for their partners.

ABCL makes money through partnership agreements with industry leaders who they help solve problems. Partnership agreements can result in revenue in 3 ways:

1. payments for technology access and performance of research
2. downstream payments in the form of clinical and commercial milestones and
3. royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics

Arguably the biggest biotech / pharmaceutical partnership that has been disclosed is that with Eli Lilly and Company to co-develop their COVID-19 vacine. ABCL has partnerships with a handful of companies in the biotech / pharma industry (some of which are left undisclosed on the S-1).

ABCL also receives grants and non-profit funding. Some of these organizations are the Government of Canada ($175.6M over multiple years) , DARPA ($30.6M over 4 years) the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($4.8M over 2 years).

&#x200B;

**Part 2 - Company Performance**

Liquidity is **improving.**

* Working capital is about $93.9M as of Sept. 30, 2020 according to the filed S-1 form. This is substantially better than the $4.8M reported on Dec. 31, 2019.
* Current ratio is 5.7 per September 30, 2020 data in S-1 form
* Receivable Turnovers improved over 2019 levels (even when 2020 grant money and milestone payments are removed from revenue to be conservative), but it is important to note that it is still at about it‚Äôs 2018 level.

Solvency is **improving.**

* Free cashflow has improved significantly
* Debt to total asset ratio was deteriorating between 2019 and the September 30th, 2020 reporting period. Accounts payable and deferred revenue grew but current portion of long-term debt was significantly reduced. I would expect this to improve with the cash raised from the IPO.
* Times interest earned ratio  has improved over the 2019 reporting period but is still below 2018 levels . The improvement is largely seen from the reduction in interest expense that were carried from 2018 to 2019 and the increase in revenue for 2020.

Profitability is **improving**

* Revenue has grown this year. ABCL‚Äôs profit margin is improving. ABCL is currently growth oriented so I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath on them becoming profitable soon.
* Basic EPS from S-1 form shows improvement for this year (so far) over 2019 and 2018.

So the company is performing well and has a great product, but why has the stock been dropping since IPO day?

&#x200B;

**Part 3 - Market Position**

This is where things get interesting. It‚Äôs hard to find a strictly apples-to-apples comparison for ABCL. They are in the biotech field but are more of a data science company (keeping in mind they sell their services and access to their AI-powered drug discovery platform).

**Predictive versus Prescriptive Analytics**

One company that performs a similar service to ABCL is Certara (CERT). CERT provides customers with simulation of virtual drug trials with virtual patients to predict how drugs behave in different people. Reading the 2 company descriptions, we can see a slight difference with their platforms. CERT appears to use a predictive analytics approach where ABCL uses a prescriptive analytics approach.

CERT also rely on a larger customer bases where as ABCL has a small and arguably more focused client base. While both are providing a similar service, CERT has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap (**red flag #1**).

Having said all of the above, to dive deeper we need to compare ABCL against other prescriptive analytic companies. I‚Äôve picked 2: Palantir (PLTR) and C3.ai (ticker is AI, but I‚Äôll continue referring to them as C3.ai to avoid confusion).

**ABCL, PLTR and C3.AI Revenue Per Customer**

At the time of writing this, here are some of the relevant metrics for ABCL, PLTR and C3.ai:

**Prices: (USD/share)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|34.97|34.97|25.30|145.32|

**Market Cap (Billion USD)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10.243|5.349|47.502|13.928|

**TTM Revenue (Thousands USD)**

|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|29,449|232,746|999,940|164,725|

How does ABCL have such a high valuation with such a small amount of revenue (**red flag #2**)?  It seems strange that ABCL could be valued at about 20% of PLTR (or roughly the same value as C3.ai) when it only makes a fraction of the revenue.

**Maybe it‚Äôs related to the number of partners they have (or at least have publicly disclosed)?**

While we can‚Äôt know exactly how many customers each company has, we can try to guess at the revenue per partnership (or at least by looking at the largest ones they‚Äôve disclosed) ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very rough estimate but we‚Äôre just trying to figure out orders of magnitude here.

PLTR in their S-1 form disclosed that their platform is used by 125 customers. For their TTM revenue, that works out to about $8M per partner.

Using the same idea for C3.ai who has publicly advertised 26 partnerships, their revenue is about $6.3M per partner.

ABCL has 26 customers, but with such low revenue, they only make about $1.1M per partner. So, **ABCL have less customers than PLTR and C3.ai, and make less money on average per partner (red flag #3).** Again, this is just to approximate about how much they‚Äôre making per partnership. It‚Äôs not an exact number but it gives us an idea if the price is out to lunch or not (which I think it is).

**So why is the share price so high then?**

I think this is a case of supply and demand. The IPO was hyped up and there‚Äôs still less than 30% float. Lock-up period per S-1 form is 180 days, so don‚Äôt expect any big insiders to sell anytime soon.

The $17.50 price tag wasn‚Äôt for us, just Peter Thiel and the bunch.

**Peter Thiel you say?**

Yes, Peter Thiel. The same one at PLTR. Peter Thiel had a position of about 8.5M shares before the IPO and picked up another 3M on IPO day. He also sits on the Board of Directors for ABCL (since October 2020).

In the S-1 form, ABCL outlined their desire for growth. They have new facilities under development and are scheduled to take occupancy in 2021. **From September 2019 to September 2020, ABCL has grew their workforce by 82%, moving from 98 to 174 full time employees**. Since September 30, 2020 there have been 50 different job postings advertised on ABCL‚Äôs website. They are looking at some serious growth.

What really gets my excited about Peter Thiel on the Board of Directors is that there are a lot of similarities to how ABCL forms it‚Äôs partnerships for access to it‚Äôs platform to PLTR. Who do you call when you have a problem that you can‚Äôt solve but have lots of data? There really is not a better person to have on the Board of Directors for ABCL, especially after having such a big influx of cash to get to the next level as a company.

&#x200B;

**Part 4 - Final Thoughts**

I think there's a lot to be exited about with ABCL. It's a young and innovative company. With it's low revenue levels and high stock price, it's hard to justify picking up stock at it's current valuation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 21 Jan 2022 90 UAL calls Hey Guys,

I picked up some 21 Jan 2022 90 UAL calls at the peak a few weeks back and am curious if I should take the L or hold steady. I paid a premium for these boys at 3.40 and the current value is 1.97. This is way under my stop loss point, and it seems uncertain if the stock will rebound enough to turn this into a profitable trade. Sure there's time on my side, but the stocks already slipped 10% and I'm down 40% on my position. UAL needs to hit 50 by late January to squeeze out a gain, I'm not so sure this will happen w/the presidential transition and the new covid strain.

Buying in at $60 or less is a deal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing on Margin How risky is investing on margin really is? I was looking at margin rate on my brokerage which is 2.5% that's approximately $25 a month on the amount of $10,000. Putting it all in a stock Apple specifically for long term investing and slowly paying it down the margin over time like a loan._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can I buy $AFPW Hi everyone, kinda new too all this and have come across AlumiFuel Power ($AFPW) i really want too invest in these but can‚Äôt find them available on any platform, can anyone help me and my apologies if this is a really dumb question_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can a stock have a price to book value lower than 1? Why would a stock ever have a Price to Book lower than 1?

If the company would go bankrupt you would get exactly the book value, right? so then the book value should never drop below 1 because that is the sure amount of money you would get back if the went bankrupt.

What am I missing here?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tomorrow's Orders I have invested in 10 Stocks for $1828; here's my list. They are qued to buy when the stock market opens tomorrow.

&#x200B;

1.  Antero Midstream Corp (AM). I bought it because it offers a 16% dividend yield at 7.69 a share. I bought 23 Shares.

4. Discover Financial Services (DFS). Generally considered a good buy, estimates give it low short-term potential but good mid and long-term potential. It also has a 2.00% dividend, which I hope to add some income. I bought 2 shares @ $89.30. $178.6 Total.
5. IEC Electronics Corporation (IEC). Yahoo Finance rates it at a fair value with good short and mid-term potential. It has had a decent run and doesn't seem like it will stop. I bought 14 shares at $13.14. $183.96 Total.

I currently have a small account with cibc investors edge and want to grow my account. I wanted to sell put options to do this and looked at a contract with a strike price of ~ $30. If I was assigned then I would be liable for $3000. First part that sucked is that I had to call them to submit a naked put and could not do it online. Then they said that I couldn‚Äôt complete the trade without $25,000 in the account. 

Why do I need so much in the account if my risk is only 3K. Does anyone have advice on my options or am I SOL until I have $25000 in the account? Thanks for any insight_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
