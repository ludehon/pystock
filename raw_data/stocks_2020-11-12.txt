$HTH Question I've recently found a small-cap stock that satisfies all my criteria in Hilltop Holdings ($HTH)

According to their recent quarterly filing they have almost $24 in cash per share. Am I calculating this incorrectly, because that is currently less than then the market value of the stock.

Regardless, I'm happy to have found this company and would be interested in others perspectives._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Full-time traders. Hello, does anyone here is a “full-time” trader or that trading it’s their main source of income?

I’ve been doing pretty good the last couple of years trading, doing pretty consistent money over the last probably 2 years. I’ve recently had the realization that most months I probably earn more money trading than working at my job. 

So I just had the curiosity if anyone here does only trading for a living and if you have any stories/advices. 

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir stock drops even after company reports 52% sales growth in first earnings statement * **The software and analytics company went public in September, 17 years after it was co-founded by Peter Thiel, CEO Alex Karp and others.**
* **The stock dropped in extended trading. As of the close, it was up 46% from its debut.**
* **Palantir said that its “customer concentration is decreasing,” and that it now gets a smaller percentage of revenue from its top clients.**

[Palantir](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=PLTR&amp;qsearchterm=palantir), the maker of software and analytics tools for the defense industry and large corporations, [reported](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) 52% revenue growth in its first earnings announcement since going public in September.

The stock fell more than 3% in extended trading after plunging 8.7% during the regular trading day.

Here are the key numbers:

* **Earnings:** Loss of 94 cents per share vs loss of 24 cents a year earlier.
* **Revenue:** $289.4 million vs $279.4 million expected, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv.

For the third quarter, the company reported an operating loss of $847.8 million due to an $847 charge for stock-based compensation.

Palantir raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.07 billion and $1.072 billion, which would represent 44% growth from a year earlier. The company previously said sales for the year would reach $1.06 billion. Adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be between $130 million and $136 million.

Co-founded in 2003 by tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, CEO Alex Karp and others, Palantir provides data analytics software and services to government agencies, including the Defense Department, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the intelligence community. It also sells to companies like aircraft manufacturer [Airbus](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AIR-FR) and energy producer [BP](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BP.-GB).

Palantir’s stock opened at $10 in its [direct listing](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/palantir-goes-public-pltr-starts-trading-on-the-nyse.html) on Sept. 30, and has since climbed 46% to close at $14.58 on Thursday. Investors are paying close attention to the company’s customer base, which was limited to [125 in the first half of 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/palantir-says-it-expects-42percent-revenue-growth-this-year-to-1point06-billion.html). As the company focuses more on software and less on services, it’s trying to make it easier for clients to start using the product so it can expand its reach and bring down sales costs.

“Our customer concentration is decreasing,” the company said in the release. Palantir said that 61% of its revenue for the first nine months of the year came from its top 20 customers, down from 68% over the same stretch in 2019. The company didn’t provided an updated customer count.

The company also said that new contracts in third quarter included a $91 million deal with the U.S. Army, a $36 million contract with the National Institutes of Health $36 million and a $300 million renewal with an aerospace customer.

Palantir didn’t break out third-quarter revenue by its commercial and government segments, another key detail for investors. In the first half of the year, 54% of revenue came from government clients, with the rest coming from commercial customers.

I know over time this will go up, but perhaps I’m greedy but I don’t think I’m gonna make a whole lot profit from these in the next 12months. 

So I’m thinking of moving them into more medium risk investments. I’m a big fan of DKNG and think that’ll grow a decent amount, maybe double, shouldn’t lose money long term hopefully - then again I’m not expert! 

Anyway, wondering people’s thoughts on med level risk Stocks I should look into which they are fans of and think will turn a healthy profit 

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on FSR? Hi all, 

I’m currently sitting on 150 shares of FSR and not sure what to make of it. Right now, it seems like Fisker is getting a boost from the NIO and EV hype, and I don’t think it’s sustainable. FSR doesn’t plan to start production until the end of 2022. 

On the other hand, I like the Fisker’s business plan. He plans on partnering with a manufacturer (magna international) and to have an online only sales model to bypass having to build a factory/dealerships. His first EV model already has about 9000 paid deposits, which at the base price of $38,000 equates to $342 million in revenue. He expects to be profitable as early as 2023. The stock has received a price target of $22 and currently sits at around $15. 

What do you guys think? I’m willing to hold a few years but have some doubts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When to take profits? I recently began investing and made around 1400$ profit in roughly 3 months with only roughly 3000$ capital. I feel like I am lucky and should just take my profit now and wait for the next downturn in a few months if I had to guess. If we don't have a downturn I will be fine with the fomo.

If it matters I am only 20 and working on my bachelor's degree at the moment. My college is paid for so this money if I did take it out would just be sitting in my savings until I felt ready to invest again. I am pretty new to this and don't want to push my luck. If I were at a casino now is when I would walk away. I guess that's how I am viewing it and why I feel like I should be walking away at this point._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC Entertainment Stock 2021 I know that AMC Theaters is extremely risky right now, and there's a lot of things that need to go right in order for them to avoid bankruptcy, but if they're able to weather the storm, wouldn't the theater industry be in a much better place come 2021? 

I guess my logic is that, all of the movies that were delayed in 2020 now are going to release in 2021, on top of all the movies originally slated to release in 2021. So the amount of tent pole movies have now doubled for them next year. 

To me, it seems like a unique advantage that only the theater industry has when it comes to these recovery stocks. Someone that has to reschedule a vacation in 2020 won't then book two vacations in 2021. But people who want to see Black Widow, will see it 2021 as well as another movie like Suicide Squad. 

Idk, I could be looking into things too much. And they pretty much need Wonder Woman 1984 to keep its Christmas release date, but just something I thought was interesting and unique to theaters. AMC stock ran up to about $7 when Tenet released, so it seems like the idea of a bunch of huge block busters coming out in 2021 would drive the stock up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Disney loses 36cents per share but beats expectations  “Even with the disruption caused by COVID-19, we’ve been able to effectively manage our businesses while also taking bold, deliberate steps to position our company for greater long-term growth,” said Bob Chapek, Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. “The real bright spot has been our direct-to-consumer business, which is key to the future of our company, and on this anniversary of the launch of Disney+ we’re pleased to report that, as of the end of the fourth quarter, the service had more than 73 million paid subscribers – far surpassing our expectations in just its first year.”

Here are the financial statements: [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HYCzVWZ)

**Management Commentary**

*Overview*

Our growth and momentum across the business have continued.

We generated $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 52% from the third quarter of 2019, when we generated $190.5 million in revenue.

The demand for our software has increased steadily over the past year in the face of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad.

We are increasing our guidance for our full-year revenue in 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, which would represent a growth rate of 44% over the prior year, when we generated $743 million in revenue.

*Financial Results*

Our operating results have continued to show significant improvement.

In the third quarter of 2020, we generated revenue of $289.4 million, up 52% year-over-year, which is approximately $9 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.

We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

Our income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.

The demand for our software from customers in both the commercial and government sectors has continued to increase this year.

In the three months ended September 30, 2020, we closed fifteen deals with new and existing customers, each worth $5 million or more in total contract value, including contracts with the U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health, as well as a contract renewal with one of the world’s largest aerospace companies worth $300 million in total contract value over five years.

The average revenue generated per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up from $4.2 million per customer, or 38%, from the same period the year before.

Our customer concentration is decreasing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from our top twenty customers constituted 61% of our total revenue for the period, down from 68% in the first nine months of 2019.

We continue to have significant cash reserves. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.

*Government*

The U.S. government sector remains a primary area of focus for our business.

Our work with healthcare organizations across the federal government has accelerated this year, and we continue to expand our reach with the nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.

In September 2020, we were selected among 999 bids for a two-year, $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to provide artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for military planning and defense operations.

Our work with partners across the U.S. federal government in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has increased significantly in recent months.

We were selected in September 2020 by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a federal research organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operating under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), for a $36 million contract to provide our software to the agency for cancer and coronavirus research.

Our software is now being used for coronavirus response and research efforts by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a program run under the NIH that maintains the largest clinical data asset in the world regarding the development of the coronavirus. As part of the research effort, our software was used to integrate clinical data from more than one million patients in the United States in a matter of weeks.

The company’s efforts to assist foreign governments in their response to the coronavirus continues in countries around the world.

In the United Kingdom, for example, our software has been used by the National Health Service to allocate and distribute more than 2.7 billion items of personal protective equipment across the country.

*Commercial*

We are continuing to see significant momentum in our business across the commercial sector this year, both in the United States and abroad.

In September 2020, we closed a five-year contract renewal with a customer in the aerospace industry that is worth $300 million in total contract value, representing our largest ever contract in the commercial sector.

The lead time for customers to begin using our software has fallen sharply this year, and organizations continue to expand access to our platforms to users across their operations.

An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.

The energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company’s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform.

Our software has also been used widely by customers across industries, including the automotive, manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, and banking sectors, to adjust their operations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

A major consumer goods company in the United States recently turned to Palantir after an investment of more than one hundred million dollars in another enterprise software platform failed to produce results.

The customer began using our software within days to help address disruptions to its supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The company has since expanded its use of the platform to identify cost savings in raw material purchases across its business.

*International Expansion*

Our expansion in a number of markets abroad continues, including in Japan.

In June 2020, we selected Sompo Holdings, Inc., the Tokyo-based insurance company and Japan’s leading nursing care provider, as our strategic partner. The company is currently one of our most significant shareholders, following its approximately $500 million investment in Palantir this year.

“Sompo’s work is vital to Japan’s welfare and security, and Kengo Sakurada, the company’s group chief executive officer, has been a critical and trusted partner as we work with Sompo to expand our reach in Asia,” said Alexander C. Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc.

We believe that our market opportunity in Japan and the broader region will be significant over the long term.

Our expansion in Asia builds on our already significant presence outside North America, including in Europe, the Middle East, and increasingly South America.

*Financial Outlook*

We are increasing our revenue guidance for this year and now expect the business to generate a total of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion in annual revenue in 2020, up 44% year-over-year.

Our annual adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be $130 million to $136 million, which excludes stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to our direct listing.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue of $299 million to $301 million, up 30% to 31% from last year, when we generated $229 million in revenue.

Our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to be $44 million to $50 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.

We continue to expect that year-over-year revenue growth in 2021 will be greater than 30%.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing.

We believe this non-GAAP financial measure helps us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir’s business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude expenses primarily related to the direct listing, as they are a one-time nonrecurring charge and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of the control of the Company. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Further, this metric has certain limitations, as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

A reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as stock-based compensation, and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to make a move on Li?

Might be time to make a move now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I did it, I cashed out **edit: I guess I should have prefaced this by saying I also have a retirement account that I don’t touch and continually add to. So don’t worry guys I’m not all cash now**

**Edit 2: okay I get it “presumed win” has triggered many of you. Assuming Biden will be our president, we surely can expect a second lockdown is soon to be our reality, and with it, a huge sell off in the market**

Well ladies and gents, I dumped about 40% of my life savings into the market when everything hit the fan in March. I chose lots of risky investments in the hospitality and travel industries because that’s what I know, and I knew who would survive the shutdown. 

I also dove into options trading for a short while during lockdown. I ended up losing 20% of my portfolio to options (options are not my jam apparently lol) , and then I gained 70% profit with my stocks. 

This week I officially cashed out all of my portfolio for an overall 55% gain in 7 months. Definitely happy with that but it would have been more if I never played the option gamble. 

I thought i would hold on to these investments longer... but with lingering talks about another shutdown and with covid cases skyrocketing, I foresee the market taking a huge hit again, especially if Biden holds on to his presumed win. 

So here I am, waiting to see what’s going to happen with covid, the election, and the beginning of 2021.

The huge boost from vaccine news was enough for me to say screw it and sell mostly everything. It’s not everyday that your entire portfolio jumps 30% in one morning. 

Happy with that decision but now I’m lurking to make my next investment plan when the economy figures itself out over the next couple of months.

Anyone else cash out this week?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Going to get some $JNJ, $PEP an $PG to the safer side of my stock investments. Good or nah? They’ll be the stocks that I am choosing for the long term (+10yrs if everything goes well) pick, since they offer good dividend. Every company is #1 or at least competing for that spot, which make them a pretty safe stock.Also, they pay a good and a steady dividend.  

 $JNJ are good since the population is getting older an people need medicine no matter what. Everyone is also going to probably eat Doritos and drink Pepsi, Mtn. Dew and such. I’m choosing them over Coca Cola company, because they have more room to grow and I feel their brand line-up might be stronger than $KO’s.   

People will also use the multiple brands that $PG have like Gillette. They’ll also take care of their hair with Head & Shoulders shampoo. Babies need diapers and it’s a good thing Procter & Gamble owns Pampers.  

As you see, I’ve looked in to these companies and know what they do. I’m also comfortable with them and (I’m hoping) won’t be starting to panic IF something bad would happen in the SHORT term. I’m not sure if I’ll be looking that much in timing the buys (a bit of course), since I’m getting them for the long haul and I sincerely believe, that these companies will grow to even bigger and bigger empires as the time goes. If not, then I’ll be cutting my losses and moving on to other stocks. 

Since I’m fairly young, these companies CANNOT have too big of an equity of my portfolio. Their percentage will grow later as I get older. Most of my portfolio will include Apple, Microsoft, since I consider myself as a tech guy who know thing or a two about the companies. Of course, to maximize growth of my portfolio, I’ll be getting growth stocks, which need more research.

Please let me know if there are more of these kind of stocks like the ones I’ve mentioned up above. Been looking at 3M, but have to read more in to their competitors and such. I’m quite new, so please give feedback._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trump administration readies crackdown on U.S. investments in Chinese firms [https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-china-securities-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-readies-crackdown-on-us-investments-in-chinese-firms-sources-idUKKBN27S2X1](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-china-securities-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-readies-crackdown-on-us-investments-in-chinese-firms-sources-idUKKBN27S2X1)

* US equities mostly lower in Thursday midday trading after putting in a mixed performance in prior session. Value underperforming growth for a second straight session following big pro-cyclical rotation early in the week. Financials, energy, materials among the worst performers. Comm services, tech, healthcare outperforming. Treasuries stronger with the curve bull flattening. Dollar weaker vs yen and euro but firmer vs sterling. Gold up 0.9%. WTI up 0.7%.
* **No big directional drives in play thus far today**. Path of least resistance has recently been higher on vaccine optimism, removal of election overhang, continued monetary policy tailwind and earnings resilience. Key areas of concern revolve around worsening coronavirus trends and the potential for a scaled-down stimulus package. Much of the focus over the last few days has been on what is going on below the surface in terms of a rotation from growth and momentum to value and cyclicals. A number of strategists have said rotation has more room to run but some have questioned sustainability, highlighting lack of traction behind prior moves.
* **Resurgent coronavirus cases, an increase in hospitalizations and new restrictions continue to dominate the headlines**. However, new wave may be cresting in European hot spots. Vaccine optimism still elevated with MRNA-US completing case accrual for interim analysis. **Politics the other big story** **though market implications limited for now**. Trump campaign trying to block certification of Biden victory in key states but reports noted the futility of these legal challenges. Biden named longtime advisor Ron Klain as chief of staff, as widely expected. Also reassured allies on regional security in calls with leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia.

I’m looking more for speculative long term prospects to investigate but any chatter would be appreciated.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DoorDash, Roblox, Wish and Airbnb all expected to go public before year’s end, sources say Some of the hottest private consumer tech companies are rushing to file their IPO prospectuses so they can go public before the end of the year.

Airbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.

It’s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.

Between early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.

Filings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.

All four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.

Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.

Despite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.

The sector’s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

I'll give my thoughts here, and then hopefully some people can come back with some refutations and differences of opinion - as I'd like to get a better understanding of the counterarguments.

&#x200B;

As far as I can understand it, the traditional method of dealing with recessions in the past was to decrease interest rates. This allows for cheaper borrowing by companies, who can then invest the money they borrow into the production of future growth. This should then increase the size of the economy overall, resulting in a net creation of wealth. The negative effect of low interest rates is that it makes capital allocation less efficient. This is because companies need to produce a smaller amount of growth from the borrowed money in order to pay it back - encouraging less efficient companies to take out loans. This has resulted in 'zombie companies', whose profits can barely cover the tiny amount of interest required to service their debt. If interest rates were to rise even a small amount, these companies would quickly be unable to service their debt obligations and would face defaulting and bankruptcy.

&#x200B;

I believe the ideal approach is to lower interest rates when times are hard - to encourage borrowing, but then to gradually raise them as the economy improves, in order to improve the efficiency of capital allocation, and to provide a buffer for reducing interest rates in the future. However, this has not been the strategy used in the past, and central banks have struggled to raise interest rates to previous levels after each successive crash without causing disruption to the markets and economy.

&#x200B;

In 2008, during the global financial crisis, the rates were already relatively low before the crisis began. This meant that lowering the rates to zero was not enough to provide the required liquidity to the market, so an alternative approach had to be undertaken. This is known as Quantitative Easing (QE), and - to my understanding - is the purchase of government and corporate bonds by the central bank. The purpose of QE is to inject liquidity into the market while locking up assets in a way that the created money does not flow into the economy and cause high inflation - as would be the case if money was simply printed.

&#x200B;

Again, I believe that the goal with QE is to provide short-term liquidity to the economy when times are bad, which is gradually rolled back as the economy improves, resulting in the selling of these assets into the market. Again, to my knowledge, this has not been accomplished effectively since 2008, resulting in a climate of low interest rates, and high levels of risky corporate debt held by central banks.

&#x200B;

Now, we get to the COVID crisis, whereby the economy shrinks rapidly in response to lockdowns, lack of travel etc. The market takes a deep nosedive off this news, as companies begin to draw on credit lines to carry them through the downturn - resulting in a loss of liquidity. Central banks respond to this by cutting rates to zero. As the interest rates were still extremely low before the crash, this did not provide the required liquidity - so a huge amount of quantitative easing was required - over double that which was introduced during the 2008 crisis.

&#x200B;

The rates being so low encourages spending rather than saving. However, in the COVID economy, there is nothing to really spend money on - there is no point in investing in productivity or future growth as sales and revenue are expected to be lower, not higher. The supply of bonds is also low, due to the huge amount of quantitative easing. This means that there is no place left for this additional liquidity to go - other than the stock market, further inflating a huge asset bubble. This is caused by the influx of retail investors into the market, stock buybacks by corporations, and financial firms having no other place to invest their money for a decent return.

&#x200B;

I believe there are several key risks for the near future.

1. The extremely high level of bad corporate debt and the high number of zombie corporations means that a tiny hike in interest rates would cause a huge downturn in the stock market and would mean many companies face bankruptcy.
2. Any reduction in the stimulus provided by central banks would cause a credit crunch as companies try to draw on huge amounts of cheap credit.
3. A reduction in QE would mean there are no buyers for junk corporate bonds, meaning that companies cannot refinance their debt and will face default and bankruptcy.

&#x200B;

Does anyone see a way this can all return to more sensible levels without a huge bubble popping? And is there anywhere in my post where I'm way off the mark? As I say, I'm not an expert on this at all.

&#x200B;

Hey everyone and Welcome to my channel, so let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday As the Nasdaq bounced back with a jump of 2% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/DVfGGSL)  while the S&P followed the lead and rose 0,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/LzJNVLQ) while the Dow finally took a breather and was barely down for the day [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/K9pPfJ2). The volatility index continued to drop past that level of 25 for the first time since the last 2 months [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/CV3JBkG). Yesterday we saw pretty much an even market as the advancing to declining stocks were even while 78 made new high and just 12 made new lows. The volume finally slowed down a little after the huge first 2 days of trading this week due to the Pfizer vaccine news [ADVANCING](https://ibb.co/VCdkLBK).

We have to be vey aware of the stock market as investors have made a huge sentiment shift as we saw a jump of 18% in bullish investors and a decline of almost 7% in bearish as we are way above historical averages [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/CtZfLPP). This usually is a bad contrarian indicator for the market as the time to invest is usually when other people are scared or afraid to put money in the stock market. We could potentially see a correction of the stock market especially with cases rising of Covid-19 and with the number of deaths trailing this by about a month, we could see huge numbers that could scare investors in the next month or so. Add to this the volatility that is expected to arrive around the Georgia runoff election this is a serios thing to consider. It may be better to wait for the next correction to put money into the stock market. Here is a chart of the SP500 and the VIX being inversely corelated as you can see whenever he vix sees a spike the sp goes down but with every even that caused volatility the market has recovered and has made new highs after that.

Before this next point I have to tell you that I have no partisan view as I am not a resident or citizen of the US. So though already announced by many as the next President, Biden win % as dropped slightly after the first days of the election results this probably is due to the fact that Trump is not willing to concede and continues with his legal ballots [BIDEN %](https://ibb.co/ZTvYnZL), so I don’t think this will lead to anything and expect Biden to take-over in January but the more important thing for the stock market investors is that big changes are very unlikely as the Senate has a more than 80% chance of being controlled by the Republicans [SENATE RACE](https://ibb.co/99KXKyN) which will likely deny any chances for the Democrats to raise any taxes or to do any radical left ideas. So, this bolds very well as the stock market loves the most that things don’t change to often and it also loves to not have unknowns.

So, Moderna also has announced that they will soon publish the vaccine study for they’re candidate [MODERNA NEWS](https://ibb.co/SKxWZCn), if we do see great results in this vaccine I believe the market will react very good to the news, as every new vaccine can take us higher as a whole market especially led by the SP and the Dow Jones. As there has been some doubt to the Pfizer vaccine as the CEO sold more than 5 million $ worth of stock on the same day they made the announcement even if it was a scheduled sale this has made people have some doubts about the results [CEO SALE](https://ibb.co/d5Lvsnq). So as you can see the next results that we are expecting for vaccines candidates are from Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J and Novavax. I believe the next 3 will be pretty important for a better market outlook. [NEXT VACCINES](https://ibb.co/LQ9nCV1)

Also, other good news came from the UK as they save a growth of more than 15% in the 3rd quarter, though the economy is still down more than 8% from before the pandemic this seems to be a good recovery track that has been unfortunately derailed a little probably with the latest lockdown in the UK.

But the more important aspect to watch I believe is how well or bad Disney+ is doing, if they deliver another great round of subscriber growth this will be a huge positive for the company which has seen it’s parks revenue plunge with the pandemic this year with lots of jobs being cut that did eventually help with lowering the costs for the company.

Simple XPEV makes affordable EVs that appears to the middle and lower class which is huge considering the population of China and eventually Europe. Not many people can afford to spend over $60,000 on a vehicle but people will be willing to spend $25,000-$30,000 on a vehicle especially if they do not have to spend money on gas too. The gas prices in countries other than America are outrageous over $2 per liter in many places. The appeal of an affordable electric vehicle is undeniable. I know everyone is talking about EVs but there is a reason why, it is the future. XPEV also released outstanding financials and will continue to grow as they are the only big company producing affordable EVs.

Sony has made launch sales online only to maintain social distancing, calling for consumers to "be safe, stay home, and place your order online".

The next-generation console, which retails for $500 or $400 without a disk-drive, was sold out on major retailing sites in Japan with some conducting lotteries to distribute limited stock.

On Japan's top flea market platform from Mercari Inc, consoles were selling for more than $900.

Pent-up demand for the PS5, which offers cutting-edge graphics, faster load times and a new controller with immersive feedback, has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which has seen consumers flock to gaming but has strained supply chains.

Analysts see shortages of consoles from Sony and rival Microsoft Corp, which launched Xbox devices on Tuesday, extending into 2021.

This image shows the big array of tax lot stock disposal methods m broker offers. 

As explained in [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/taxlots.asp) , the default tax lot stock disposal method is almost always FIFO (first in first out). However, the article gives me the impression that from the tax perspective, selling the highest cost basis lot first should always results in lower taxes. That would be the "High Cost" method in the above table.

Average volume: 41 million

Volume today: 47 million

Sell Volume-
Including pre and post hours trading, there was never a sell volume over 1 million, and this threshold was only hit one time at the 9:40am-9:50am block. Palantir shares never saw the 2 million mark, and sold off at the volumes of ~750k and ~650k during the blocks of 1:40-1:50 and 3:40-3:50 respectively.

Buy Volume-
During the same trading day, including pre and post hours, the buy volume heavily outweighed its counterpart. Palantir reached a buy volume of 2 million during open from 9:30am-9:40am. PLTR also reached a volume of 1 million twice. During both the 10am-10:10am & 1:30-1:40 blocks. ~800k was reached twice as well, during the 12:30-12:40 and the 3:30-3:40 time frames.

Conclusion: Buy the fuck out of this before it's doing NIO numbers.

From my admittedly layman perspective ([https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/](https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/)), there are 2 takeaways:

1. Google feels comfortable with their machine learning program so that they no longer need so much raw data. Sign that perhaps they can be a leader in certain technologies moving forward, especially with all of their projects that this can potentially synergize with. 
2. Pixel devices retain unlimited storage, showing that Google is willing to fight for hardware presence which can then lead into Apple's pivot into ecosystem recurring revenue. While Android is not as tight a ship as iOS, it is arguably a way to leverage existing positions in their many services and hardware projects. 

Seems like positive news for Google moving forward, but perhaps it's only for cutting costs. Would love to hear your thoughts!

1. There must be demand for the company’s products. Nike’s been creating demand for decades, thanks to the “cool factor” supported by sharp advertising and clothing that looks good, feels comfortable and lets everyone know you’re an athlete. 

2. The company’s total addressable market. In other words, how big the market is for its products. Cramer also likes to know where it sits in the pecking order. Nike is the dominant player in footwear and number two in apparel. 

3. Are there any catalysts that can power the stock higher? Nike has several catalysts, like the Summer Olympics. 

4. Other ways to look into the future. Nike has a company-specific key metric called future orders, which allows customers to order merchandise six months ahead.

5. The company’s ability to pass costs onto the customers. Nike made it clear in the conference call that it had no trouble passing on raw costs through price increases, Cramer said. 

6. It’s important to understand the geographic breakdown of the business. Nike’s fastest growing geographies are emerging markets, which is up 26 percent year-over-year. China is up 28 percent and the U.S. is up 21 percent. Western Europe and Japan are still challenging environments, but they’re offset by the strength elsewhere.

7. Wall Street loves accelerating revenue growth. Nike has this across multiple product categories in both developed and developing markets.

8. Inventory. When companies with retail components have too much inventory, it can be a problem since they’ll have to discount the older products before bringing in a new product. Nike’s unit inventory growth outpaced its sales growth, but since absolute unit levels have "plateaued," Cramer is not concerned. 

9. Good companies are always reinventing themselves and their products. Nike is doing this, Cramer said, with new technology in its shoes and marketing. 

10. Company culture. Nike is focused on improving the way they work. This is the least important item.

When Jim Cramer worked at his hedge fund, he asked analysts the following eight questions: 

No. 1: What's goingto make this stock go up, besides the stock market?

No. 2: Why is it going to go up? Is there something time sensitive?

No. 3: Is this the best time to buy it?

No. 4: Have you missed a lot of the move? How much has the stock gone up without you? Is it extended on a technical basis?

No. 5: Should you wait until it comes down a bit more? What's the harm?

No. 6: What do you know about this stock that others are missing? Is your instinct to buy based on general knowledge, and you're working on a herd mentality? Have you listened to the conference calls and done the research, or are you flying blind?

No. 7: What do you actually know about the company and sector? Do you have personal knowledge? Do you know how the cloud works, what stock trades with what, or where it lies in the sector’s food chain?

No. 8: Do you like this stock more than others you own and why? Is there anything to get rid of before buying this stock?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Prices Still new to all this, learning everyday, but I was wondering if anyone could help me further understand stock prices in general.
As an example I’ll use AAPL and NVDA. The current stock price of AAPL sits at $119.60 a share while NVDA is at $536.72 a share. The market cap of AAPL is $2T and the total revenue is $260.17B. In comparison the market cap of NVDA is $339.66B and total revenue is $10.92B.
Based solely on the maths, the stock prices don’t reflect the companies. Knowing only that both companies are in the tech industry you would have to guess that either AAPL is undervalued or NVDA is overvalued.
I am unsure how each stock price has evolved to where it is now. Future growth of both companies has huge potential, both have competitors on the same level in their main fields.
The answers I can think of are that AAPL has possibly diluted it’s stock several times over the course of the companies existence, leaving NVDA with a lot less stock to go around. Hype and future hype surrounding NVDA has driven up the stock price.

* Moderna (MRNA-US ) completed case accrual for the first interim analysis of the phase three trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate. Noted significant increase in rate of case identification in the last week, and as a result, it expects first interim analysis will include substantially more than 53 cases - the targeted trigger point for the analysis ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/c6c6b704-964a-4df6-8330-8e3290ea65fa)). Around 30K trial participants given either vaccine or a placebo, and 53 people had now tested positive for Covid-19. Independent data monitoring board will now compare infections in placebo group with vaccinated participants, to examine vaccine's effectiveness. Dr. Fauci speculated Moderna's vaccine would display a similar degree of efficacy as Pfizer's (PFE-US ) candidate, which demonstrated 90% efficacy and is based on comparable technology.

**Path of least resistance for stocks remains higher:**

* Stocks remain underpinned by several factors, including some more recent developments. Vaccine optimism, which has been part of the bullish narrative for a while, has ratcheted up further in the wake of the Pfizer news. According to the [Good Judgment Project](https://goodjudgment.io/superforecasts/#1420), the probability that a vaccine will be widely distributed by the end of March now stands at 88%, up nearly 40 points in just the last week. Removal of election overhang another key driver, particularly with the likelihood of a split Congress leaving market-friendly tax and regulatory policies largely in place. Central bank liquidity tailwind still seen as the most influential upside driver. In addition, there appears to be some additional monetary policy accommodation and targeted fiscal stimulus in the pipeline. Resilient corporate profit backdrop also in focus with S&P 500 earnings in 2021 now expected to grow 22%+ and exceed 2019 by 3%+.

**Growth sectors reversed some of the week's underperformance:**

* **Tech** and **consumer discretionary** led the market with the FAANGs higher. Software, semis, housing retailers, quick-serve restaurants were among better groups. Defensives outperformed, with HPCs, discount retailers among the **consumer staples** leaders. **Communication services** underperformed with FAANG components better, but DIS-US , telecoms a drag. **Healthcare** trailed on weakness in hospitals, distributors. **Financials** were lower with credit cards, regional banks, life insurers among weakest groups. **Industrials** saw declines across airlines, A&D, machinery. **Energy** underperformed after seeing big gains to start the week. Services, IOs among weaker groups. **Materials** sector was the worst performer with precious metals miners, commodity chemicals weaker.

**Rotation sustainability a big question for the market:**

* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-11/wall-street-jumps-on-value-train-amid-record-global-rotation?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how some Wall Street strategists think there may be more room to run when it comes to the latest rotation out of growth and momentum factors and into value and cyclical plays. However, it also pointed out that previous rotations have quickly fizzled and some are wary about giving up on growth, which is expected to remain a beneficiary of secular growth and disruption forces. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-value-options/options-buyers-shift-to-u-s-value-stocks-on-vaccine-hopes-idUSKBN27Q321) noted that after big buying sprees in tech earlier this year, options investors are now focused on small-caps and other economically sensitive companies, including travel and leisure names. Highlighted the potential for further upside in value and cyclicals as individual investors pile in amid a fear of missing out. However, also pointed out that activity has not reached the frenzied levels seen around tech names this year amid some skepticism about the sustainability of the rotations.

**States tightening coronavirus restrictions as hospitalizations, deaths continue to rise:**

* New York cases hit 4,820 today, highest since April, while positive rate of 2.93% just below 3% threshold that would force schools to shut down again. Governor Cuomo also announced closure of bars, restaurants, gyms at 10pm, capped indoor gatherings at 10 people ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-11/new-york-state-to-order-restaurants-bars-closed-at-10-p-m?sref=J9GPLx1B)).

[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/health/covid-indoor-venues-infections.html) noted a new analysis that found that restaurants, gyms, cafes and other crowded indoor venues accounted for some 8 in 10 new infections in the early months of the US coronavirus outbreak. The new restrictions in the US have not been anywhere near as aggressive as what has been seen lately in a number of European countries and there is no appetite for the draconian lockdowns put in place in March and April.  


**ECB's Lagarde signals more policy support coming:**

* ECB President Lagarde delivered a dovish [speech](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp201111~d01e03eb9c.en.html) at the central bank's Sintra conference. Despite the progress on the vaccine front, she cautioned on recurring cycles of accelerating virus spread and restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved. She highlighted the need for continued policy support to achieve inflation aim and deliver financing conditions necessary to support economy. She suggested that additional accommodation, which is widely expected in December, will come via the PEPP and TLTROs (and not rate cuts). The Street seems to be looking for a \~€500B increase to QE. Sell-side takeaways also discussed how Lagarde hinted at the need for cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy. She specifically discussed how monetary policy has to minimize "crowding-out" effects from fiscal policy that could create negative spillovers for households and firms.

**Trump's legal challenges mostly noise:**

* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/trump-legal-strategy-election-435853) discussed how President Trump's court battles over the election have produced few results and seem to be largely about trying to undermine the legitimacy of Joe Biden and riling up his base ahead of the runoff battles in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate. [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) noted it contacted election officials in dozens of states representing both political parties who said there was no evidence that fraud or other irregularities played a role in the outcome of the presidential race. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-challenges-state-count/2020/11/10/45148fac-2378-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html) said that six states where Trump has threatened to challenge is defeat have continued their push toward declaring certified election results in the coming weeks and his advisers have privately acknowledged that Biden's official victory is more of an issue of "when" than "if". [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-congress-republicans/u-s-republicans-hint-at-limited-time-for-trump-to-make-his-post-election-case-idUSKBN27Q350) noted that while leading Republicans for now support Trump's legal challenges, they believe he needs to quickly present significant evidence.

**Supreme Court signals it is unlikely to strike down Obamacare**

* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/supreme-court-obamacare-kavanaugh-435711), the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html) and other outlets discussed how the Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled that Obamacare would likely survive its third major legal challenge. Noted that at least five justices, including two members of the court's conservative majority, suggested the individual mandate was severable from the rest of the law. Other conservative justices also expressed doubt about whether Congress' decision to scrap the penalty for failing to secure health insurance because it could be no longer be justified as a tax, caused any harm to the plaintiffs. While the case has been widely viewed as weak, there still have been concerns about the fate of Obamacare under the court's enhanced conservative majority.

**Biden administration unlikely to have much impact on near-term Fed policy:**

* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-bidens-election-means-for-the-fed-11605090602) said that President-elect Biden's administration isn't likely to have any immediate effect on the bank's interest rate policy. However, Biden could have longer-run influence through opportunities to reshape Fed personnel. Biden could have three vacancies to fill on the Fed board, assuming GOP Senators allow the nominations of Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller to expire before 20-Jan and Governor Lael Brainard is selected as Treasury Secretary ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/economy/lael-brainard-treasury-secretary.html)). Chair Powell will also be up for reappointment in 2022. While some Democrats are likely to pressure Biden to replace Powell with a Democrat, there have also been calls for his reappointment, which will likely be supported by Senate Republicans. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-could-become-early-flashpoint-between-biden-and-mcconnell-11605029234) also noted Fed could be a flashpoint between Biden and Senate Majority Leader McConnell, who may attempt to stifle the President-elect's regulatory nomination.

**Biden's transition team offers possible signal on regulatory priorities:**

* President-elect Biden yesterday [announced](https://buildbackbetter.com/the-transition/agency-review-teams/) makeup of his "agency review teams," which will ultimately work with government agencies to help facilitate a smooth transfer of operations. Some press comment on (unsurprising) left-leaning/progressive makeup of this group, with [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/10/biden-transition-wall-street-regulation/) seeing roles for figures such as senior Obama Treasury official Michael Barr and Leandra English (who Trump ousted from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) signaling incoming administration's likely focus on enhanced regulation and Wall Street oversight (see [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/biden-transition-agency-review-gsa-standoff-435779) as well). [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2HW38V) suggested the list also shows union influence and possible plans to use of targeted federal spending to boost growth. A lot of speculation about cabinet appointments as well, with current and former Fed officials seen as candidates for Treasury Secretary, including Brainard, Bostic, Yellen, and Raskin ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/biden-cabinet.html))._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you could back before COVID... If you could go back around February this year what would you have shorted or bought ? I’ve certainly looked back on what would have been some pretty good plays (for example: the jump in Amazon share price, major airlines stock price dropping).
