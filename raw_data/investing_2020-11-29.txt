 Airbnb, Doordash Aim for Higher-Than-Expected Valuations Ahead of Debuts Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  are planning to release higher-than-expected valuation ranges for their initial public offerings, in the latest sign of strength in a booming market for new issues.

 Airbnb  is planning to target a range of around  $30 billion to $33 billion  - - using a fully diluted share count -- when the home-rental startup kicks off its investor roadshow Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. That is greater than  $30 billion  people close to the offering had expected.

 DoorDash , meanwhile, plans to target a range of around  $25 billion to $28 billion  on a fully diluted basis ahead of a roadshow expected to begin Monday. That is greater than the  $25 billion  people close to the offering had expected.

Typically companies and their underwriters seek to set relatively conservative initial ranges, with room to potentially price the shares at the high end or above them before trading starts.

It's not clear what per-share price ranges the companies will disclose.

 Airbnb  and  DoorDash  are on track for listings in mid-December -- typically a quiet month for offerings, ending a banner year for IPOs with a bang. There has already been a record amount of money raised in new issues on U.S. exchanges as soaring technology valuations entice a raft of private companies to join the public markets.

Activity has been buoyed by the record-setting run for the stock market. The Nasdaq Composite hit a new closing record on Friday during a holiday- shortened trading session. The  S&P  500 is a near record too, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted above the 30000 mark for the first time last week.

So far this year, more than  $140 billion  has been raised in 383 initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record high set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that dates back to 1995.

Both  Airbnb  and  DoorDash  have weathered the coronavirus pandemic as more people shun hotels in favor of houses for vacations or longer-term stays, and order out to avoid restaurants.

 Airbnb  was valued at  $31 billion  in a 2017 investment round. The  San Francisco  company's valuation fell to  $18 billion  when bookings plummeted at the outset of the pandemic as travel came to a virtual standstill.

 Airbnb  Chief Executive  Brian Chesky  quickly borrowed  $2 billion , slashed marketing spending, laid off a quarter of the company's staff and put many noncore projects on hold. Bookings at  Airbnb  rebounded by summer, though nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, as people increasingly seek houses for local getaways.

For  DoorDash , a valuation of more than  $25 billion  would continue what has been a sharp upward march.  San Francisco -based  DoorDash's  private valuation had already ballooned to more than  $15 billion  this year from just  $1.4 billion  in 2018 as it took an even greater share of the U.S. food-delivery market. It is now the biggest player in the sector.

For both companies, their roadshows will look different than they would have in the pre-Covid world. Executives at both companies will market their offerings to mutual funds and hedge funds in Zoom meetings rather than in a whirlwind tour across the country.

Both companies and their respective underwriters will set their final IPO prices based on feedback from investors in the roadshows.  Morgan Stanley  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  are leading  Airbnb's  IPO, while Goldman and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  are leading  DoorDash's ._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you bought QQQ right at the peak of the Dotcom Bubble (March 27, 2001), you will have broken out of red by July 2014, and would have caught up with SPY right about now **Typo in the title: March 27, 2000 was the dotcom peak**

Wall Street is bracing for Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) arrival to the S&P 500 Index on Dec. 18.

What Happened: The addition of the California-based automaker is expected to create challenges because of the company's size, $555 billion, and volatility. Tesla's share price jumped 40% right after the S&P 500 announcement on Nov. 16, and the addition comes at a time of pandemic-related volatility, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Tesla is the biggest company to ever join the index, and it’ll be the sixth largest by market capitalization. 

Elon Musk’s company might put $100 billion “in motion” when added, as funds try to sell other companies’ stock to buy Tesla’s, according to WSJ.

To help ease the potential trading chaos, some Wall Street managers recommend splitting the addition “over two trading days,” something that has never happened before, WSJ notes.

Ben Inker, who manages asset allocation at investment manager GMO believes any unpreparedness might have consequences. “The people who will pay the price if S&P screws up are the investors in passive S&P,” he says.

Why It Matters: Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 also happens the same day the so-called “quadruple witching” takes place. Every last Friday of the quarter marks the day when futures and options expire at the same time, which increases the volume.

This, investors say, might help with the liquidity that day but may also increase market volatility.  _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR short squeeze incoming?

Dave Lee recently released an interview of the CEO Daniel Schreiber on his channel a couple of weeks ago. He is currently doing a series investigating the company and has managed to catch SQ and PTON at 1/6, 1/4 their current price and was a super early investor of Tesla. 

During the interview they've touched on subjects such as Lemonade's advantage vs Incumbents. How Lemonade isn't reliant on a lot of legacy systems that larger insurance companies rely on such as off the shelf software some of which are still written in COBOL, broker based systems, etc… How it's harder for larger, less lean, insurance companies to just reinvent themselves and replicate Lemonade's software over night.

They've also talked about their expansion plans. Lemonade can expand anywhere geographically without having a physical presence there and they plan on releasing a new insurance product every 6-8 months with auto-insurance being a strong candidate after they've released life insurance.

They've talked about the lifetime value of their customers. Their initial strategy was to market towards millennials and first time insurance purchasers, which they’ve succeeded in. Every time a customer graduates from renters to home insurance, the profits generated by that customer increases by 6x with no additional cost to the company. Their profit margins doubled from 20% in Q3 2019 to 40% in q4 2020.

One important point that Schreiber made is that the total addressable market of insurance is at 4 trillion, and lemonade's market cap is still only at \~4 billion as of this writing. About 1/10 the size of a lot of large insurance companies. So they don’t need to outcompete, just do reasonably well in order for this to be a good investment. And yet JD Powers recently ranked Lemonade as #1 in customer satisfaction for renter's insurance. They've managed to completely automate purchasing and making insurance claims through their software. Their app takes 1/10 the time it takes for other insurance companies to give out insurance and to make insurance claims and 1/3 of their claims are resolved in \~3 seconds. 

Overall I genuinely think this is a great long term investment and if they succeed with life insurance and expanding to France that will increase my confidence in this company even further._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on $APL.V (APPULSE CORP). VALUE TRAP OR SURE LONG TERM WIN?!? Centrifuge business in the wake of a vaccine boom! CONTEXT:  
APPULSE Corp. is a centrifuge manufacturing company traded on the Vancouver stock exchange at 0,44$. It makes, sells, and rents centrifuges and centrifuge parts. It also provides maintenance services for said centrifuges.

I'm a new millenial investor, started to get interested in stocks since a year and a half and trying to learn the fundamentals. I found this stock while looking for value investments cause the idea of pumping even more money in the Tech bubble made me want to puke. I'm really interested if you guys have any insight on this company or investing in general. I bought this company for around 2% of my portfolio as some kind of a risky gamble for the following reasons:  


PROS FOR $APL.V BULLISH POSITION:

1) STEADY EARNINGS SINCE 2015 AND INSANE EARNINGS GROWTH SINCE EARLY 2019

Total revenues as of sept 2020 11.486mil. Earnings 1.254mil for a 10.9% profit margin. That gives an insane earnings growth 215% in the last year. This seems like a quite reliable company earnings wise since they've had stable positive earnings since 2015. Moreover, since early 2019, earnings have jumped on a cocaine trampoline, growing from 168k end of 2018 to 1.254mil as of sept 2020, with a profit margin rising from 1.7% to 10.9%)

2) P/E ratio 4.8x

Considering the Canadian Machinery Industry average P/E of 25.5x and average Canadian market P/E of 15.6x, this company looks highly undervalued according to P/E alone. 

3) P/B ratio 1.2x

Canadian Machinery industry average of 2.8x. Which means that this company is trading at roughly around the price of it's overall assets, the current market price takes no account of the reliable and growing earnings as well as the excellent company health/good handling of debt.

4) GREAT FINANCIAL HEALTH

Debt to equity ratio of 24.5% as of sept 2020 which is reasonable. Debt to equity ratio has reduced significantly from 37.8% to 24.5% in the past 5 years. Their short and long term liabilities are very well covered by their short term assets. This seems like a company who knows how to handle their debt.

5) COVID vaccines!!

I don't really know who the mains clients of that business are, but all I know is that centrifuges are essential to make vaccines. Millions and millions of new vaccine doses are gonna be prepared in the next few years, people are gonna need centrifuges. That earnings growth is certainly not going down for a least the next 2 years boys.

&#x200B;

CONS FOR $APL.V BULLISH POSITION

This is a small cap company with a market cap of 6.092mil only. The stock has virtually no volume at all.

This is where it gets me kinda sad. This looks to me like an overwhelmingly undervalued company. If you don't even consider growth, it should be valued at around 2 to 3$ a share based on P/E and P/B alone. Is there ANY way this company could gain in share price without pumping it out of proportion as a pump and dump scheme?!? And as a larger question, is there any point at all in investing in penny stocks/small caps?!?

Thanks for the advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox  December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

 They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

The Danish company [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORSTED.CO?p=ORSTED.CO&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORSTED.CO?p=ORSTED.CO&.tsrc=fin-srch) (Orsted) have transformed from a black oil company to a green giant.

Within 9 years, they have pumped everything up in their existing fields and they have recently launched a new climate ambition, where they wanna be C02 neutral in 2050. 

Let me know what you guys think.. 

Equinor is currently trading of 146.85 on the Norwegian stock exchange._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Have the rules of the "game" already changed? Okay, I am aware that I might get a looot of downvotes on this one. But even if this happens, the idea of this post is to sparkle a good discussion and conversations. And I am just sharing my thoughts. You might also notice that I'm not someone, who has been investing for 20+ years, but rather than 2+.

Recently I finished reading "The Intelligent Investor". It was the newer version with comments after every chapter, which are referring to "modern day" examples (very helpful). Amazing book, without a doubt. I'd recommend it to everyone. I would even read it one more time at some point.

In a very very short summary, the book teaches the following things:

1. Always check the fundamentals: read the yearly reports of a company for at least the last past 5 years. Always read the reports back to forth, because in the back usually they put the information nobody wants to see (debt, losses etc.).
2. Don't buy a stock only, because it's overhyped.
3. Don't assume that stocks only go up. 
4. It's much safer to invest in index funds and ETFs than in individual stocks.
5. It's much safer to invest long-term than short or mid-term.
6. 6% to 10% returns per year is the key. If you are getting more, you are doing something wrong (because it would be an indication that it's too risky and could crash any moment).

Etc. etc. you get it. 

While and after reading the book, one question couldn't get out of my mind: 

**Is everything in this book still relevant today?**

Doing your own DD and learning the fundamentals of a company is here to stay forever. This is for sure and everybody should learn it.

But I have to admit, I didn't know anything about the stocks I bought so far. I didn't even check their websites. And I made around 25k since June 2020 (the first time in my life buying a single stock): financial gain which is crucial for my current situation in life. I was always following the "herd-behavior" in the sub-reddits and bought what everyone else bought: NIO, TSLA, PLTR, WKHS, KODAK, KNDI, MODERNA, GME etc. And yes, I paid a few more dollars in fees by selling and rebuying again short-time, in order to secure profits. 

**How is this different from the time-period when "The Intelligent Investor" was written?**

I was written in 1949. Back then people didn't have access to relevant information like now. Not even back then, but up until the mid-end of the 90s. Even through the beginning of the 2000s access internet was still being rolled out.

Using the investment advice from the book "buy once and never sell for the next 40 years" is absolutely relevant for the 40s, 50s, 60s etc. You literally didn't have any other choice, because of the extremely high broker fees and no access to real-time information.

**What about today?**

I have the feeling that the situation today is a bit different. Almost every broker on the internet has little to no fees. You can get real-time alerts by a simple setting in "google alerts". And of course, there is RobinHood, where every kid nowadays can buy and sell as much as he wants. And you have a little device in your pocket, where you can monitor and control your portfolio 24/7.

I have 2 ETF positions (S&P 500 and MSCI World) and I put monthly 200$ in them. It's been 2 years since I have them and I haven't touched them since. However, the gains are not so impressive compared to the stocks, which are being discussed here. 

I'm not going to sell my ETFs. However, I just have the feeling that I made good money exactly by NOT following the advices from the bible of investing "The Intelligent Investor". And of course, there is no guarantee that this will continue to happen in the future. I am just saying that holding ETFs for 2+ years and doing nothing haven't worked out for me so far, compared to concentrating on single stocks for short- and mid-term.

**Disclaimer:** this is not the result of a scientific study and is based solely on my own experiences with investing so far.   


* What are your experiences regarding long vs. short/mid-term?  

* Is there someone here, who is actually still holding an ETF or index fund since 10/20+ years and can share some thoughts on the feeling of having it?
* Is there someone here, making money "stocks only"?

Thank you for the input._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question regarding institutional ownership Hi folks

I own a (relatively, for me) large chunk of RKT shares. Over the past month, this share has fallen flat and has seen relatively little price action. However, since this stock has IPO'd in august, institutional ownership has risen to 86% of the float. While this has the delay of 45-90 business days that 13-F filings allow, I have no sign that these institutions have sold so far. 

My question is the following: with only a couple of million shares remaining for retailers, what does this mean for price action? Obviously "smart money" is confident for the years to come and the shares are becoming increasingly scarce meaning supply and demand will drive the price up, but without the volume and retail buyers driving the price up will this happen?

I thank you in advance for your insights!

BA seems to have lost its way, everytime one reads an article online, every program is not going well and delayed. Let alone the embarrassing short comings of the 737.

I want to invest in NBAC which is trading at $17+ a share but their NBACR ticker is trading at $1.2-$1.4 a share. I know there is also a NBACW one for warrants but I don’t want to get into this.

I read that the NBACR is a discounted ticker for shareholders and it’s a 10:1 ratio, I don’t know if this is correct? 

Meaning if I bought 10 shares of NBACR it’s basically buying the stock for $12-$14 instead of NBAC stock at $17 

Can someone clarify and tell me what this NBACR ticker is, I read the “investopedia” on it but I’m too confused to fully understand what it means for the NBAC/NBACR tickers and how I should invest in this company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The '08 crash We have all seen The Big Short, Margin Call, Inside Job, that new documentary with Bush, Bernanke and Greenspan etc. that gives a pretty good picture on what led to the '08-09 crash. But I've always thought that's only half of the picture, and a bit washed out and simplified story of a complex situation in a very complex world.

One theory I've heard from a trader years ago is something that has always stuck with me and I've never seen or heard anyone mentioning it again. He said something along the lines of (can't remember word for word) - the crash actually happened because the banks had the MBS assets as Tier 1 capital on their books and when the assets got downgraded, they couldn't keep the assets as Tier 1 anymore and that froze up their credit. So they had to sell. And that the actual default rate on mortgages at the time was something like 5%.

I know in the end it's the same thing, but I've never seen or heard anyone mention that aspect of it, and it makes a lot of sense. I've searched for it on the internet but haven't found a good answer.

I'm utter trash when it comes to math, let alone investing math which is more made up than people want to think, so DCFs leave me in a cold sweat at night over how bad I am at the underlying math. For the denominator I tried three different scenarios with 10%, 12%, and 15%. Why those numbers? Because if your discount rate has to be the weighted average cost of capital and I know that $LB has had a history of 30.1% ROIC over the past 10 years then I can sit down and think that their cost of capital is much lower than this (this is intellectually lazy of me to do right now but I'm not exactly interested in doing a granular DCF for $LB). And also more or less it's a lot of finger wagging in the air. I took a 3 year average FCF (FCF=CFFO-capex just to be precise here) and got a range:    

Using 10%: $29,555,012,827.51, divided by 277K shares outstanding as of their most recent 10-K, gets me $106.70 a share.

Using 12%: $27,504,690,691.92, $99.29 a share 

Using 15%: $25,087,756,948.48, $90.57 a share.

I did 6 years of FCF projections for each of these (all the cash flows decline after year 1 and I don't fully understand why this is the case but they do) and then added all of them together to get the lump sum billions that are provided here. I have zero clue if this is how you do a DCF in any capacity, notwithstanding the clearly roughshod way that I'm going about it. Once I get here, how do I figure out what their estimated P/E would be? What their FCF yields would be? Other valuation multiples? How do I get there from what I just did? This is what trips me up when it comes to projecting future anything about a company. I don't know how to think in multiples very easily. So if it goes from its current share price to $106.70 a share then where does that leave EPS or P/E or FCF yields and so on?

The issue that I am seeing is that companies like BABA, NIO, etc. are audited by PwC LLP/PwC China and the PCAOB here in the US are unable to verify their work/procedures. In fact, this is explicitly stated in BABA's annual reports:

*PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities,* ***the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions****. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.*

This looks like an issue out of BABA's control -- **is this not an issue between PwC China and U.S./PCAOB, not BABA**? Thus, I ask again -- are companies like BABA screwed?
