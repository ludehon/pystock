Direct competitors, including Grubhub Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and the recently acquired Postmates, are typically valued at three to six times sales, Citron said in a research report. DoorDash was trading at 19 times. However, accounting standards can vary from company to company.

DoorDash should be worth $40 a share, Citron said, citing intense competition in the market for food delivery, lack of brand loyalty from customers and potential government regulation. That would represent a 74% decline from Thursday’s closing price.

DoorDash has gained 51% since its debut last week. It fell 2.4% to $154.21 on Thursday. DoorDash declined to comment.

The market debut of DoorDash was one of the most anticipated of 2020, already a banner year for startups going public. Back in June, private investors had valued the San Francisco-based company at $16 billion. When it opened for trading on Dec. 9, its fully diluted value topped $68 billion.

DoorDash, the largest food delivery app in the U.S., faces strong competition, notably from Uber and Grubhub. Uber tried to acquire Grubhub this year, until Just Eat Takeaway.com NV intervened. Uber bought Postmates instead.

Now DoorDash is eyeing delivery beyond just meals. The company started ferrying around convenience store items such as toilet paper this spring, which puts it in closer competition with giants such as Amazon.com Inc.

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

&#x200B;

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

&#x200B;

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

&#x200B;

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

&#x200B;

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 

&#x200B;

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

&#x200B;

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

&#x200B;

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

&#x200B;

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

&#x200B;

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. 

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.

2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.

3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.

4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.

5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

As stupid as some of these tips are they have helped me for the last 6 years in my retirement accounts. Also helped me to capitalize this last year with the 5k I had on hand

* **Buy and Hold**
   * People who tell you differently are wild. No need to short, do options, etc. I have achieved 120%+ returns in my 401k since I started investing 6 years ago doing only this.
* **Picking stocks - for me I do three things**
   * *I subscribe to news that will tell me about great companies* and then I look deeper into them.
   * *I ask myself if the 'opportunity' for this company is greater than 10x* their current market cap, someday down the road. 5 years, 10, 20. Pretty simple question, not looking for a ton of analysis here. Just want to believe convincingly that they will be significantly larger down the road.
      * ex. Amazon has a 1.6 T market cap. I bought some last month, I would say yes, they could certainly 10x from here. You could argue this, but for me I keep it simple.
      * I will look at similar companies with similar customer bases to bolster my thoughts on the company. Will also ask friends who use the product if it isn't something I use at my company.
   * *Are they 'executing' as a company.*
      * This one is more financial related but again, pretty simple. Normally I will look at revenue growth and speed of revenue growth related to their market cap. 10-20x depends on growth used to be a good figure. It is now not since many stocks are very expensive now.
      * Ex. AirBnB is an 80B market cap company right now. Their revenue is 4.8B for the year. Growing roughly 30% year over year.
      * There are other metrics you could look at like customer stickiness, multiples, profitability, etc I usually for my own sake go through the equity report by morningstar (they are unbiased0 unlike other research firms. But I don't think most people need to do this.
* I do these things but I have a 'philosophy' I sort of follow. Have loved E-commerce, software and any high margin businesses. Companies that I don't buy are ones that I feel could be easily replicated or made irrelevant if they don't adapt and invest into R&D. I also don't like companies that could potentially
   * Ex. DocuSign seems to be great but I have never bought them. I feel a similar service could easily be placed into SFDC, Dynamics, and other software that we use. Will this happen? Probably not, but it tarnishes my answer to will they 10x as a company and there are too many companies I am more interested in after. Even if it were replicated by large software providers I can't say that it would largely affect them as a company.

This excerpt is from the [Morning Brew](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/22409676.1103666/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3IvP2tpZD01MzNmYzI5ZQ/5cbe3beb24c17c6c936b328eB698b23c2)

Yesterday, Massachusetts securities regulators filed a complaint against the popular stock trading platform Robinhood for prioritizing “its revenue over the best interest of its customers,” according to documents reviewed by the WSJ.

The deets: Regulators argue that Robinhood exposes its customers to “unnecessary trading risks.” Robinhood says its app has “opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded.” They both might be right. 

Robinhood’s easy-to-navigate platform has attracted over 13 million insanely active traders. In June, it processed 4.3 million daily average revenue trades, more than every other brokerage combined.
But the complaint from Massachusetts says that’s exactly the problem. It claims that Robinhood gamifies trading in a way that “encourages customers to use the platform constantly,” without properly conveying the risks associated with betting your net worth on Virgin Galactic call options.  

Bottom line: Robinhood, currently valued at $12 billion, is reportedly eyeing an IPO in 2021.

TLDR; Buy SOLY (Soliton), stock will be a 5x in 2-years or less and 10x in 5-years or less. Technology/marketing/sales/etc… is being led by ABBV executives for eventual buyout and integration into their aesthetics business. New CEO is a Winklevoss 2.0 and the other brother is VP of marketing at AbbVie. Executives, management team, and medical advisory team all have strong ties to helping coolsculpting get bought out by Allergan for $2.48 billion.

Soliton is a company that develops, produces, markets, and sells a medical device that uses rapid acoustic pulse technology to provide minimally invasive (and non-invasive) treatment for several aesthetics treatments and enhancements. Pretty much they have invented a device that removes tattoos in 3 visits, reduces the appearance of cellulite, and can remove the appears of scars. Their business model is based on the “razor and blade” strategy where they sell the device then profit from each cartridge used in the treatments.

1) Invented by Christopher Capelli, an MIT engineer and medical doctor, who led the office of technology-based ventures at the university of Texas before leaving to co-found Soliton.

a. Significant because this man’s job was literally to review medical device technology. He must have seen hundreds or thousands of different devices in his time there and has seen which one’s workout and which don’t. Upon coming across this device (which maybe he made, maybe a student made, maybe it was a combination of both) he ups and quits his job because THIS IS IT! The one that will make him a billionaire

2) The Science Advisory Board for Soliton has 9 people who are members of the Zeltiq/Coolsculpting/Abbvie Medical Advisory team. Ironically enough, this device directly compliments the CoolSculpting treatments and the aesthetics portfolio that Abbvie is building out.

a. Significant because CoolSculpting has been growing and become more and more readily available and once Soliton’s RAP devices launches it will be directly integrated into each office.

3) The Winklevoss twins 2.0 are Brent and Brad Hauser. They both attended Standford where they were track stars they eventually made their way into medical device industry. Following a similar path they were both involved at the executive level in Zeltiq (ie. Coolsculpting) before the buyout and then were executives for Allergan (Allergan bought Zeltiq, then allergan was bought by Abbvie) and eventually Abbvie. Although working in different capacities they were closely tied in working on the projects/business.

a. Significant because what has happened is Abbvie seem to already be planting their people at Soliton to guide it in the right direction and ensure its success before they decide to add it to their portfolio. They told Brad, who was on the board of directors for Soliton while working at Abbvie, to take the CEO position so they have more control. Meanwhile ‘ol Brent is still at Abbvie, probably talking over thanksgiving dinner about all the money they will make when the buyout happens in a few years.

4) FDA approval has already been granted for the purpose of removing tattoos. Tattoos can now be removed in 3 visits vs what would normally take 8-10 visits. Soliton has hired our marketing team and distribution partners for their launch in Q2 2021. FDA approval for purposes of cellulite treatment should take place in the next 1-3 months. 

a. Significant because they have a real product with real results that adds real value to the market and by this time next year they will be rolling in revenue. FDA approval for the device has already been granted so the approval for cellulite treatment is damn near guaranteed. Then… it is on to the FDA approval for keloid and hypertrophic scar reduction which is supposedly a bigger market than tattoo removal and cellulite reduction combined.

5) Lack of options and small number of shares outstanding has caused institutions to overlook the company for now. This will probably change once volume picks up, revenues start showing next year, and cellulite FDA approval is finalized.

Why would Abbive just buy them now? Well, it’s a pain the a$$ to buy a company, especially one that hasn’t sold anything yet. I think they want to just leave the heavy lifting and regulatory crap to Soliton but once the FDA approvals go through, sales start happening, and they get concrete proof of the market potential, then they will step in. And with so many board members and executives with ties to Abbvie, who do you think will get the first opportunity?!

**TDLR**

Very undervalued UK based international engineering and built environment consultancy. Was still very profitable but was failing to compete with rivals and profits were falling. So has undergone costly revamp under well regarded CEO to turn a dinosaur company formed of many acquisitions operating independently to a modern efficient synergistic business operating under a reinvigorated brand. Investment from this predicted to start being realised shortly post covid. Business operates in important growing industries for the coming decades post covid. Dividend reinstatement likely to generate high returns for holders due to low share prices. Multitude of other positives listed and this is all backed up the the strong potential the business is acquired by a bigger fish like Tetra Tech at a much higher price per share than the current.

Recommendation is to Buy and hold for 1-2 years minimum, should get large value increase. I would suggest to hold to at least 120-140p (@120p is a 75% gain). Holding for 2yrs plus should hopefully in addition get hefty dividend returns and opportunity for price growth driven by future organic growth.

I would suggest buying and holding to around 130-140p then do as you please, a tidy 75% gain. This would likely take 2-3 years but the speed of recovery compared to previous estimates would suggest it will happen a lot quicker, particularly if it gets interest from outside the UK small cap investor bubble.

**Now -the intro**

Let me introduce this company and explain all the positives and negatives so you can come to conclusion that myself and others have come to that the negatives cannot ever outweigh the large amount of positives.

RPS group primarily delivers services like consultancy in the built environment, we are talking environment, sustainability, water, planning, climate change, renewable energy and is fundamentally a people orientated business ([Sectors | RPS (rpsgroup.com)](https://www.rpsgroup.com/sectors/). Yes these are the prime focus of government policies post covid which will be looking to drive the rebuild of their economies through supply side economics (infrastructure etc, see UK gov emission reduction targets, defence spending announcement etc). It operates across UK and NW Europe, the US & Asia pacific,

**Back story to the 5 yr price graph**

RPS up until 2017 grew through acquisition. This led to a rag tag bunch of companies that did not provide cohesive synergies and essentially operated completely separately but just under the RPS name. Which over time led to falling profit margins compared to rivals amongst a number of other things. Since Sep 2017 and the new CEO, John Douglas, formerly of Coffey International group, RPS group has undergone a full revamp bringing all the separate companies under the group together that could compete with rivals like ARUP, Mott Macdonald etc. This essentially is a strategy to bring the company into the modern age, a strong emphasis on creating a recognisable brand, reworking of performance and reward (RPS didn’t even have performance reviews in some sectors), realising synergies between different sectors of the business. Ultimately these are all to drive organic growth so that the company doesn’t rely on acquisition to grow, and to increase profit margins.

[LON: RPS - Google Search](https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk00uH2QuLsb3yQV5ncyFg_7qwRs-cw:1607351227172&q=LON:+RPS&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNkrOLMiwMeRaxcvj4-1kpBAUEAwDeMucJRQAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwif27L3ibztAhUOQkEAHQ4BD0MQ3ecFMAB6BAgEEBk&biw=1920&bih=937#scso=_5jvOX_DVNNaAhbIPh76N6Ao7:0)

However as a result of the investment required to make this happen, reported profits have been not been growing and the previously extremely generous divided was lowered, as is seen in the stock price graph between 2019 and 2020. The board expect the investment in this strategy would start to be realised in 2020-2021 however then Covid happened, leading to a 83% price drop. For good reason- unless you were lazy there was no reason to hold this stock, the opportunity cost for the 3-4year investment horizon is too long. Therefore was better to sell and seek opportunity elsewhere. As with other UK based companies Brexit has subdued investment as well, leading to excessive price decreases not observed elsewhere in the world. Since the all time low in April a number of investors have been singing its praises which has now brought the price up to the current level as investors have gradually cottoned on.

**Positives**

* The CEO plus M & A -As mentioned before John Douglas took over in 2017 having previously led to high acclaim Australian outfit, Coffey International group, who were acquired by California based Tetra Tech. Now this history is interesting as Tetra Tech have commented that they are looking to acquire “water consulting capability in the UK” and this is for the AMP7 cycle, which has recently begun – an RPS speciality and one of its largest sectors. In addition to this RPS and Tetra Tech services overlap. M&A’s are the story of the built environment sector. For example WSP Group, another RPS suitor recently gobbling up Canadian consultant Golder. At the valuation WSP paid for Golder, it would put RPS shares at 152p compared to their current 80p. There is further such evidence like this that can be found that supports the idea RPS is significantly undervalued compared to its peer group. I would encourage everyone to have a good scout through this forum which can provide sometimes good info and also links to wider research on fundamentals. [https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/rps-RPS/share-chat](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/rps-RPS/share-chat)
* **Board Ownership** \-Since 2017 the board of RPS have purchased significant amount of shares at prices well above 100p, if they believe that these prices represent value then they are definitely value at 80p or less. “The CEO is 58 and since joining RPS has purchased in the market no less than £1.36 million of RPS stock at prices between 44p and 158p. He also has options over another 1.7m shares bringing his total potential beneficial ownership of stock up to around 3.5million shares valued at today’s prices at around £2 million”. Linking to the CEO & M & A section ”In the event of a takeover all options would vest and be payable. In summary, the CEO has some M&A history, is of an age where he may well wish for a quieter life and he also owns a sizable amount of RPS stock at an average price of just 39p including his nil cost options”.
* **Dividend reinstatement -** Before the large scale revamp the company provided dividends around 9.5p which upon previous share prices was between 3-7%. This is based on revenues of around 600m and profit margins of 9-11%. Margins post covid are expected to return initially to a conservative 9% with growth over time coming from the revamp. Best in class, Tetra Tech, are 14%. Revenues also expected to recover to plus 550m. In September shares were diluted by 20%. If the initial level of dividend was reinstated this would be a 7.6p dividend. Its been noted by the current board this level of dividend was unsustainable at least recently, but potentially not in 3/4 years when the investment in the revamp is realised. A 7.6p dividend on a 68p share is a return of 11%. A more realistic dividend in the short term of 4-5p would give 5-7%, still very appetising especially given there would likely be a strong share price increase along this.
* **Its UK listed** \-As mentioned before UK listed stocks have generally taken a pounding the last few years and in particular during Covid compared to others worldwide, largely due to Brexit. This had led to a spate of analysis recently from the likes of Goldman Sachs suggesting the best value at the moment is to be found in the UK.
* **55% of Fee Revenue is from government or quasi-government organisations**. This provides significant protection to the business for any potential future Covid complications and has provided significant protection during the pandemic so far. As the business has retained virtually all its staff through COVID because of this it is in a prime position to take the new opportunities present post covid.
* Like mentioned in the company introduction it’s a people business (its only capital really is offices). Therefore the business can respond quickly to changing demand by just changing its personnel which is important in the post Covid economy. The board has importantly and strongly recognised that as a people business, its smart to invest further into its people, which was not the case pre 2017.
* RPS already focuses on **sectors that are key for government policy in the coming decade** , particularly as governments are looking to supply side economics like infrastructure spending to drive economic recovery - sustainability, urbanisation, climate, water, planning, energy etc.
* **Incoming realisations from the company revamp are not yet factored into the price**. This business was priced at 180p + at the old state of the business, which should not be a profitable as the revamped business, the realisations of which, Covid complications pending, should occur over the next 1-3 years. From the website upgrade you can get a feel of the level of the changes that have been worked across all levels and elements of the business.

[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/andXbL5)

&#x200B;

* **High level of institutional ownership** (72%) given its not part of any index funds (from what I can see) – people on here love to talk about the smart money, well here it is, betting on RPS and giving price expectations of 150p (See recommended reading).
* **No short positions** – I’m not sure how accurate this is but it suggests there are no longer any short positions and that all previous positions were reduced over time. This indicates the downward trend in prices since 2017 is not reflective of the actual state of the business. [RPS Group Short Positions. RPS Shorts for 2020 Who is shorting RPS Group. (lse.co.uk)](https://www.lse.co.uk/ShareShortPositions.asp?shareprice=RPS&share=RPS-Group) , which I already have explained is the case anyway tbh.

**Negatives**

* Ongoing legal issues in the US could damage reputation and hurt financially. However management seems confident its not a significant issue.
* Debt – A few commentators have raised concerns over debt levels however when I have spoken to people about it they have not considered it to be an issue. Also RPS have been paying down debt levels during Covid, again a signal of the strength of the business.
* The share price rises fast, but they fall quicker. Its common to see RPS in the top 5 fallers or top 5 risers in the FTSE All Share index when its on a fall or rising streak. Therefore unexpected news can hurt you but also get you big gains. Post addendum: I actually wrote this bit 2 weeks ago when i tried to post this before. Then low and behold it became apparent a brexit deal was unlikely and it dropped from 80p to 63p in a few days, being in the top 2 biggest fallers in the ftse all share index on two of these days.
* Listed in the UK – Uncertainty due to a no Brexit deal. Whilst RPS is barely directly affected, as it is a UK listed stock it still feels the effects, which like mentioned before above are magnified in RPS shares.
* I’m not sure how common this was in this industry but RPS rather than losing staff chose to in most circumstances freeze pay since Covid and for management pay cuts. These cuts aren't considered for reinstatement til April, probably because they want to report very healthy profits. The effects of the loss of staff morale from this and potential staff turnover are unknown.

Background (skip down to "Question" section if you don't need the context):

I freely admit that, earlier this year when I began to trade stocks, I had no real idea what I was doing -- I had a brokerage account through my ESPP with work and added some funds to start buying stocks that a friend recommended.

I made mistakes, including buying 100 shares when I meant to buy 10, mixing up limit and stop orders, and also got flagged twice for a good faith settlement violation.

I started studying more and found videos recommending to use ThinkOrSwim, so I signed up with TD Ameritrade.  I made the mistake of selling off my shares, some at a loss, with the intention to buy back on TD Ameritrade.

Question:

I sold some shares at a loss on my first brokerage platform in calendar year 2020, and then within a few weeks bought back shares on the new brokerage.  As I now understand it this is a wash sale violation, as I bought back before the 31-day window expired.

I am presently holding these "new" shares and also they are currently still at a net loss.

I had planned to hold the shares into 2021, but I am not sure if it would be more than a full year before I sell them or not.

How should I best approach this?  Is it better to sell them before 2021 and close out the positions so that I can accurately report the wash sale violation for tax year 2020?  If I hold them until 2021 or beyond, what do I need to do for reporting in tax year 2020 for this situation?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Elon Musk's Boring Company buys industrial site near Tesla's under-construction Texas factory https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-boring-company-texas-warehouse-austin-tesla-factory-site-2020-12

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/Nj34Qdp) leading the way up 0.5% and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/WcwDrN2) also finishing in the green, up 0.18% and ended over the 3700 level for just the 2nd time in history, while the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/Sdvkw4L) lagged and lost 0.15%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/w62QhvW) continuing to drop 1.7%, back to some more normal levels after the recent spike near 25.

Despite the broad market rally [yesterday](https://ibb.co/Z2qpxL2), about 55% of companies were losing ground on average volume, as we saw the Tech and Consumer Discretionary [sectors](https://ibb.co/BftQNpd) leading the way, while the only sector losing more than 1% for the day was the Utilities sector. As only Large-Cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/cyY67bQ) from the tech sector finished in the green, while small-caps and especially value play lagged behind.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/5LKrKdx) that most of the big tech names, Microsoft, Amazon, NFLX and even Alibaba which has suffered lately finished up well into the green, while the industrials and utilities were a big block of red.

We also got some economic data yesterday, with business [inventories](https://ibb.co/jZndKhQ) rising more than expected as sales increased by 0.9% month over month. We also saw retail [sales](https://ibb.co/XjqJyhW) falling 1.1% in November from the previous month, but this may be misleading, as sales actually rose by more than 4% year over year and by almost 6% after stripping out auto, gas and retail sales. 

We also continue to see the housing demand market being [strong](https://ibb.co/cTT9BjX) as the housing market index was down from the previous month, but came in at the second highest level ever.

One last number that we got was a reading on the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/Mg0pgHq), which came in at 55.7, below expectations and the last month number. This was the lowest reading in three months as growth momentum keeps slowing down as more restrictions are re-imposed, but this is still a strong expansion of the manufacturing and services.

[Today](https://ibb.co/fGq6Bqc) we will get some critical economic data, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims and housing starts, while we will also see get other important numbers later in the day.

So, we also got the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/ynQhYRg) yesterday, which for me personally, was a good indicator that stocks may still go up, as the bullish number of investors declined by 4.6%, with most of them switching to a neutral view of the stock market. There are still a lot more investors that are bullish compared to the historical average of 38% but, this is an improving in the last weeks, as this is a very good contrarian indicator. When more people tend to be bearish that is usually a good sign that you should just go and buy stocks, as you can mostly buy them at a discount, while when to many people are bullish, there is a significantly bigger risk of a pullback or correction nearing the stock market.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/5BwsTzH) we saw the FED keeping rates unchanged and signaling that they will continue to keep a near-zero rate through 2023 to support the economic recovery.

They also announced that the economy is expected to contract by only 2.4% in 2020, that is a big improvement from a contraction of 3.7% previously expected. They also expect the economy to grow by 4.2% next year and by more than 3% in 2022, with both revisions also being up from the previous estimates. They also vowed to keep buying bonds until there is substantial economic progress in the US, so they are expected to continue to buy $120B, with $80B in Treasury securities and another $40B in mortgage-backed securities.

Other revisions in the projected economic data also showed an improved outlook in the unemployment rate, which is expected to drop to 3.7% by 2023.

The FED Chief Powell also reinforced the commitment to aid the economy with even more easing if it deems it necessary while also suggesting they will give ample warning before tapering bond purchases.

This was happening while the congress was still haggling over details on a bigger $900B relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/PQBrH2Y). We also saw a major change from the last day as now it is expected that it will include a 600$ stimulus check and extended unemployment benefits. I think this must be agreed on as soon as today if it stands a chance of passing by the end of the week, even if Congress leaders have repeatedly told they will remain in session as long as needed, even working through the weekend, they should just put their act together and pass the stuff they can agree on so that uncertainty goes away, at least for the moment.

We also have some interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/vHCS87T) reports coming today with FedEx, BlackBerry and General Mills.

[FedEx](https://ibb.co/D89m06D) is expected to post an EPS of over 4$, that would be up almost 60% over last year with an operating Margin of 7.1%. FedEx has also just received an upgrade from Credit Suisse based on accelerating e-commerce trends with a longer and stronger holiday season than expected.

[JABIL](https://ibb.co/tL2qNRb) just reported while writing this post a nice surprise due to the high demand in the new Apple lineup, with a beat of 34 cents on earnings and almost $800M on revenues. The stock skyrocketed after the release.

We also got [Lennar](https://ibb.co/f9pLZxP) earnings after the close yesterday, as they beat the estimates easily, while also offering better numbers in new orders and guidance. As they expect more than 62K deliveries and 24% gross margins in FY 2021, that is up from 53K and a 20.6% gross margin in FY2020, this pushed the stock up 3% in after hours, in an unexpected move to the upside for me, despite my expectations for a great quarter for the company.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.

Meanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.

We Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

After several days full of reading and deeper understanding of the market and his movement for mid to longterm I'm asking myself should I change my strategy. The first 3 months I began with etfs and nothing special mostly hold. now I'm more midterm focused waiting for good opportunities and low points from charts who will "definitely" rise longterm. Doing way more buy/sell orders. I wonder myself what's the risk value if I would put like 40% in one hydrogen stock 30% in an renewable stock whatever it is and hold them long term and 30% for "weekly trades" or if I go like 70% one hydrogen stock and 30% "weekly trades". I got a feeling I would "loose* a ton of money if I do lots of trades through the month just to get some percentage winnings every time and besides that being really stressed about the movement of the market or I can chill and relax and only read news sometimes to stay on point. What's your suggestions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How did you learn the stock market? I am new to investing in stocks. Like only 3 months new. I am trying my best to learn on investopedia and few investors I follow. But what is the best way you learned? Can you drop some educational resources and tool for your girl? I would greatly appreciate it! Ready to make some money!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2021 stock picks Hi all, as the title suggests, what are your 2021 stock picks based on growth (stock price)? Based on a 3-5 year span (i.e., 2021-2026) rather than a conventional 1 or 10 year holding plan.

Please include your reasons (dd) on each stock if able. However, simple reasoning would suffice as to promote ideas and investment knowledge._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dip-buying strategy There’s frequent advice here about “buying the dip,” but that advice usually doesn’t specify where that cash should come from, or how long the increased position is held. I have been using the following strategy and was wondering if there is anything I’m overlooking.


First, I have a pre-planned allocation of stocks that I plan to hold long-term, and then leave about 10-20% of my portfolio in cash. When one of these stocks drops, I buy the dip with cash, usually with a number of shares that is a function of my current position. My concern is that if I keep that increased position, I’m basically constantly reallocating my portfolio based on dips.


To avoid constantly changing strategy, I still buy the dip, but as soon as the price returns to the pre-dip level, I sell the extra shares. This basically allows me to profit from the dip without changing my long-term strategy.


Is there any huge risk that I’m missing? I realize that if I buy the dip and it drops further, I just magnified my losses, but that is part of any dip-buying strategy. I minimize this by only applying the strategy to stocks that I have confidence long-term. The only issue I see is the extra taxes on the dip profits, and the opportunity cost of not just investing all the cash, which would prevent dip buying._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ETF Investment Pie Opinions on the following investment pie for long term:

Hi everyone, since I'm from Europe and I mostly use € to buy everyday stuff, I don't want to expose myself too much to the USD. I'd like to find some good European companies to buy with some EUR/GBP/CHF, but when I do some research I find it way harder than researching US companies, and the usual European top companies are oil/banks which I don't believe will have a lot of growth in the next years, compared to tech for example.

Implied volatility is derived from the option's price, which is plugged  into an option's pricing model to indicate how volatile a stock's price  may be in the future. Moreover, it affects the extrinsic value portion  of option premiums. If investors are [long options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp),  an increase in implied volatility would add to the value. This is  because the greater the volatility of the underlying asset, the more  chances the option has of finishing in-the-money

I don't understand why implied volatility would add to the  value.  *''The greater the volatility of the underlying asset, the more  chances the option has of finishing in-the-money''*

I make sure to check multiple factors before I buy a conpany. Now I see that a lot of banks and insurance companies have low altman- Z scores (which could indicate bankruptcy in the ongoing 24 months). 
This is peobably not entirely correct because it would be unlikely that most corporate banks are going bankrupt (wells Fargo, BAC). So I think the altman-Z score does not apply to Banks and insurance's. Can someone tell me why.

I recently transferred my 23-year existing stock into a new broker and began expanding my portfolio. As the year closes, and I sold off some of my shares from the existing stock - to diversify myself into other holdings - now I'm preparring to report the realized gain for taxes... I've done extensive research and I have gotten as much information as physically available to me, after weeks of historical coys, etc.

At first my research suggested that it's the fair market value on the day I received it... HOWEVER, further research corrected me, and actually it's the original cost basis from way back when (and I'm SURE that my grandfather probably held these SPECIFIC shares a lot further past 1997, since it was likely first in, first out - or something like that, idk) my grandfather purchased them.

The original broker has advised me that they have no other access beyond the date they appeared in my account. I'm at a loss how to proceed...

I hold mostly ETFs, best to let someone else do the thinking until I'm confident.

However, I do own 100 shares of Aphria. And after the merger with Tilray, ([https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-tilray-m-a-aphria-idUSKBN28P30L](https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-tilray-m-a-aphria-idUSKBN28P30L)) , I will supposedly have 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each share of Aphria. But the math isn't adding up for me.

Currently I have 100 shares of APHA with trades at $8.17/share, so total value of $817.

At some point (when? how?) I will have 83.81 shares of TLRY, currently trading at 9.43. That total comes to 790.32

So, I'll lose money here. Given this knowledge would you close your position in Aphria first thing tomorrow? There would be tax implications on that as I picked up Aphria near the bottom several months ago. But then I don't know the tax implications of a deal like this.

The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis and Palantir Foundry.

Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.[6] In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. 

Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[7][8] 

Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.[9]

I sold off the last of my NVDA the other day.

I bought into them back at the dawn of modern Artificial Intelligence (2016ish) when they were at the forefront of AI and it looked like they were going to be the future. And they were. They went from $14\~$22 as I bought in, to about $540\~$575 as I sold. It was a good run but I realized I had to cash out.

While I don't think the company is done, I do think, first Apple punched them in the kidney by not continuing to support their products. Then, Tesla knocked them down by stealing their engineers and making their own chip. Then AMD kicked them around by making faster cheaper chips that use less power. Then Apple thrust a knife in their backs with the M1 chip having neural specific cores embedded in its silicon. The only thing holding them up was the 3000 RTX series that they've failed to deliver and the CUDA architecture that most AI devs still use.

Nvidia may have a comeback with the 4000 series or by fixing their insane card shortage before AMD can, but it's only a matter of time till AI dev broadens to other, probably ARM and probably in the cloud, chips that are designed specifically for dev work and allow their models to be easily deployed on existing or soon to be existing devices. And all that will be left will be gamers.

It's sad that in essence, Apple slaughtered this pillar of ingenuity and development. But I had to finally let them go entirely after they then upset the entire gaming world with the unboxing fiasco. I'm not going to say they are dead as a company, but I think their growth is over. For now. Thanks for the 2500+% gain pal.

The url for their income statement is : [https://investors.tatamotors.com/financials/75-ar-html/pdf/statement-profit-loss-consolidated.pdf](https://investors.tatamotors.com/financials/75-ar-html/pdf/statement-profit-loss-consolidated.pdf) and balance sheet : [https://investors.tatamotors.com/financials/75-ar-html/pdf/balance-sheet-consolidated.pdf](https://investors.tatamotors.com/financials/75-ar-html/pdf/balance-sheet-consolidated.pdf)

Currently for the COGS I am adding the following columns : 

 Cost of materials consumed ,  Purchase of products for sale ,  Changes in inventories of finished goods, work-in-progress and products for sale and the net change of inventories from the balance sheet.

However I am not sure if I should add " Employee benefits expense " and other employee related to sections from the income statement._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What’s up with index funds losing 10% in a day? One of my mutual funds lost 10% the other day and today one of my index funds (SWHFX) lost 10%. It’s not a big deal, but I’m confused as to why. I checked the holdings to see how they did today and most of them barely moved. 

Is this some kind of rebalance or something like that? The fees aren’t high enough to make this kind of impact but I can’t seem to find anything that would explain the big drop. 

Anyone have any ideas?


Answered already. Here’s more info for others: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgainsdistribution.asp_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/17/2020 My Plays For 12/17/2020:

I use the RSI, Stochastic, MACD, and 10-50-200EMA Lines.

**$AOS:** Such a fantastic up trending channel, with such high success. It is sitting at the POC channel as well - which is a support. Stoch is low, and RSI is almost under 40. Beautiful setup.

**$BLL:** A snack of a channel partnered with the 200EMA support? Yes Sir! It is right above support; RSI & Stochastic are oversold, and MACD is super low.

**$CARR:** Just took off of 200EMA and channel, and now holding above previous resistance? Gorgeous, look to buy in on the pull back!

**$CGEN:** In my area of value, 4/4 so far om 10% 3 day swings in this price range. IT reverses at 40RSI, Stoch is low, showing bullish divergence, and this support area again, is very strong.

**$EDU:** Another delicious channel up, that bounced off the 200EMA. Look to buy in off of the 50EMA bounce as it has a small pullback. Such a great setup.

**$GFF:** Much more calm uptrend, and it is right above the channel again. POC is acting as support, and this is about to be another great value. IT just needs to break the 200EMA to be fantastic.

**$LNT:** Another great channel, retesting the downtrend it just broke. RSI and Stoch indicate a small pullback more, but this is a great value at a channel / support combo.

**$ROK:** I have no idea; which trend line it wants to respect, but they are close. Simple triangle play that may drop to the 200EMA, but it has massive breakout potential.

**$RRC:** Another uptrend that is now becoming a triangle play as well, but at triangle support. A breakout either way is destined to happen, and it will be strong.

**$T:** A little harsh of a slope up, but a uptrend none-the-less. Bouncing off the 50EMA, but may come down to the channel. Super easy read here if it lives off the 50EMA.

**$TWNK:** This also is bouncing off the 50EMA, which is partnered with a support. Good chance of living here, but if not buy in at the golden channel line, Stoch can't get much lower.

**$VMC:** Such a beautiful ascending play into a triangle, RSI was oversold, and now pulling back which is great for a buy in here. What a beautiful chart._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about APHA and TLRY merger “Under the terms of the deal, Aphria shareholders will gain 0.8381 shares of Tilray stock for each Aphria share they own under the deal terms”

By using the language “gain” does this mean that 100 shares of APHA will be 183.81 shares of the merged company?


Orherwise, they would have said that the shares will be “converted”?


Is this correct?

I have a theory about the stock market’s bull run that seems so simple and naive that it must obviously be wrong.

Also the US dollar index has been sliding since March.

**Industry Overview**

Domino’s competes in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza industry with various competitors. The U.S. market is estimated to be \~$37.8bn and steadily growing. This is the second-largest category in the broader $279bn QSR market. The QSR pizza industry is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in, and carryout. Unsurprisingly carryout and delivery are the two largest segments.

Domino’s is the leading market share leader for U.S. pizza delivery and the second-largest market share for carryout. The four industry leaders, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s Pizza, Domino’s, and Little Caesars Pizza account for 61% of the U.S. pizza delivery market and 51% of the carryout market.

The international pizza market is more underdeveloped than the United States. Domino’s is one of three companies with a global presence.

**Business Overview**

Domino’s was founded in 1960 by two brothers. The two brothers initially focused on opening stores near college campuses and military bases. Fast forward almost three decades and Bain Capital buys 93% of the business in 1998. A few years later, Bain proceeds to IPO Domino’s in 2004, and it’s been a public company ever since.

Domino’s has three different revenue segments:

* U.S. Stores
* International Franchises
* Supply Chain

We’ll dig into these different business lines and how they all work.

**U.S. Stores**

U.S. stores consist of both company-owned stores and franchised stores. Roughly 6% of all U.S. stores are company-owned. These stores are typically used for testing sites for new innovation as well as training and developing future talent.

There are more than 6,100 U.S. stores, with \~340 stores being company-owned and \~5,800 being franchisees. The \~5,800 franchised stores are operated by 777 U.S. franchisees. These franchisees are able to benefit from Domino’s brand image with a low capital investment. The largest U.S franchisee operates more than 176 locations.

Domino’s has a rigorous process for U.S. franchisees. Those interested in being a franchisee must manage a store for at least a year and graduate from its franchise management school program. This is successful as there is a 99% franchise agreement renewal rate. Franchisees must pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales and certain technology fees.

Stores must also contribute 6% of sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. These contributions go into Domino’s National Advertising Fund, which is a not-for-profit advertising subsidiary of Domino’s.

**International Franchises**

Domino’s has more than 10,894 international franchises in more than 90 markets. The main source of revenue from these stores is royalty payments. Domino’s top ten international markets account for 63% of international stores.

Domino’s grants franchisees exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic regions. This means they can create their own Domino’s in international markets. They control the franchisee options, the supply chain centers, and other decisions. These franchisees pay an initial one-time franchise fee and a fee upon the opening of each additional store. The master franchisee pays a continuous 3.0% royalty fee on sales,

**Supply Chain**

Domino’s operates 19 dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers, 1 thin crust manufacturing center, 1 vegetable processing center, and 1 center providing equipment and supplies to U.S. and some international stores. The management team is continuously looking to expand and build more centers.

Domino’s sells food and supplies to more than 6,600 stores. Domino’s believes that franchisees buy directly from them due to cost savings, efficiencies, quality offerings, and consistency. Franchisees also benefit from profit-sharing arrangements with supply chain centers. This program offers participating franchisees 50% of its regional supply chain center’s pre-tax profits.

**Total Addressable Market**

The global QSR pizza market is already well established with the biggest opportunity being in expanding in international markets and same-store sales growth in more established markets such as the U.S. One of my main concerns is just how big the pizza market can be. I feel as though the pizza market is already well-established, but Domino’s talks about their fortressing strategy which is adding more Domino’s stores within one area to improve on delivery times, customer service, and cost efficiencies (cheaper to deliver pizza the closer the customer), and other important areas.

**Competitive Advantages**

1. **Brand.** Domino’s is one of the strongest brands in the world. They benefit from brand recognition almost anywhere you go in the United States and I’d bet it’d be similar in some foreign countries. There are definitely some die-hard Domino’s fans and then there’s also your local pizza restaurants that arguably have better pizza than Domino’s but these companies can’t compete on price. Basically, when ordering from Domino’s you know what you’re getting.
2. **Scale.** Since Domino’s is the largest pizza company, it’s able to benefit from economies of scale through purchasing power over suppliers, can test changes on a small scale, and then roll these features out globally. Scale also gives Domino’s the benefit of operating leverage. As the international franchise store count grows, Domino’s will collect royalty fees that do not require extensive operating margins so operating margins grow slower than international royalty fees giving Domino’s operating leverage for this segment of the business. The same can be said for US stores that are not company-owned.

**Financials**

Domino’s breaks down revenue into U.S. stores which include company-owned stores, franchise stores, U.S. franchise advertising, then supply chain, and international franchise royalties and fees. Other important financial numbers are global retail sales growth, same-store sales growth, and total store count. These numbers are all listed below.

**2019:**

* Total revenue = \~$3.6bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$1.3bn
* Supply chain = \~$2.1bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.6bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 8.0%
* Total store count = 17,020
* U.S. stores = 6,126
* International stores = 10,894

**2018:**

* Total revenue = \~$3.4bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$1.3bn
* Supply chain = \~$2.0bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.6bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 10.8%
* Total store count = 15,914
* U.S. stores = 5,876
* International stores = 10,038

**2017:**

* Total revenue = \~$2.7bn
* U.S. Store revenue = \~$0.8bn (but did not include advertising revenue)
* Supply chain = \~$1.7bn
* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn
* EBIT (Operating income) = \~$0.5bn
* EBIT margin = 16.6%
* Global retail sales growth = 13.0%
* Total store count = 14,856
* U.S. stores = 5,587
* International stores = 9,269

**What’s Interesting**

Domino’s has outperformed Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies since it’s IPO in 2004. This isn’t random. Domino’s has been able to build a brand and continue to expand in the U.S. and internationally while rewarding shareholders.

Domino’s has a share repurchase program and also dolls out dividends each year. This combined with revenue and net income growth is a good recipe for any successful company.

Domino’s also seems to be the original cloud kitchen model. Many of its stores do not include seating which would increase capital expenditures. The majority of Domino’s business is carryout or delivery.

**Future Questions**

1. **How long is Domino’s runway?** Domino’s is already a mature company with more than 17,000 stores worldwide. Future growth will come from cost efficiencies and some store openings, but I feel like it’d be hard for Domino’s to make a case that store count can double worldwide because of how many stores are already in existence. International store count can probably double at some point in time, but going from even \~11,000 international stores to \~22,000 will be a big challenge. The good part is that royalties and other fees associated with international franchises are basically pure profit since international franchises are operated by a master franchisee that takes care of all the headaches in foreign countries. Through operating leverage, if the international franchise store count doubles, then the profit will more than double. Domino’s only has a market cap of \~$15bn meanwhile companies like McDonald’s have a market cap of \~$150bn. Domino’s definitely has room to expand, so if I were to do a deep dive on Domino’s I’d have to answer the question of how many stores can Domino’s operate throughout the world.
2. **What effect does Uber, Grubhub, DoorDash, and the food delivery market have on pizza delivery and carryout?** In the past, carryout and delivery were typically done by pizza companies. These companies often don’t have any seating in their stores and therefore benefit by having less capital tied up in stores rather than inventory, buying back shares, or paying dividends. Families, college students, and professionals would order a pizza rather than ordering a bunch of different food from a Chinese restaurant or whatever other food option there is available. How does the new wave of food delivery companies impact pizza’s delivery and carryout appeal? Do families increasingly order from somewhere else instead of the pastime of fresh pizza delivery? Are the costs of ordering from Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash too expensive for a typical family of 4? Does the cheap cost of pizza relative to other options give Domino’s and its pizza staying power in this new age of food delivery?

**Conclusion**

Domino’s is an interesting company that I’d have to put in the more mature bucket. It’d be interesting to figure out if food delivery is a net positive or net negative for Domino’s and other pizza companies. Domino’s has historically been a great investment for hopefully many people, but it might be too late for me. Domino’s is already at the stage of giving out dividends to its shareholder base and that’s not what I’m personally looking for. I’m a young investor so I’m looking for growth and I’m not worried about short-term volatility in the pursuit of long-term gains.

**Fun Facts**

There are international Domino’s franchises that are public companies. Not all of these companies are specific to Domino’s and these firms often combine various franchises into one holding company. But here’s a shortlist:

* ASX: DMP - Domino’s Pizza Enterprises
* BMV: ALSEA - Alsea
* L: DOM - Domino’s Pizza Group
* L: DPEU - DP Eurasia
* NS: JUBLFOOD - Jubilant Foodworks

Domino’s has very different food options depending on local customs. Some of these were highlighted throughout Domino’s 10-K such as the Mayo Jaga in Japan (bacon, potatoes, and sweet mayonnaise), the Saumoneta in France (light cream, potatoes, onions, smoked salmon, and dill), and some others. I thought these were funny and it’s always interesting to learn more about different customs in foreign markets.

The thing I’ve noticed is that people often times take companies that trade at a premium, viceversa and claim that their good or bad buys because of that.

I don’t have much time today but this is the jist of it.


Just because a company is trading at a forward p/e of 60 and has a crazy market cap does not mean the company that’s trading at a forward p/e of 7 with a undervalued market cap is a better buy. Oftentimes these premiums or rebates are justified by the bussiness and bussiness model. 

In the end like warren buffet says you’re buying ownership in a bussiness not a piece of paper or a balancesheet/indicator. Tesla may be considered overvalued when looking at the metrics but when looking at the bussiness I’d hold shares or buy shares in that company any day. Especially with a 10-20 year time frame.


Point is don’t get caught up too much in the numbers. Yes their important but it’s like the multiple choice section of a quiz. They’re might be a lot of questions but the one long question at the end that in this case is the bussiness model, reigns supreme.
