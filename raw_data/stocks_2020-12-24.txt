 JWN Nordstrom Hello everybody, 

I’ve been holding JWN since June and am currently up 100 %. It’s tempting to sell but I feel like this has more upside than downside. Today, JPMorgan upgraded this and said it’s strongest among its peers which isn’t surprising to me seeing as 57 % of Nordstrom’s revenue is from digital while Kohl’s and Macy’s rely more heavily on foot traffic. All three benefit from less competition (Neiman Marcus and many others are gone). Nordstrom I think is most successful when it comes to omnichannel fulfillment which I believe is going to be a key ingredient in competing with strictly online retailers. I also believe while brick and mortar may continue to struggle that:
1: there will be a boom after Covid is gone because people want to go out and shop using their senses, feeling stuff, look at it, try it on etc especially clothing. 
2: online retailers will actually benefit from also having brick and mortar stores because it’ll help with brand recognition and also curbside pickup which I believe have come to stay - and I think Nordstrom is going to be just that: a mostly online retailer but with some B+M stores around. 

What do you think, is it time to cash in my profit or should I hold for another year or two? 

Thanks in advance for any comments!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do I check my performance this year vs NASDAQ/S&P500? How do I check what my performance is compared to these indices (NASDAQ,DOW,S&P500)??

I know I can check how much those indices are up this year, but surely that cant be a valid comparison? Since that would be assuming that you invested everything on Jan 1st,2020.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 28th, 2020.

# **Stocks ready to close out powerful 2020 as risks loom in January  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/stocks-ready-to-close-out-powerful-2020-as-risks-loom-in-january.html)**
*****
> At the close of trading next Thursday, the bull market will be ready to run into 2021 but probably at a slower pace.
*****
> January is the month that Wall Street tradition says sets the tone for the year — “so goes January, so goes the year,” as the saynig goes. This January could be challenging, with the spreading pandemic slowing the economy and the important Georgia Senate run off elections on Jan. 5.
*****
> On Jan. 20, Joseph Biden will be sworn in as president.
*****
> “It’s a market that’s on end-of-year auto pilot,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. In three of every four years, the market sees an end-of-year Santa rally, but Stovall is also waiting to see trading in the first five days of January for signs of how the market could trade in 2021.
*****
> If the market is higher in the first five days, history shows the S&P 500 has been up 82% of the time for the full year with an average 12.5% gain, he notes.
*****
> “There are things we could worry about in January. If they were real worries, the market would be reacting already or treading water already,” Stovall said. “What spooks me is the market is setting itself up. It’s a correction in search of a catalyst, and we don’t know what the catalyst is just yet.”
*****
> Some strategists expect a pullback early in the year, but the consensus is that the market ends 2021 higher. The average expectation for the S&P 500 at year end 2021 is 4,056, according to a CNBC survey of strategists.
*****
> Stovall said the market has gotten pricey, and there are signs of froth. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 companies is at a 41% premium to the average multiple of 16.7, going back to the year 2000.
*****
> “I don’t feel strongly that the first few days of January has to set the direction for the market for the balance of the year,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “If in fact [stocks] do rally, it’s more of a sign of strength. But if they suffer a hiccup, I wouldn’t throw in the towel.”
*****
> The outcome of the Georgia races is a wild card for stocks, and it could trigger a market reaction no matter what the outcome. Should there be a surprise and Democrats win both seats, the Senate would be split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. That would leave Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to cast the tie-breaking vote.
*****
> Some strategists say the market could sell-off if Democrats win, since investors fear the party would have the votes to pass tax hikes that Biden favors. On the other hand, a GOP win could spark a relief rally.
*****
> But Stovall said the market could rally on a Democratic victory if investors were to consider the prospect for a bigger infrastructure and stimulus package favored by Democrats.
*****
> Arone said uncertainty about the current $900 billion fiscal stimulus package approved by Congress this past week could become a concern, if President Donald Trump decides to veto it or not sign the bill.
*****
> The president criticized the package and said individuals should receive more than the $600 that would go to many adults and children as part of the relief.
*****
> The bill extends aid for millions of Americans on unemployment, and those benefits run out Dec. 31 unless it is signed.
*****
> “We’re up against deadlines, as opposed to it just being a political thing,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “There are actual deadlines on benefits that are expiring. Because of the deadlines, the market assumes it will get passed.”
*****
> But the concern will hang over the market until it is resolved.
*****
> In the four-day holiday week ahead, trading is expected to be quiet. There are few economic reports; jobless claims on Thursday will be watched closely. In the following week, the December jobs report is expected to show a weaker labor market, and some estimate only about 100,000 jobs or fewer were added.
*****
> # 9-month old bull
> The S&P 500 heads into the final week of the year with about a 15% gain for 2020, but from the March low the index is up about 65%. The bull market turned nine months old this past week.
*****
> According to CFRA’s Stovall, that nine-month gain is more than twice the average nine-month gain of 32.2% for all bull markets since World War II. In the remaining course of the bull markets, their average compounded growth was just 20.3%, showing a slowdown in the rate of gains.
*****
> “Following these typical jackrabbit starts, bull market advance rates typically slowed, posting smaller compound annual rates during the remainder of their bull-market runs,” Stovall noted. Based on past bull markets, he said the returns could slow during the rest of this bull run to about half of their current gain.

> # Santa Claus Rally Started Today! First Leg of January Indicator Trifecta

> We have stood on Yale Hirsch’s shoulders and combined his #SantaClausRally (SCR) with his #JanuaryBarometer (JB) and our #FirstFiveDays “Early Warning” System (FFD) to create our “January Indicator Trifecta.”

> Stock Trader’s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch (97 years old and counting!), discovered and named both the “Santa Claus Rally” and the “January Barometer” in 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> The “Santa Claus Rally” began today on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is the first indicator of our “January Indicator Trifecta” for the market in the New Year. Years when the “Santa Claus Rally” (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.

> The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive as shown in table below. In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.

> # Do You Believe In The Santa Claus Rally?

> “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” —Yale Hirsh

> December is widely known as one of the best months of the year for stocks, but most don’t realize that the majority of the gains happen in the second half of the month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Blog-chart-12.23.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Equity strength at this time of the year is widely known as the Santa Claus Rally, but the term is somewhat misunderstood. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real Santa Claus Rally is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official Santa Claus Rally is set to begin Thursday, December 24.

> So how likely are these seven trading days to be higher? Well, there isn’t a single seven-day combo out of the full year that is more likely to be higher than the 77.9% of the time higher we’ve seen previously during the Santa Claus Rally. Additionally, these seven days are up an average of 1.33%, which is the second-best seven-day combo of the year. Do you believe yet?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Blog-chart-2-12.23.20.png?ssl=1))**

> “Why are these seven days so strong?” asked LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Whether optimism over a coming new year, holiday spending, traders on vacation, institutions squaring up their books before the holidays—or the holiday spirit—the bottom line is that bulls tend to believe in Santa.”

> The LPL Chart of the Day illustrates how the Santa Claus Rally has performed over the past 20 years. Usually these seven days are higher, which leads to strength in January. But what stands out to us is that the times Santa didn’t come, January was lower each time. Now do you believe?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-chart-3-12.23.20.jpg?ssl=1))**

> Let’s take a closer look at what happens when things don’t go according to plan. Remember, Yale Hirsch told us, “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” This is because the New York Stock Exchange is at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets.

> Going back to the mid-1990s, there have been only six times Santa failed to show in December. January was lower five of those six times, and the full year had a solid gain only once (in 2016, but a mini-bear market early in the year). “Considering the bear markets of 2000 and 2008 both took place after one of the rare instances that Santa failed to show makes believers out of us. Should this seasonally strong period miss the mark, it could be a warning sign,” explained Santa Claus believer Detrick.

> # Housing Inventories Keep Dropping

> Yesterday's Existing Home Sales data from the National Association of Realtors for the month of November continued to impress. As discussed in last night's Closer, Existing Sales came in at 6.69 million SAAR. Although lower, snapping a streak of five straight months of increases, sales continue to come in at some of the highest levels since 2006. With sales running at such a strong clip recently, inventory numbers have been nothing short of remarkable: there are only 1.32 million listed units nationally with 1.12 million single-family homes listed. Both respective readings are the lowest levels of the past two decades. Even with declines in volumes, the ongoing collapse in inventory levels has driven the number of units in inventory down to 2.37 months' sales (only 2.25 months for single family homes), a new record low. We should note that implied new listings have indeed risen. They stand in the mid-6mm SAAR range, the highest since 2007 but still about 20% below the 8mm range that they hit in the mid-2000s. While prices are still extremely high, they did drop sequentially on the month thanks most likely to a shift in mix towards lower value homes.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just opened an investing account - any advice? Happy holidays to all, 

I just opened an account to start doing stocks. I’m a student and have ~$10,000 excess that I’m willing to put in. I’d say I’m an amateur at best considering my understanding of stocks. 

Any advice would be helpful, whether it be what I should buy or how to determine what I should buy. I’d like to do more long-term than short, however, it doesn’t really matter. 

As well, my second semester starts January and ends April. What stocks should I buy now and sell by then (or continue to hold)? 

Any tips, advice, or suggestions to buy are greatly appreciated. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about carry over loss in 2019 and profit in 2020 Let's say I had 10,000 of losses in 2019. That means I will get a $3,000 write off, leaving me with $7,000 write offs left in losses for 2020. However, I make $7000 in profits in 2020. Would that mean I don't owe any taxes on the $7000 profit since it is canceled out by the $7000 in losses carried over?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I work for CN rail and receive 35% extra buying power directly off my paycheck, should I ever not max this out and invest in anything else? a percentage of my paycheck gets taken off automatically and leaves me with enough that I still have money to save cash each pay on top but not enough to invest in anything else to  a significant  degree. Going at this with a long term view_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ £1000 Christmas I’m 23 and I’ve been investing on Freetrade for around 7/8 months and have recently started on Trading212.

What would you personally do with £1000?

Hope everyone has a good holiday! 🎄

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Baba sucks This is the worst stock I have purchased since dabbling in weed stocks years ago I know it hasn't been a long hold only a few months , but with the CCP set on hurting this company and US hawks in Congress determined to delist and prevent US investment it iust seems like too much to overcome. I am down over two thousand dollars, it might not be that much money but it seems I will not break even for perhaps years and just be left bag holding , should I just sell and take it as sunken cost and buy some Disney or hope it breaks even relatively soon so I can get out of this garbage. I am patient person I lost close to 150k during the March crash and rode it out without panic selling in fact I continued to buy because I was confident in my holdings but baba seems like a lot cause . I had 9k in it down to 7k what are fellow baba holders plans._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Post from the Original ALPP guy. >1,000% gains in a month. Merry Christmas everyone! I first posted about ALPP with some quality DD 29 days ago. Since then the stock price has gone from $.27 to $3.10 a share with an impressive >1,000% gain.  We’ve had  some amazing success over the past month and I hope it was enough to put a few extra presents around your tree this year.

I want to give a special shout-out to u/reecipie for venmoing me $100 (?!!!?!) for giving her the suggestion on my original post. I’ll be donating this directly to charities for battered women and underprivileged kids in my area just to keep the good vibes going.

Congrats to everyone who joined us on this awesome venture. With the new announcement on NASDAQ up-listing and a potential new acquisition before 2021 (as noted by CEO Wilson)...I’m confident this is just the beginning with the gem. I see us scraping $5 in January 2021 and $10 before 2022. These guys are loaded with strategic PR announcements, have increasing revenues and positive cash flow all exacerbated by the ban on DJI drones with the acquisition of Impossible Aerospace. Strap in peeps...just the beginning.

Merry Christmas to ALL!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There are many comments about performing due diligence (DD), but how do you arrive at the correct conclusion? Obviously there’s an emotional and luck factor with stocks which probably cannot be quantified, but if performing an objective DD, two people could arrive at opposite conclusions based on the same data.

How do you “know” which is the correct conclusion, or can you? Unless you are an educated financial analyst, this seems challenging to do for a typical layperson.

As an example, a company could have amazing performance and growth YoY, but one investor could conclude it is unsustainable while another could see it as only a sign of more good things to come. This is a simplistic example and there are potentially other factors like industry, environment, etc. that could drive opinion.

Perhaps there isn’t any one answer to this, in which case I’m curious to see how you all evaluate your DD anyway so I can steal what works for myself. 🙂_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock price predictions for BLNK 2021?? I’m looking to pump and dump, but may stay on it for the entire year. It’s been a wild year for EV stocks, and BLNK shows no signs of slowing down. I’m predicting it will hit 60 by end of January but then massively sell off to 35 right after. Might hop back into TSLA if that happens._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HEXO stock split, what does it mean? I had 50 shares, there was a corporate action Dec 22nd and now I see I have 12.5 shares. There was a stock split. What does this action mean for a holding? Short/long term? 

I bought HEXO as one of my first "intro to stock investing" stocks and I wanted 50 shares (at $1.03ps) to see movement in my portfolio so I'm a little bitter (should I be?) that the number of shares decreased so much. I'm aware stocks below $5 aren't recommended._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wouldn’t the Chinese government want $BABA to be successful? Isn’t in chinas best interest to see a company as big as alibaba keep growing? 

I am very bullish on alibaba, and it’s mainly because I use AliExpress daily and I think they are going to see Amazon like growth in the next few years. Does China just not care?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top 500 Companies Excel Hi everyone,

I just wanted to give my 2 cents for what they are worth for the newer long-term investors.

&#x200B;

**REMINDER: Do not panic sell.  Do not let your emotions influence your decision-making.**  Whether the stock price spikes or dips, take a breath, assess the situation and make a calculated decision.

**TRY to tease out your biases.** For those who think China cares about flexing its power.  You are correct.  However, the perspective from which you are viewing the situation may be biased/primed by the drop in the stock price that you saw.  Try your best to get your mind out of that.  Don't think about the stock price, enjoy your holidays, and on Sunday or Monday morning, whenever you typically spend time to get updated on the news, do that first before looking at the stock price again and make a decision to buy, hold, or sell.

**It's NOT WRONG to SELL.**  At the end of the day, we are all entitled to make our own hypotheses. That's part of the beauty of investing.  It's completely justified if you sold because you were convinced that BABA's global presence will be significantly diminished coming out of this meeting. Or if you made the determination that you would unlikely consider BABA as an investment again.  I just encourage everyone to take a deep breath, take out the emotions, and consider as many neutral factors as possible.

**My PERSONAL thoughts:**  The greatest flex of power is to establish and solidify its global presence and dominance.  Is China really willing to sever relationships with one of its bigger assets just to prove a point?  I personally don't think so.  I think this will be a slap on the wrist for Ma (i.e. "don't speak poorly about us, okay buddy?") to keep him in check.  Even if you wanted to sell because you are uneasy about the politics and cannot stand the volatility, you shouldn't have sold today.  Today was likely an over-reaction to the news.

For those curious, I am holding BABA at a loss, bought a little more today, and it is about 6% of my overall portfolio at an avg. of $259._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA oversold, extreme overreaction BABA Oversold, Don’t sell out of fear

Don’t sell out of panic. Lots of people are panic selling and also selling for end of year tax losses. This will rebound after the holidays. Alibaba is china’s golden child, the entire world looks at Alibaba when it comes to China big tech and lots of Chinese people have pensions in the stock. 

Essentially the dust will settle and Alibaba has said that they will comply with whatever the Chinese Govt wants, which is essentially to allow their sellers to sell on other platforms as well. This will not impact their bottom line going forward and their Q4 earnings are gonna be fantastic. 

I’m personally buying more stock and holding my April $265 options I bought a few weeks ago. Options are down 65% but not worried. At $265 this company was undervalued but at $225 this is like giving free money away. Lots of institutions own BABA and are literally gonna take your shares/options for a discount if you sell.

Just want to see what folks here think about any kind of fallout._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How overrated is Tesla? Let me preface this post by saying I am a beginner in the stock market and unsure if these metrics are supposed to be used like this. Let me know if I am completely missing the boat here.   


Having said that, with Tesla's insane growth rate in the past year, I wanted to make some sense of it and compare it to other automakers and the global vehicle market in general. 

Looking at other brands like [GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/key-statistics?p=GM) and [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F), it appears a healthy P/E ratio for a carmaker is about 20. Similar to any other company, I suppose. 

Tesla is currently at 1312. Given this P/E ratio, I wanted to calculate what earnings needed to be, everything else staying equal. 

Current ratio

* P = 645
* E = \~0.49
* P/E = 1312

A healthy ratio of 20

* P = 645
* E = 32.5
* P/E = \~20

This means that the earnings need to multiply by \~66.3 (32.5/0.49). For the sake of argument, let's assume all Tesla's earnings come from selling cars (I realize this is not completely true). Given that [Tesla sold about 367,000 cars in 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales). They would need to sell 24,332,100 cars to get to that healthy P/E ratio of 20 points (367K \* 66.3). In comparison, in 2019, the total number of vehicles sold globally was about 77.5 million. 

Again I realize Tesla's sales now and in the future will come not only from vehicle sales. But even if they got half their earnings from other products, that still means they need to get to a global market share of \~15%, about 1.5 times more market share than the current leader [(Toyota at 10.24%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)).

What do you guys think of this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The situation with BABA Sorry to be cliche and bring this up yet again but heres my take:

&#x200B;

1) There is definitely more downside. 

\-How much downside? Not sure. But the fact that Jack MA opened his mouth and spoke out about the CCP was a big mistake. Aside from MA, China doesn't want BABA to get so big they can't control it. I think during the course of the probe shares will continue to slump. I wouldn't be surprised if at its lowest it dipped under $190.

&#x200B;

2) I wouldn't buy BABA right now. 

\- There is absolutely no telling what Chinese officials will do to BABA. You may have some idea, but at the end of the day it's the CCP and you cannot predict what they do. Therefore, any investment in BABA (right now) I would consider extremely risky. All it takes is the CCP to announce they are breaking BABA up for shares to sink like the titanic. Is this likely to happen? No. In fact it's unlikely. But from a pure risk perspective there is way too much uncertainty.  I sold my position today. My thought is they will just inject more CCP officials into board positions in the company, giving them more control over it. 

&#x200B;

3) Wait for good news before buying. 

\-Good news being that the investigation has concluded, and that BABA will not be broken up. As the saying goes, don't try to catch a  falling knife. Even if you miss out on that first 5-10% up-spike, you at least wont be averaging into something with a ton of uncertainty that could still tank.    

&#x200B;

Some news about  DKNG, PENN and other stock market news for today.**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! First of all, I wanted to wish to everyone happiness, peace and prosperity this upcoming Christmas, hope you are all doing well, Merry Christmas everyone.

And let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/syhtLB9) leading the way, finishing up .38%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4bcpsq) also barely finishing in the green for the day up .07% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XtPLRkZ) finishing in the red .29%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/1MHj5jB) dropping again today by 3.8% despite being even lower but seeing a pop in the last hours of trading with a spike of more than 4% with more uncertainty being created in the Congress after Trump [vetoed](https://ibb.co/7RpRq4W) the defense bill, as he continued to distract the attention from the big number of [pardons](https://ibb.co/pn5ZGcn) he keeps giving out, with the latest round bringing the total to almost 50 in the past week.

More than 60% of the companies were gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/wB1W5gZ) with over 200 new highs, but the volume was relatively low in this shortened trading week, as 8 of the 11 SP [sectors](https://ibb.co/tDMkjKc) were gaining yesterday with Energy and Financials gaining more than 1.6% with Financials gaining a boost as the [Treasury](https://ibb.co/XFcwxzV) yields pushed up and the curve continues to steepen, while the laggards were Real Estate, Technology and Utilities as value plays especially small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/J3LB8fZ), with the large-cap growth companies finishing the day down by more than half a percent.

You can see this exact thing in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/QJ78SkH) as the 3 biggest companies in the world, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft, finished the day down more than 0.6%. You can also see that most of the gains were concentrated in the banks and oil & gas industry while the rest of the market was pretty much mixed with companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook having small gains, while others like Zoom, Netflix, Airbnb and many more suffered.

Yesterday we also got the AAII [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/phzNq0d) that shows how investors were feeling last week. This time we don’t get any good news as this is a contrarian indicator, as people started to move from a bearish sentiment to a more neutral sentiment with more than 4% of investors moving from a bearish view to a neutral view, with only a .1% increase in bullish investors last week, as the stimulus bill seemed to be finally agreed on before Trump making new headlines this week again with the Veto of the NDAA.

Meanwhile we also got tons of economic data yesterday starting with initial and continuing [jobless](https://ibb.co/bg8K6Dt) claims as initial claims came in way [lower](https://ibb.co/n81QxT6) than expected just over 800K, down almost 90K from the previous week and falling to a 3-week low, with the continuing jobless claims also dropping to 5.3M, lower than last week and what was expected from the analysts.

We also saw the durable goods [number](https://ibb.co/DYN5hkb) coming in better than expected with a .9% increase, up for the 7th straight month, while house [PRICES](https://ibb.co/DKms26p) rose nationwide by 1.5% in October from the previous month, which continued to push house prices higher by more than 10% since last year, with home [SALES](https://ibb.co/xhLcYy5) falling in November but are still up over 20% year over year as the median sales price of new houses continued to trend up.

Alongside this we saw the final consumer sentiment read slipping in [December](https://ibb.co/GV1yS3f) to 80.7, lower than expected but higher than the 76.9 in November, with the November Personal [INCOME](https://ibb.co/0QCHRdN) coming worse than expected, losing 1.1% from the previous month.

In contrast, [today](https://ibb.co/74kjcZD) we don’t really get any critical economic data and the stock market closes early.

So, we saw Nikola take another stumble [yesterday](https://ibb.co/319S2TR), after the whole Apple & Tesla [disruption](https://ibb.co/n897DvD) as we saw the stocks drop more than 10% again yesterday and is down more than 26% since I made my prediction and just hit my first price target, here is the link to that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4l6x3/tesla_news_nio_sales_nikola_stock_crash_stock/).

Nikola shares skid [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zhjQhMq) again after another deal for the company fell, as that meant the termination of the deal with Republic Services to develop an electric garbage truck for them. The deal was expected to have Nikola produce over 2500 trucks for the company. So, I would trim my sell position on Nikola here, while leaving some for my next target, with that target being a drop in the single digits in the future for the company.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/V3JdsFX), we saw Alibaba shares plummeting again more than 8% on the Hong Kong exchange and more than 7% in pre-market in the US by [now](https://ibb.co/7VXxMCC), after more pressure has been put on the company as the Chinese authorities are continuing to pursue anti-monopolistic investigations on the company while also continuing the investigation on Ant Group which is an affiliate of Alibaba as they hold more than 1/3 of the company. I think these investigations are very likely to come out with fines and structural changes on how the company will work with its subsidiaries and affiliates, and that the high flying, record-breaking, Ant Group IPO will likely be postponed for a longer period until they meet regulators requirements as it is expected that Ant Group will be given some guidelines to follow by the [regulators](https://ibb.co/kBm5431). My personal belief is that Alibaba is a great company and it should trade higher than this, but until this whole mess with the authorities clears, anything can happen as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/ssR3Ld6), as the stock has underperformed since Ant Group canceled the IPO, with my long-term price target for Alibaba being 300$, but I wouldn’t go to heavy on this trade right now.

Enough of Alibaba, meanwhile we also saw XL Fleet jumping huge [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MP9XBv2) after the usual short-seller Citron, indicated that there is still more upside for this company.

And one final piece of [news](https://ibb.co/6Zp3qMw) is that Colorado set another record for wagers in November, this is another confirmation of the gambling tailwinds that will skyrocket companies like DraftKings & PENN Gaming higher in the next years.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QvL0MV4) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, while the European Union and UK are finally nearing a deal for [Brexit](https://ibb.co/M9pkZxY), and remember there are only 5 trading sessions left in 2020 with today also being a short-day of trading.

Also, don’t forget this is usually when one of the best 7-day period for gains happens, with an [average](https://ibb.co/QbcDDrh) return of 1.33% and a 77% chance of that happening since 1950. But be careful, not every year is a winner, you can see [here](https://ibb.co/16STGsc) some examples, with 1999 being a very bad year as the dot com bubble approached, with another bad year coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. Hopefully this will be the 5th straight year with a positive return in this period.

Hoping to get some advice on lockup periods 

I have number of stocks which are due to end a lockup period in the future, for example PLTR end of month 

Is it best to sell and buy back in with these Or just hold all the way through if you believe in the fundamentals and long term? 

From the research I’ve done some stocks seem to pump Into the lockup and then have a significant pull back 

Any advice from experience much appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which Tech ETF to buy In the past years I did invest in standard ETF (70 % World and 30 % Emerging Markets). Now I would like to try out ETF and shares that are more focused in certain sectors and technologies. I'm interested in cloud computing, information technology as a whole and clean energy. Many ETF in these sectors had a tremendous growth in the past 12 months. Though that does not guarantee the growth will continue. Still I think that cloud computing and IT has a big potential in the long term as it will get more important. Clean energy could get more important over time as well as more and more countries starting to take the change serious. Not so sure about short to mid term developments though.

I picked following ETF to cover these sectors. Note that I am from Germany and many US based ETF with an US ISIN are not considered as it is more difficult/expensive to get them here and it makes proper taxation more difficult. 

Cloud Computing:  **First Trust Cloud Computing UCITS ETF Acc**

[https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview)

This one covers big players like Amazon, Microsoft, Google. I would like to have them in my portfolio (despite cloud computing being only one of their services) as there will be no way around them in the future probably.

Information Technology:  **Xtrackers MSCI USA Information Technology UCITS ETF 1D** [https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BGQYRS42#overview](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BGQYRS42#overview)

US IT companies with heavy focus on Apple and Microsoft. Involves other companies I'm interested in as Visa, Paypal etc. 

Clean Energy:  **iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF**  

[https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?index=S%2526P%2BGlobal%2BClean%2BEnergy&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00B1XNHC34](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?index=S%2526P%2BGlobal%2BClean%2BEnergy&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00B1XNHC34)

This one had a growth of more than 100 % in the last 12 months. On the other hand it took a giant dive in 2008 and it took until now to recover from it. Might be more risky than the other 2 ETF.

&#x200B;

What do you think about these ETF? Especially for Cloud Computing and IT I'd like to invest in over the next few years but I'm interested in the IT sector and related businesses in general. Maybe adding  sectors in the long term like Blockchain, AI, video game industry etc. On the other hand I'm wondering if I see things to optimistic regarding their growth and importance over the next years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market crash 2.0 I believe it is approaching even sooner than we expected.

Always looking to hear what others think._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why the Alibaba Anti-Trust Probe Should Not Concern You  So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do.

Full disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:

1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company
2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO.
3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company
4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways.
5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.
6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up)

In short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world.

I used the RSI, Stochastic, MACD, Volume Profile, and the 10-50-200EMA Lines.

&#x200B;

**$ACCO:**  New channel that has a new support area which is awesome. Can easily drop to the 50EMA line for a new buy in location. Stoch is oversold.

**$ADC:** Is it a channel, or a triangle? We will see but this is a great buy in price. If it dies, buy in near $62 for easy profit, but can easily run another 10%. 

**$AEP:** Great support area, Stoch and RSI are oversold as well. If it doesn't live go long around $79 for an even better value.

**$AMH:** Very easy to see ascending triangle. Buy in any time now, and it should blast up soon for an easy 7-20%. Riding both EMA lines as well, Stochastic oversold.

**$AMRX:** Showing life at the POC Volume Line. Right above all 3 EMA lines, as well -- so this is an extremely strong support area. Go long for some easy money.

**$AOS:** Channel Up play right at a support. May drop to the 200EMA line though, so it has plenty of buy in areas but this one is very strong to go long.

**$ARCT:** If you like run ups this is a technically sound one. Channel up, 50EMA, support a few dollars away/ Bullish Divergence and Stoch oversold should be a good play.

**$ATO:** What a beautiful deal here, can't get too much lower. Stoch shows Divergence and RSI is actually oversold. Great setup!

**$BTG:** Channeling up, strong support area, and over the 50EMA. It is beautiful set up overall.

**$CGEN:** Ran up like I called, now pulling back, this is a strong support area lined up with the 50EMA line. Stoch is oversold, so it has volume ready to roll.

**$DD:** Simple channel up again, above the 50EMA line, but the Stochastic is very oversold, so it has plenty of room to run. May drop to $63 for a resistance retest though.

**$DOC:** Showing higher lows, and still running. POC Lines is very strong support area, and at a good value. Stoch and RSI almost oversold so we may see it dip just a little more. 

**$DOCU:** Similar to $DOC, it has room to run down as well. Stoch is almost oversold, but this is basically an ascending triangle -- and it has signs of blasting soon!

**$EMP:** Low risk, low reward triangle but could be a very calm 5% to win. Price action is beautiful otherwise.

**$FR:** Ascending Triangle which I love, and it is neat trend line and support area. It has room to run up though, but I think it may take a day or two of red, then it'll take off. 

**$NG:** Support area, mixed with channel up, Stoch over sold showing divergence? Love it go long.

**$OXLC:** Channeling up very well, but may drop to support area near the 200EMA as well. I think it will keep running up, just a matter of when.

**$SXC:** Old trendline resistance becoming a possible support? Love it. Partnered with the 200EMA and support area as well, Stoch oversold and so is RSI, gonna be great!

**$UMH:** Support test here, Stoch oversold as well. If it dies just rebuy in at the channel and go long!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are Apple’s best days behind it?

Reported by Bloomberg. Interested to see how some people view the stock moving forward. Thinking about loading up on some more shares but all the China news scares me a little.

Anyone else watching this one closely?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stay away from IPO's dummies!!! Ben Graham in 1973:
"When the going is good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can't do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn't care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophically enough as "part of the game." Everybody swears off such inexcusable extravagances—until next time."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LSPD - Lightspeed POS - Great Growth Stock, here's what I've learned so far... I bought LSPD in the 30s and now it is 68.36. It's a pretty good return in just half a year. I wanted to share this stock because I think it has amazing upside even going forward. I am listing my reasons why I'm bullish on this stock heading into 2021 below. I wouldn't expect it to double or triple as fast as I made my returns but this over the next 5 years could be a great story. Here are my reasons:

1. This has a market cap of nearly $9 billion it is still a **GROWTH** stock.
2. It's CEO Dax DaSilva has been in charge for over a decade and he's well respected in Canada and totally invested in Lightspeed's potential. He's not going anywhere anytime soon.
3. 40% customer location growth to more than 80k and 51% growth of transaction volume to $21.6 billion growth year over year.
4. 62% year over year revenue growth to $45.5 million and these numbers have held in a pandemic and they expect to do even better post-pandemic.
5. Two MAJOR acquisitions after the latest earnings:

\- ShopKeep acquired for $440 million usd. Serves 20k restaurants in US and Canada which adds 12 billion in annual transactional volume to LSPD

\- Upserve acquired for $430 million usd. Will add additional 7k customer locations and 6 billion in annual transaction volume.

The total annual volume for LSPD will be more than 39 billion overall not accounting for future growth in revenue or volume.

Look guys, a lot of you will think I'm pumping this stock but quite frankly I've already made more money than I ever thought on this.

So I’ll admit I found Wallstreetbets a month ago and I bought THCB because everyone was ranting about it. Basically I bought in at $16 when it was going down and today I noticed it has jumped from its low of $13 to almost $20 in the last week. I can’t find any news explaining the sudden jump and I want to know or be somewhat informed about whether or not I should take my, so far, 21% return or if something is happening I’m not aware of and should hold it longer. Even though I find wallstreetbets hilarious I actually want to be a smart investor that doesn’t yolo their money lol.

EDIT: Thanks for the help. The merger makes sense along with the EV hype and following QS. I personally thought EV was the future long before the hype. I maybe buy more before it continues to jump. I’m young. I can afford the risk.

Continue at this growth or trade sideways ? Or go down? Just curious what people’s opinions are as I am new to investing but growth like this just looks a bit dodgy on the chart haha

So far, I've figured out tape reading is about the amount of bids and asks coming in at what price levels.

It has consistently run up 20-30% every day since then. The problem is that there’s absolutely no news yet. Ive been holding in anticipation of some industry developments but nothing has come up yet.

I’m updating my stop loss every day but I am starting to get spooked that it is going to dive after hours one day and just plummet before I can salvage gains after open. 

It seems like it must be insiders buying up on news that isn’t public yet, but how much advance notice could they have? Is it reasonable to think the news could break a week or more after insiders start blowing up the stock?
