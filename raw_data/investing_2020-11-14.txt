What Happened: Ray Dalio called the current state of global markets a “very special moment,” where the US. economy’s future is uncertain, and China is gaining momentum, Bloomberg reported.

He believes this is because of "rapid development of the Chinese capital markets, the opening up of the markets to foreign investors, the relative attractiveness of them, and the underweightedness of global investors in them.” 

Dalio earlier this month said that he feared the US will experience bigger deficits and have to sell more debt, which would lead to global investors diversifying and, subsequently, investing in China more.

“This is happening when the fundamentals of the U.S. and U.S. dollar are becoming more challenging, making it a relatively competitive place to move one’s capital,” the Bridgewater Associates chairman said. 

Why It Matters: The billionaire previously said he would want to see “a significant portion” of Chinese assets in his company’s portfolio, which already manages $148 billion in assets, “for long-term diversification and shorter-term tactical trading purposes.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'd like to make a question, I hope I don't get destroyed: How can I invest with very low budget?

Apologies for the slightly clickbaity title, I wasn't sure how to best formulate the question.

Let me start by saying that I'm not trying to subtly push my point of view onto others in the form of a question. As an outsider that is currently studying the dynamics of the world of investing with the goal of possibly getting in it in the future, I'm genuinely asking what people more experienced than I think about this.

I very often see people discussing the "true value" of a company. This is usually done, as far as I can tell, using one of a number of stock valuation methods. What some people refer to as "fundamental analysis". I've read my share of articles on [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com) so I think I've got an at least superficial understanding of how this works etc.

However, I find myself wondering *why* this matters at all. On the surface it should be obvious: owning a stock amounts to owning a share of a company, and obviously, you would want to know whether what you are paying reflects the actual value of what you are getting. At the same time, I'd wager that for the majority of people the only real value of owning a stock is the potential gains that can be made when selling it in the future. From this point of view, why does it matter what the "real value" of the company behind the stock is? After all, even assuming I know the "real value" of company X's share is $10, if I have reason to believe I'll be able to sell that share for $200 in a month, buying it now at $100 is a bargain, regardless of how overpriced it is.

Now, if all investors were to religiously follow stock valuation techniques, relying on it for their investing strategy, it would then make sense to use such value as a baseline, because we should then expect the stock's price to stabilise to such value in the long run. I would submit that, even in this scenario, such "real value" of a company would only be relevant for the average investor because other people follow it, not because that's the "true value" that the shares you are buying have for you at any given time, but I guess one can disregard this point as being nitpicky.

But here's the thing: the market, at least at a cursory glance, *does not* look rational to me, and it does not look like many stocks' prices actually reflect their "true value" as derived from fundamental analysis. It mostly seems to me that prices fluctuate due to news stories. Granted, the real financials of a company *do* affect the price, to some degree, but that's because these financials generate a specific type of news story (profits lower/higher than expectations, buy/sell!). 

So all of this brings me to the question: is there any actual empirical evidence that stocks' prices are directly tied to the real companies' valuations, rather than being directly tied to news stories, and thus only *indirectly* to the real valuations? And if so, by what amount? This is the sort of thing that I think isn't very easy to gauge based only on individuals' personal experience (though I'd also be interested in that), so I'm hoping there is some actual statistical analysis that has been performed to assess this sort of thing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Questions before I open an account in Interactive Broker I am an EU citizen living in France.

The Economist this weekend has some great articles on this ([1](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/11/12/value-investing-is-struggling-to-remain-relevant), [2](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/14/does-value-investing-still-work)). I don't really want to push the view that value investing doesn't work anymore; I think that's a red herring. I would love to dig into the idea of "intangible" assets being more valuable, yet also that most investors don't understand them.

I believe my entire investment strategy over the past 8 years has been focused on intangible assets that end up generating large amounts of revenue for companies, but only after years of investment. These include data assets, advertising models fuelled by eyeballs, or enablement of marketplaces (e.g., Shopify, Airbnb, SEA Group, etc.). 

The way I tend to approach intangible investments is to answer "yes" to all of the following questions:

1. Does the company have an effective product that *some* people (i.e., a small current market) consider "best in the market"?
2. If the product moves from *some* people buying it to *most* people buying it, will the company 10x its market cap?
3. Are there current players in the space that are 10x bigger than the company? This shows me that it's possible to displace/disrupt current leaders with a new product and strategy and actually capture a massive market. Think: Netflix in its early days (vs. Blockbuster), think Shopify on its IPO day vs. PayPal, Ebay, etc...
4. Do I believe the management team and founders could execute on this?

There are other signals to look for; if I'm right 1/3 of the time and make 10x on those companies, while losing on everyone else, the portfolio can still 3x itself... Sort of like a VC strategy in public markets. I can write *pages* on this topic, but would rather hear how other people approach intangible investment strategies.

I've been thinking for a while about investing in Japan's railways. For those interested, Japan's railway group (JR Group) provides nearly every train service in Japan. The traded groups are JR West, JR central and JR East. 

Aside from providing the services for public transport, JR Group is an innovator in developing the Shinkansen "bullet trains", well known for consistently breaking land-speed records for up to 600 km/h. This technology, although slow in development, may pave the road for future infrastructures around the world. Furthermore, JR not only provides rail services but also owns the land around the rail tracks. This makes for income with regards to services, real estate, hotel, travel and other businesses.

Right now, all 3 of JR Group's stocks sit around half of their pre-covid values. Before that, they were consistently profitable for every year that came before 2020. They are now posting losses for the first time and it might be a while before they see a return to their normal earnings. 

[https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf)

Posted above is JR West's latest financial report. Although pessimistic in certain regards, the report acknowledges their difficulties and I believe the company itself is under sound management. During the pandemic, they seem to have taken the dip in travels as an opportunity for investing into and expanding their rail infrastructure network. 

The bear in me thinks that the images we have of Japan's conductors stuffing people in trains full of people just so the doors are able to close are over for good. This will likely hurt their profits. Then again, I don't think working from home will take off in Japan as much as it has in the rest of the Western world. Furthermore, a vaccine could cause situations to return to normal in no time. Furthermore, Japan as a whole unfortunately is dealing with a rough economic situation and declining populations. 

The bull in me sees a consistently profitable company that makes great strides in infrastructure technology at a discount of 50%. Japanese train services are head and shoulders above anything in the U.S. or U.K.  and will return to "normal" operation (>80% of their normal commuters) by around early 2022. They have multiple irons in their fire regarding income diversification and I find it unlikely that they will go bankrupt any time soon as replacing a semi-nationalized train service will in many cases be more expensive than subsidizing your current one. 

I'm very interested in those that have anything to add. Thank you for reading through this post.

This asset allocation is based on a combination of Ray Dalio's [All Weather Portfolio](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-library/the-all-weather-strategy/), Chris Cole's [Dragon Portfolio](https://taylorpearson.me/thedragon/), and my own market views and risk preferences. I tried to keep this as simple as possible and not give 50 tickers in each asset class, because it detracts from the passive objective. The other theme you'll see is that there is a place for mutual funds. They're not good for index investing, but they are great vehicles for when active management is needed or when you can't find the right ETF! First read up on the risk parity strategies if you're not familiar, or this post won't be worthwhile. I'm happy to answer questions on my rationale for the different weightings or security selection.

50% Stocks/Cash - includes a global mutual fund with at least 40% exposure to non-US equities, my favorite single-company stock (100 shares to sell covered calls), and two low-cost sector ETFs. Aside from rebalancing, the covered calls are one of the only "active" parts of this portfolio. Keep some of the 50% in cash to dollar-cost-average your buying. Park it in an ultra short term bond ETF like JPST which are usually better than savings accounts. Cash is also another deflation hedge. Dalio's version has at least 30% in stocks. 

25% Bonds - includes a long term treasury ETF (TLT), and a tax free muni bond mutual fund (VNJTX). TIP is an option as well if you want more inflation protection.

10% Commodities Basket - I like BCM, it's an ETN that tracks the bloomberg commodity index. Great inflation hedge and solid exposure to gold as well.  The mutual fund I'd recommend here is EIPCX. 

2.5% Long Volatility - I use VIXM, it's an ETF that buys VIX futures a few months out. I would buy VIX options myself, but I wanted this to be a little more passive. The leverage here allows for a lot less allocation than the 25% exposure in the Dragon Portfolio. If you want a mutual fund to follow Dragon strategy at the full 25%, I'd use AMFAX or similar.

12.5% Bitcoin - The biggest departure from the sample portfolios. I'm bullish on bitcoin as a digital form of gold (all the same benefits), plus I have some gold exposure in the commodity basket.

\- In Norway in October more than 60% of new registered cars were electric   
\- Chinese government emphasises a lot on environment last few years  
\- Those Chinese EVs get good reviews and anticipated on European marked  
\- My guess, Biden will limit trade war with China and make way for green power/EVs

With other words, EV is both present and future. NIO, NIU, XPENG, LI can capture Chinese marked and get a good share European/US marked.

> While visit numbers are lower than what Amwell saw in March and April, he said, they continue to be much higher than before COVID. While officials would not make projections on expected fourth-quarter visits based on COVID, that said the company continues to see increased demand.

> "So many tried telehealth for the first time and so many loved it. Coupled with dramatic changes in reimbursement, we believe that COVID provided a strong tailwind to telehealth adoption and popularity," he said.
