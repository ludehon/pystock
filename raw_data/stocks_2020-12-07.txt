Prop 2: From (1) Yellen will depreciate the USD to support the local US economy, thereby commodities will be repriced higher.

Prop 3: From (1) Countries like China, US, EU need small modular reactor (SMR) \[1\] \[2\] to provide stable electricity when there is no Sun or wind. Countries like India need SMR to replace oil imports, if they want to adhere to the Paris Climate Accord without risking stagflation.

Even Japan is restarting some reactors. Japan must restart many more nuclear reactors to meet the Paris Climate Accord and the 2050 goal.

In fact all countries need SMR to meet their 2050 climate goals because Wind and Solar is insufficient to give them a stable electricity output AND meet future demand on the grid by EVs.

From (2) and (3), Uranium prices will climb as nuclear energy will be considered and marketed as a renewable energy. ie Green nuclear.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk on uranium.

recommend: $CCJ._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are you investing in the LiDAR tech space? LAZR and VLDR outperforming today with huge volume I've been watching Velodyne Lidar for a few weeks now, and with the recent merger for LAZR gaining attention, VLDR seems to be sharing in part of the growth. LAZR closed at +30% today, while VLDR closed at +24% with no news for the latter company. Both had crazy volume today as well. 

I found some good info from an article on investorplace posted today 4pm EST:

>Unlike Luminar and Collective Growth, Velodyne Lidar does not have any big company news. Investors might remember that Velodyne Lidar closed its merger with Graf Industrial back at the end of September. Since then, VLDR stock is up just about 10%. Although that is not necessarily bad performance, it pales in comparison to the post-merger success of Luminar. So then, why is VLDR stock up nearly 22% on Monday?

>Likely, VLDR stock is benefitting from investors once again turning their attention to the world of LiDAR and autonomous vehicles. Additionally, we know that the autonomous vehicle market has been picking up steam. At the start of the pandemic, a lot of research came to a halt. However, now many industry experts see self-driving vehicles as a way to combat the virus. This means that some startups are testing contactless prescription delivery and self-driving robotaxis. It also means that VLDR and its peers look increasingly hot.

Mon, December 7, 2020, 1:10 PM PST

The hot Airbnb and DoorDash initial public offerings due to come this week will use a hybrid auction mechanism that is designed to result in a deal pricing that gets it closer to market pricing. It is intended to address [growing criticism from Silicon Valley](https://www.barrons.com/articles/snowflake-showed-that-ipos-are-broken-heres-how-to-fix-them-51601681326?mod=article_inline) and elsewhere that companies get shortchanged in the IPO process.

With the hybrid auction, institutional investors need to submit through an electronic portal the quantity of stock they are willing to buy and the prices that they are prepared to pay. Such a process was [used in September](https://www.barrons.com/articles/unity-prices-its-ipo-at-52-above-range-now-we-wait-for-the-opening-trade-51600397807?mod=article_inline) as part of the IPO of [Unity Software](https://www.barrons.com/quote/U) (ticker: U), a maker of tools for videogame development. That IPO was led by [Goldman Sachs](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GS).

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Building up a strong portfolio Hi all,

I'm pretty new to the investing game, started out 2 weeks ago with an app called Bux Zero, which was recommended to me as best app in Belgium and is for trading stocks only, with pretty limited amount of stocks to pick from.

It's becoming pretty clear that making substantial profits is not going to be possible when limiting myself to this app alone. Investing in promising, upper coming businesses isnt possible as the app only has the "big name" stocks available.

Can someone explain how did one can really start to build up a strong portfolio, whitout the possibility to trade options or invest in smaller, younger companies? Don't need any specific advice though

The deal is worth $44.4 million and will focus on powering drug reviews and inspections, according to the report.

Co-founded in 2003 by tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, CEO Alex Karp and others, Palantir provides data analytics software and services to government agencies and large companies. But its government work makes up more than half of its revenue, bringing in $163 million in its latest quarter.

The company said in November recent contracts it received during the third quarter include a $91 million deal with the U.S. Army, a $36 million contract with the National Institutes of Health $36 million and a $300 million renewal with an aerospace customer.

Palantir stock has surged nearly 200% since it went public Sept. 30.

I'm trying to come up with a plan for next steps, and thinking of putting in a stop loss order at $26.00 (would stop losses at -10%).  The earnings report doesn't concern me too much.  It looks like they really do have a great product in a market where there is a strong demand, but the threat to delist (even if unlikely) worries me that the stock may have troubles over the short to mid-term.

I'm curious if anyone would be willing to share there thoughts and plans for their NIU holdings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Case for Investing in Huya and DouYu These are two companies I‚Äôm really interested in.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments about them and other Chinese companies and I wanted to address the possibility of delisting and tell you why I‚Äôm still holding shares.

As always, do your own DD and feel free to ask any questions!

# TLDR

* A massive merger between the two major competitors for game streaming in China (Huya and DouYu).
* The merger will be majority owned by Tencent, who are dominant players in the gaming industry with higher earnings than Amazon.
* Independently, Huya and Douyu both have more users than Twitch. Combined, they are predicted to have more than double.
* Delisting is probably not something to worry about.

# Intro

Huya and DouYu are game streaming giants in China, set to merge in the first half of next year effectively giving them a monopoly in China and Southeast Asia.

Individually, the two companies have shown more than impressive growth in recent years.

Huya has drastically increased its revenue by an average of 119% per year over the past three years (yes, on average their revenue has more than doubled every year for the past 3 years). They became profitable last year and currently sit at 7.6% profit margin.

Douyu had similarly incredible revenue growth 110% per year over the same period, also became profitable last year, and sitting at a 8.8% profit margin.

After the merger, the Chinese tech giant Tencent will own 68% of the combined entity.

# But will they be delisted, and does it matter?

First, I want to address the recent news that Chinese companies will have to delist from US exchanges unless they give the US regulated accountants (PCAOB) access to their audited accounts. I don‚Äôt want to talk about the politics and the general implications, only how it affects DouYu and Huya specifically.

Importantly, as of early next year, the two companies are going to merge under the name Huya. This means DouYu will be delisted, regardless of US regulations. If you own DouYu shares at that time, they will be exchanged for Huya shares at a rate of 1 DouYu American depositary shares (ADS) for 0.73 Huya shares (which is very generous at their current prices).

The merged company will be 68% owned by Tencent. Tencent are traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange and over the counter in the US.

Tencent have already increased their share of Huya this year. They purchased shares at $27 per share (Huya is currently trading at $19). It has been suggested that Tencent may buy the remaining 32% of Huya after the merger for as high as $40 per share. If they go through with that, Huya will be delisted and if you own shares you will likely receive a fairly generous payment from Tencent.

This rumour is supported by Tencent‚Äôs refusal to publish synergy numbers. Synergy basically means how much more the merged companies will be worth compared to the two individual companies. Tencent might not publish that data because it will likely drive up the share prices which could force them into a more expensive acquisition.

# Tencent

Tencent are a massive conglomerate whose operating income is larger than Amazon‚Äôs ($18.2B *vs* $14.5B). They‚Äôre a business powerhouse who have invested in no fewer than 185 companies now worth more than $1B each, just since 2000.

They‚Äôre also huge in the gaming industry with full or significant ownership of multiple gaming companies. Their ventures include (but are not limited to):

* Riot Games (League of Legends) - 100%
* Epic Games (Fortnite) - 40%
* Supercell (Clash of Clans) - 84%
* Activision Blizzard - 5%
* Ubisoft - 5%
* Bluehole (PUBG) - 1.5%

# The value of the Huya-DouYu merger

The merger between Huya and DouYu combines two of the world‚Äôs largest game streaming platforms, essentially forming a monopoly in China and Southeast Asia. Combined, they are expected to have well over 300M MAU and own 80% of the eSports market in China.

There is a lot of potential to grow their business and integrate them with the rest of Tencent‚Äôs vast ecosystem.

* They will no longer compete to attract and retain top streamers.
* They will have access to more than a billion users of Tencent‚Äôs WeChat and QQ apps.
* They will have direct access to Tencent‚Äôs gaming megahits such as Fortnite and League of Legends.
* They will be able to tap into massive streams of advertising revenue. As of Q2 2020, advertising only accounted for 5% and 8% of Huya and DouYu‚Äôs revenue.
* Both companies have been testing cloud gaming features that could be fast tracked under the merger. Cloud gaming allows users to run games from the internet without downloading them.

The current CEOs of the individual companies will become joint CEOs of the combined entity. Any cultural or strategic clashes could be a risk factor.

Comparing Huya and DouYu with some of their competitors:

* Huya and DouYu have 173 million and 194 million monthly active users (MAU). Accounting for any overlap, the combined companies are expected to have at least 300 million MAU.
* Twitch has 140 million MAU.
* Bilibili (BILI), a Chinese competitor, recently reported 197 MAU, however Bilibili also operates in areas outside of gaming streaming.
* DouYu and Huya‚Äôs price to sales ratios are 2.7 and 2.8, respectively. Bilibili‚Äôs is 15.2.
* It has been suggested that Tencent may remove streaming rights for some of its games for other streaming companies, effectively giving Huya/DouYu a monopoly across all Tencent games._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla could soar over 300%, to $2,500, in the next three years -- REALLY? >[**Tesla**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) could soar over 300%, to $2,500, in the next three years,

HOLY FUCK!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Need a book recommendation specifically on the real world causes behind how the price of stocks fluctuates up and down Hey r/stocks, 

I know there are a lot of books on investing on the market right now but i am specifically looking for a book that talks about how the price of stocks either goes up or down based on how the economy is. Pretty much i am looking for the real world causes behind the fluctuation of stock prices. 

Like for example, the pandemic caused the entire stock market to crash like crazy but everything eventually went back to normal. Looking for a detailed book that specifically talks about the specific situations that causes the market to go up or down. 

Hopefully my question makes sense, thanks to anyone for any recommendations i can get!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Funny story, I sold my Tesla stocks at 750 (pre split) thinking it was high. Last week I sold again at 540 thinking it was high. Can this even go down? Let's use this post as a discussion! Like the title says, I bought Tesla around 520 pre split. Then it boosted to 750 and I sold it, of course it's profit but seeing it rally to 2000 was kinda sad. Then I bought Tesla again after the split crash. I bought around 330 and sold at 540. Is the same going to happen again? Haha_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you think about $GUSH? I'm trying to understand why it has gone from 80,000 to 40. I had read somewhere its meant to go to zero is that because eventually we won't use oil or for some other reason?

Currently they have a market cap of approx 50b. That means they would have issued close to 2 billion shares. More like 1.7bish.

This seems to be multitudes more than most companies offer in this stage. 

Does anyone know why they offered so many shares or have a guess? And know the implications it will have for the large market cap trading at a low $ amount? Does it have anything to do with direct listing? I could just be interpreting something wrong. Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Invest in Travel?

So,, to me it's tough to buy a stock that has moved around 40% or so in a week, but maybe I'm not appreciating why this is "its time". It's a promising stock, but not any more promising than it was a week ago. I don't see a  strong reopening/vaccine argument here. Was trading in a nice little buy/sell range for a while.

Some expect a boom of 5% aprox in home sales due to rates and so on, which also would mean higher sales from retailers such as LOW and HD. 

Also, atm is lower than even its most pesimistic price: 155. Highest btw is at 210.

So, the outlook seems great, great company, profit margins and the price seems to be a bit undervalued, to say at least. I think this is a buy. 

Please let me know if my thesis is wrong and I am an idiot or if I am quite right._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My grandmother bought me stocks nearly 20 years ago that I'm trying to find again. Can you guys help me find them? When I was about 10, my grandmother bought me stocks in some technology company. My mother and I remember it as two different companies so I'm unsure of what they're actually in. My mother thought it was done through UBS but they don't have an account associated with my ssn. Is there some other way I can look up what stocks are associated with my ssn? I can't seem to find a site that seems trustworthy to do that. I've seen some people in the past getting some help from this sub but I apologize if this was not the place to ask this sort of question._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying IPOs is stupid - here's why So there's often lots of excitement in this sub about hot IPOs and my philosophy is that I usually wait for 6-12 months after the IPO before considering a purchase.  I do that because stocks tend to be very volatile post-IPO, and because I like to see a few quarters of publicly reported financials before deciding if I want to invest.  But I started to get curious about my observations regarding the volatility of stocks after their IPOs, so I decided to conduct a little study.

I looked at some of the largest and most successful IPOs dating all the way back to FB in 2012.  I made a note of the opening trading price on the IPO day as well as the prices 1 month post, 3 months post, 6 months post, 12 months post, and current price.  I included some of 2020's earlier IPOs even though  most of them don't have 6 months of trading yet.  This gave me a sample of 29 IPOs to look at.  All but 2 of them are currently higher than their opening trading price, so it's been a very successful group overall.

**Results:**

10/29 (34.5%) were lower than the IPO price one month later.

6/29 (20.7%) were lower than the IPO price 3 months later.

9/29 (31%) were lower than the IPO price 6 months later.

12/29 (41.4%) were lower than the IPO price 12 months later.

2/29 (6.9%) *never* made a lower low since their IPO.

Two things stand out from this data:

1) There is a clear price pattern in which stocks tend to do better within the first 3 months post IPO but then pull back.  Almost half of them were lower a year later.

2) ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STOCK (27/29) hit a price lower than its IPO price at some point within the first 18 months post IPO (26/27 around the one year mark). 

Now there are a lot of IPOs I didn't include in the study because I wanted to focus on the bigger name stocks to study the phenomenon of buying hot IPOs.  The numbers speak for themselves.  You are much better off waiting a year after an IPO to buy because you will almost always get a better price at some point during that year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Whats up with AMZN and MSFT Most of the tech stocks seem to rise steadily but for AMZN and MSFT.

Why does it feel like I'm getting gaslit with the Chinese delisting stuff? I feel like someone needs to address what's going on or I'm gonna go crazy.

Take Nio for instance (since, lets be honest, that's who most of us care about): they have 3 years to comply with the US PCAOB audit or they get delisted, nice and simple. **Can we all agree that Nio A) likely *wants* to comply with the audit, B) is likely happy to give the PCAOB all necessary access, and C) is likely to *already* be at least almost compliant with the audit internally?**

Those are all things I believe at least. I also believe in the company itself, I think the CEO is great, and all things aside they could be on track to being hugely successful worldwide.

But why is nobody acknowledging or mentioning the chinese government's involvement in all of this? Why isn't anyone mentioning that the audit compliance hinges *entirely* on whether or not the Chinese government (ie, *not NIO*) decides to allow the PCAOB access to the company's data/info? And why is nobody discussing the fact that this would be extremely uncharacteristic for the Chinese government? There are already examples of them sacrificing absolutely *staggering* profits in international markets in the name of control and secrecy (see, Huawei in the US, who would without a doubt be a top telecom company in the US right now if not for the Chinese government).

Can one person provide a response to this that isn't just "stop worrying, they will comply"? I'm not trying to sound like a lunatic about this, but it's just as a genuine fan and believer of Nio I find it extremely frustrating that every discussion I see about this is people covering their ears and saying "they will comply!"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Has anyone else been watching MTRX?

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir‚Äôs ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir‚Äôs Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

‚ÄúOur partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,‚Äù said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. ‚ÄúWe have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.‚Äù

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece‚Äôs rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

Chip engineers at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant are working on several successors to the M1 custom chip, Apple‚Äôs first Mac main processor that debuted in November. If they live up to expectations, they will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans aren‚Äôt yet public. Intel‚Äôs shares slid 1.7% in early trading in New York Monday after the news. Apple shares were little changed.

The road map indicates Apple‚Äôs confidence that it can differentiate its products on the strength of its own engineering and is taking decisive steps to design Intel components out of its devices. The next two lines of Apple chips are also planned to be more ambitious than some industry watchers expected for next year. The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel and to its own silicon in 2022.

While Intel gets less than 10% of its revenue from furnishing Apple with Mac chips, the rest of its PC business is liable to face turbulence if the iPhone maker is able to deliver demonstrably better-performing computers. It could accelerate a shakeup in an industry that has long been dependent on Intel‚Äôs pace of innovation. For Apple, the move sheds that dependency, deepens its distinction from the rest of the PC market and gives it a chance to add to its small, but growing share in PCs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MYOV pending Dec 20 FDA approval MYOV - December 20, pending FDA approval of Relugolix, for prostate cancer (but also uterine fibroids and endometriosis- they entered into an exclusive license agreement w/ Gedeon Richter Plc. to distribute in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States including Russia, Latin America, Australia, and NZ).

Airbnb (ABNB) is a hospitality company focused on disrupting the hotel and travel industry with apartment and house rentals with(out) a host. ABNB has grown since its inception in 2007, ‚ÄúWe have experienced rapid growth since our founding. In 2019, we generated Gross Booking Value (‚ÄúGBV‚Äù) of $38.0 billion, representing growth of 29% from $29.4 billion in 2018, and revenue of $4.8 billion, representing growth of 32% from $3.7 billion in 2018.‚Äù. Now despite taking losses with COVID-19 affecting the two industries they are focused in, they show great prospect with ‚ÄúExperiences‚Äù, financial statements from prior fiscal years, and an expansive market when quarantine restrictions loosen.

\- ABNB has great growth internationally, allowing them to prosper in other countries when the U.S. may not be doing well economically or otherwise. ‚ÄúAs of September 30, 2020, we had over 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of the United States.‚Äù Having 14% of hosts inside the U.S. allows for a possible increase in the U.S. Market, but also shows ABNB‚Äôs resilience with having the majority of hosts international and available when certain countries may experience political issues or economic crises.

ABNB may seem questionable from an American view, but their structure of maintaining security and building trust with guests and hosts is a centerpoint to ABNB‚Äôs success. ‚ÄúOur host protections include property damage protection and liability coverage. In addition, our trust and safety initiatives include risk scoring, watchlist and background checks, fraud and scam prevention, secure messaging, secure payments, and minimum age requirements.‚Äù ABNB must be able to maintain this trust, which can easily shift with the media and lawsuits they are battling at the moment as mentioned further in their IPO under Risk Factors. The risk that actions taken by the hosts, guests, or a third-party involving crime or vice can undermine the reputation of ABNB should be a reminder that ABNB can be fragile and is built around trust, not results.

ABNB addresses their possible market, saying, ‚ÄúWe have a substantial market opportunity in the growing travel market and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market (‚ÄúSAM‚Äù) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for short-term stays and $239 billion for experiences. We estimate our total addressable market (‚ÄúTAM‚Äù) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences.‚Äù This is a large market for long-term growth that they can capitalize on once a vaccine for COVID-19 is approved and distributed, catalyzing travel and hospitality.

Acknowledgement of competition is very thorough, noting not only ABNB‚Äôs competitors in the travel industry, but the hospitality industry as well. Various competing agencies along with their properties can significantly impact the success of Airbnb, depending on who attracts more guests in the long term.‚ÄúOnline travel agencies (‚ÄúOTAs‚Äù), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands [Booking.com](https://booking.com/), KAYAK, [Priceline.com](https://priceline.com/), and [Agoda.com](https://agoda.com/)); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/), Orbitz, and Travelocity); [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) Group (including the brands [Ctrip.com](https://ctrip.com/), [Trip.com](https://trip.com/), Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba) Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs;‚Äù The Chinese market is also noted as major competition. Despite the majority of revenue and earnings from EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), the Chinese market is one that could have positive benefits for ABNB‚Äôs reach on the global scale. More competition includes the hospitality sector with ‚ÄúHotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels; Chinese short-term rental competitors, such as Tujia, Meituan B&B, and Xiaozhu; and Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, and KKDay.‚Äù ABNB is battling two different fronts and it can be important to consider their role and presence in both. Hurting the hospitality sector and negatively impact their travel sector as well.

Another significant risk factor noted was natural disasters. Homes that are affected by natural disasters can decrease the supply of hosts available in various countries. This decrease in supply can leave ABNB struggling to retain guests and can negatively affect revenue.

In conjunction with ABNB‚Äôs international reach, they noted that their revenues could be negatively affected by foreign exchange rates. ‚ÄúFor the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 60% and 50% of our revenue, respectively, was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated.‚Äù The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar can harm their profits and could create financial difficulties in the future.

Supply and Demand are both important when considering a company‚Äôs product. Looking at consumer demand, we see an increase even during the pandemic with ‚ÄúApproximately 76% of active listings had been booked in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and 90% had been booked in the 24-month period ended September 30, 2020.‚Äù ABNB has a growing niche for hosting and we can expect this demand to grow after the pandemic as well as more people begin to travel abroad again and may not consider a public hotel.

Experiences were briefly mentioned, ABNB hosting experiences including cooking lessons, virtual activities, and virtual animal visits. There is minimal data and research on Experiences‚Äô growth and valuation, but could be seen as a giant gap to purchase another company or grow.

Financial Summary:

Key Takeaways:

We have seen aggressive growth in product development over the past three years and then averaging around $690 million. Sales and marketing have also increased with over $1 billion, increasing their range of guests and hosts. Although we did see a dropoff in this expense, part of the decrease can be accounted for by the effects of COVID-19. Looking at Total Cost and Expenses, the largest sum was in 2019. ABNB‚Äôs filing for 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30 shows a decrease in these expenses. This can be because of a decrease in demand so a decrease in spending, but also shows that they are able to handle debt and can cut down on these expenses if necessary.

Key Takeaways:

Total assets are greater than total liabilities. However, we have seen a spike in liabilities in the last column, an increase of about $1 billion. Working capital is hovering between $1 and $2 billion. Cash and other equivalents are stronger from prior years, increasing cash in the final column, showing budget cuts ABNB has made to survive the pandemic.

The increase in Bookings year over year shows the growth of the industry and the potential it has to offer, increasing dramatically since 2015 and maintaining this solid growth.

The increase in free cash flow also supports this growing company. We do see a sharp decline in cash flow during 2019, but note that expenses also increased that year in the financial statement.

Despite the decrease in both domestic and international travel, domestic travel has rebounded significantly, showing the flexibility ABNB offers even during difficult housing times.

Most bookings are under 1 month; however, there are consistent bookings of more than 1 month stays, asking the question, is there a more viable option to rent long-term in a different area?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on Blackberry?

Is this anything close to a good buy? Or is it just another meme stock?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ December 2020 (prediction/news) My opinion on the market and stocks I see value in if your thinking of investing in any of these do further research :)

**Covid- 19 Vaccine**

As of 12/6/2020 ABC News announced that vaccine could be authorized in days depending on how the hearing plays out. Right now Moderna and Pfizer are leading the race to get vaccines out. Although News sources are saying the general public (or the people who affect stock prices) probably will not receive their vaccine until Spring or Summer 2021. Spring 2021 seems more likely just based on the fact that there are several other companies also nearing the finish line for a vaccine. I think the vaccine will take a while to actually be effective as far as vacation travel, entertainment, and etc goes, because Carona Virus has now been around for almost a year. Every single person's life changed so when this vaccine does come out and is distributed I wouldn't expect everything to just change like the world is on a light switch. Hopefully by this time next year most industries are back on track but we will see.

&#x200B;

**Airlines**

Only really speaking on AC and Spirit which both have had massive gains since Pfizer's announcement several weeks ago. Spirit is up 20% in the last 30 days and AC is up 37%, hopefully, both push further this week, which they should if the FDA authorizes a Vaccine this week. Personally, I think Air Canada is a strong stock to invest in because it's Canada's only Airline and it holds a big stake in Canada's entire economy because of the number of jobs the company provides. Last week Air Canada told the press they are getting into transporting more cargo. This could help start to pay off their massive amounts of debt. Although they also bought several new fuel efficient passenger planes as well. The only reason I think it's a strong investment is that it'd take a lot to see AC go bankrupt based on where they are at now and the ROI is one of the biggest in the industry if the stock goes back to pre-covid numbers. Obviously, bankruptcy happened before but Canada's government bailed them out. Motley Fool has posted several times in the past 2 weeks that AC is going to crash but "you should buy it when it does". Only thing is, it still hasn't crashed, last week they released their prediction of the stock crashing as well as 7 hours ago, yet AC is up 13 percent in the past 5 days. Spirit looks promising as well with there 1.95B of cash on hand they can last this pandemic for quite a bit longer. I think both AC and Spirit are going to take at least another 2 years to fully recover but eventually, I believe we will see the day.

&#x200B;

**Entertainment**

In my opinion, it's almost too late, should have bought the companies with the biggest cash reserve months ago. Gambling and concerts are almost too high at this point to make the ROI worth it (specifically MGM and Live Nation).  Cruises don't really seem worth considering the amount of time it will take for them to come back and honestly I don't really see as many people booking cruises anymore. They are known for the idea of "when one person on the boat gets sick, the whole boat gets sick", I don't know if it's just me but that doesn't make me wanna book a cruise for several thousand dollars. Yeah, the stock will probably increase over time but almost every company retired several ships during this pandemic. That tells me one thing; the cruise industry already knows they will not be doing as well as they had for a very long time. On to movie theater, my 3 words of advice "do not buy". Warner announced last week all of their films in 2021 will be going directly to streaming as well as theaters and most likely many companies will fall in their footsteps. This pretty much means everyone will be watching premiers from their living room and will only be paying the streaming service fee, and can bring whatever snacks they would like without shoving a box of Milk Duds down their pants.

&#x200B;

**EV**

Only speaking on Tesla and Fisker (Ticker FSR). Tesla is a good investment if you can afford to buy a substantial quantity. There is a lot more potential for the already huge company. Tesla finally announced a more affordable car that starts at $25,000, this could definitely take Tesla to the next level just because it seems like everyone wants a Tesla until they start shopping for it (at least in California). The reason I bring up Fisker is because of their lease program, they have the 2022 Ocean coming out in the spring of 2022 that starts at $2,999 down and a $379 a month payment and comes with the ability to drive the. car 30,000 miles per year. Which completely differs them from Tesla considering Tesla's leases are much more and they come with like 9,000-12,000 miles. The only thing about this company is that it's quite a gamble, this is their third try at a car. While Obama was in office they lost all the stimulus money given by Obama to support the EV industry. It's definitely an investment that could pay off (higher the risk = higher the return) so let's just hope everything goes as well as they make it look. The third time the charm. Right?

Airbnb is boosting the range to between $56 and $60 a share, from $44 to $50, people familiar with the matter said. The new range would give the home-rental company a valuation of as much as $42 billion on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.

DoorDash Inc., the food-delivery company that is expected to debut Wednesday, the day before Airbnb, plans to price its shares at the high end of or above its range of $90 to $95 a share‚Äîalready raised from between $75 and $85, people familiar with the offering said. That would give the San Francisco company, the largest among its peers, a valuation of as much as $36 billion or more, on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.

Taken together, the developments are the latest sign that the market for new issues, already at a record in terms of money raised in the U.S., is set for a climactic ending to the year. The market has been buoyed by soaring stocks, including those that have recently made their own debuts.

So far this year, more than $140 billion has been raised in initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record high set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that dates back to 1995.

Valuations of both Airbnb and DoorDash have been boosted after roughly a week of investor meetings known as roadshows.

December is typically a quiet time in the IPO market. This year there will instead be a flurry of offerings. In addition to Airbnb and DoorDash, videogame company Roblox Corp. and the parent of online retailer Wish, ContextLogic Inc., are expected to debut before the year is through.

For companies now, including Airbnb and DoorDash, roadshows have been conducted differently than they would have in the pre-Covid-19 world. Executives have been marketing their offerings to mutual funds and hedge funds in Zoom meetings rather than in the typical whirlwind tour across the country.

Both Airbnb and DoorDash and their respective underwriters will set their final IPO prices in the coming days. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are leading Airbnb‚Äôs IPO, while Goldman and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading DoorDash‚Äôs.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PFIZER Pfizer has been a good talk this past weekend with Canada almost approving the vaccine. Do you guys recommend buying Pfizer right now or wait until they take a dip (if that happens)? Looked into Yahoo Finances and it's stated as "overvalued" right now... Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is reddit thinking this week? Over at r/reddittickers we have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 ‚Äì 12/5.  For Friday‚Äôs expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF‚Äôs such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index‚Äôs year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday‚Äôs close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 ‚Äì 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 ‚Äì 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

If you are interested in the full dataset I could potentially post it somewhere._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Recommended research (data) sites Could anybody recommend a good site (free or a reasonable charge for a newbie investor) that they use to review data on stocks, ideally so it covers the US and UK markets (Canada and Australasia as a bonus)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Growth stock under $100 and around 20 billion MC Hey

I am trying to find a new growth stock to invest in. I know the market is at an all-time high, but just doing research at this point.

Is there a great growth stock that I should know about that is:

\- Under 100$ share price (is important for my option strategy and because of limited funds)

\- Ideally under 20 billion market cap.

I like ETSY but it's to expensive. CHWY is another one I like. I mainly look into tech, so maybe there's an other industry I am missing out on.

The stock market is a rigged casino on crack + short liquidations + momentum bots + free corporate money at 0% apr. People are blindly following Buffets lead and I hope it ends in tears for everyone involved at Berkshire.

Its as if Buffet and the boomers have invested in a shell company called SNOWFLAKE to rub it in the millennials face even more during one of the most chaotic periods of the last 50 years.  The market valuations are a complete joke with Covid still rampant, government shutting down small business, and people locked in their homes fearing for their life.

What the hell is going on? Is the corruption not obvious yet?

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on the Renaissance IPO ETF (Ticker: $IPO) which buys into new IPOs? Looking for some insight from anyone familiar with this ETF as it's definitely piqued my interest. According to the website:

>You will have exposure to the most significant newly public U.S. listed companies in a portfolio, prior to their inclusion in core U.S. equity indices.

>How it Works. The ETF tracks the rules based Renaissance IPO Index, which adds sizeable new companies on a fast entry basis and the rest upon scheduled quarterly reviews. Companies that have been public for two years are removed at the next quarterly review.

The MER is 0.60% and returns have been phenomenal this year. If they'll be investing in upcoming IPOs such as ABNB, RBLX, etc this seems like a good buy. It's consistently beaten the S&P500 despite being 86% large cap, 14% mid cap according to their facts sheet. I haven't bought any yet, just looking for opinions. Especially if anyone looked into this ETF and decided not to buy in, why exactly? Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ High Growth Rate Psychedelic Stock Tickers. Hi All,

The last post I created was six days ago when Cybin was at $0.64 USD and MMED was around $1.59 range.  Cybin is now at $0.97, and MMED is at $1.89.  Since my last post [Click Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3mmic/psychedelic_stocks_new_green_rush_mmed_cbyn_cmps/) I have gotten lots of interest asking me how to buy these stocks.

Both of the tickers can be bought on CAD or US exchanges.  However they are not on all brokers, you would need to find out yourself. The tickers are following:

**Mindmed**
US: MMEDF
CAD: MMED

**Cybin**
US: CLXPF
CAD: CYBN

The only Psychedelic stock that is on NASDAQ is Compass Pathways CMPS, which is at $49 per share.  MMED is going to up list on Nasdaq, and for this to happen the minimum share price must be $2.00 per share for few days to get approval for uplisting.

I also see MindMed hitting two times higher market cap then CMPS, which might be the best growth stock opportunity to buy right now. I also see Cybin hitting close to 500 million market share by end of next month (3x growth in SP from current SP opportunity)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the best and worst stock you ever owned?
