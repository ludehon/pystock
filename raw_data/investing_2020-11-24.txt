 How do we feel about Shopify? I've been holding Shopify since it traded at $219. It's ran up 450%+ since then, and while I still love the company, and believe in their product, it's hard to ignore such incredible growth, and I wonder if it's going to trade flat for a while.

Certainly the growth they saw last quarter was accentuated by COVID, but I think a lot of the transition from brick and mortar to online storefronts is permanent, and won't go back even after COVID is under more control.

Is Shopify a HOLD, BUY, or SELL, in your opinions? Is the company deploying its cash well to continue their growth and improve their product, or are they just hoping to increase market penetration with their current product?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV Related Stocks Hey everyone I’m a fairly new investor.

Unfortunately bank rates are close to 0% so you are effectively losing money to inflation by keeping them there. At the same time the stock market indexes have sharply departed from measured GDP. Assume I am sufficiently invested in these stock indexes. Assume I am also not interested in investing directly in physical assets (gold, silver, real estate, etc). I am just looking for a happy medium of return (\~3%) between the 0% savings rate and the 14%+ (but volatile) stock indexes to be invested over a 2-3 year timeframe.

Anything work well as an alternative to balance out a portfolio? Bond index ETFs (BND, BNDX, BIV) seem to be the best bet but they are a bit inflated as well and suffer from some of the same issues/exposure as the stock indexes.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CMV: The technology sector is not overvalued - the tech industry is revolutionizing society, investing included. I don't understand why technology is viewed as overvalued.

Tech's ascension last decade was pretty unprecedented. Yes, there was the dot com bubble, but I'm not sure if it is entirely comparable to now, given that computer technology has invaded every aspect of everyday life now. Social media is destabilizing third world governments and disrupting the political discourse of developed nations; amazon is putting malls out of business across the world; computers are making entire industries irrelevant to the point we have reached the real possibility of needing UBI; and smart phones are the modern swiss army knife of the information age with access to almost all knowledge and people on our globe from one or two swipes. 

People always say "well but historically blah blah blah" and "well but fundamentals say this..."

I thought that the only truth about investing was that there are no guarantees, and that going off of history is irrelevant looking forward? What does it matter how things in the 20th century performed? Netflix Facebook and whatever might not exist to the extent they are now in 10 years but to say that technology won't continue to be revolutionizing society is somewhat absurd to me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinion - Biotech is going to skyrocket in upcoming years.

This is going to be my first post, I feel it's necessary because I'm in a bit of a tricky situation regarding the purchase of shares of a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company).

I've been bagholding shares of GMHI (Gores Metropolous Inc, the SPAC) for a while now. The proposed merger will bring Luminar (a private company pursuing to take a shot at a (large) piece of the global market share on LIDAR-technology for autonomous vehicles) public under a new Tickr 'LAZR'. 

My question is the following: The proposed merger has a fixed valuation before (attempting) to going public, and they are issuing shares to the public and keeping some shares private. To my knowledge, this would mean they have a fixed share price when the merger goes through (Approx. 10 USD/Share if I'm not mistaken).

However, the SPAC is trading +- 36% higher than this at the moment. The company has stated that all outstanding shares of GMHI will be turned into a 1:1 equivalent amount of shares for LAZR. **If the merger goes through, does this mean that when the original TICKR (GMHI) turns into LAZR, the value of the shares would possibly decrease to 10 USD/Share (even though I bought in at 12.5USD/Share of GMHI)?** 

Or does the market value of the GMHI shares carry over to the new TICKR? 

To me it's obviously important whether or not I should sell my shares pre-merger to buy in at a lower price point, or will market sentiment 'most likely' correct the new share price of LAZR?

I used to work as a contractor at GM, and between the two, I definitely have more trust in Ford to be a stable investment. Part of my faith in Ford comes from the fact that they worked themselves out of debt without the help of the federal government, unlike GM. Another reason is because, during my time working as a contractor, I noticed that the entirety of GM management that I came across seemed to believe that the trucks they were producing essentially rendered their Cameros, Corvettes and other luxury vehicles nearly obsolete in the market, because the trucks offered all the luxury features and the added utility that a big vehicle naturally brings. 

For reasons I couldn't quite grasp, they continued to produce vehicles which they believed were undermined by one of their own products and which they didn't seem to have faith in, in terms of selling power. Ford, meanwhile, seems to have focused on trucks first and foremost, which, as GM seems to believe, have superior market potential for the aforementioned reasons. GM seems committed to production of luxury vehicles for reasons other than simple supply and demand motivations. I heard some say part of it was the tradition and the association between product and brand. I'm not sure, but the fact that I couldn't understand their rationale makes me skeptical of ever looking to them as a stable investment. Ford, from what I can tell, seems to understand their niche and their limitations and seems willing to operate within them, whereas GM seems to be banking the prestige of their vehicles making up for the lack of popular demand for them; maybe they think they are going to experience another Transformers.

I am not an expert on either company, these are just my two cents.

Hello  everyone, just wanna give you the heads up that I am fairly new to  this. I make my own DD before investing in a company but I have no way  to know if my DD is good until after the fact. So, I had this idea of  posting it here and the community can discuss the ticker and my DD. I am  hoping that I you guys can pick-up on any mistakes that I am not aware  of.

All the data was collected from MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha and YahooFinance.

So, Element Solutions (**$ESI**)  is a specialty chemicals production corporation formerly known as   Platform Specialty Products Corporation (changed the name in 2019). They  own several business brands: MacDermid, Compugraphics, Fernox, alpha  and Kester.

The company does business all over the world (EUA, South America, Europe, Asia) and has reach to a many key markets:

* Automotive
* Computing & Telecom
* Consumer Goods
* Energy & Resources
* Military, Aerospacial & Medical
* Mobile & Wearables
* Printed Packing
* Water Treatment

I won't go over them in detail, just a few key point:

**Automotive**

According to their website, their automotive initiative ESI:Automotive includes **EV/Powertrain**, **Safety systems (ADAS)**, Lightweight, Interior and Exterior.

Their EV/Powertrain business is directed at Battery management systems and inverter solutions.

The Safety systems (ADAS) include sensors, cameras, **Lidar**, central computer and conectivity.

The remaining divisions are mainly for improved materials, displays, touchscreens, etc.

Also according to them the ESI:automotive has **more than 1400 active patents**.

**Computing & Telecom**

They throw a lot of big words around: Big data, AI, 5G... but **at the end of the day they supply the materials** to build and operate those systems. Which is fine.

"Specifically developed materials that are utilized in many of the  highest technology processors today."

"High-performance assembly  materials and solders are the conduit of electronic functionality."

**Consumer Goods**

As more to do with **aesthetic** and surface solutions, coatings, etc.

**Energy & Resources**

They deal with oil companies and **solar** companies.

"The  offshore oil industry uses our control fluids to effectively and   safely recover oil from the deepest depths. The photovoltaics industry   utilizes our chemicals and materials to conduct new electrons as soon as   they are created within solar cells."

**Military, Aerospacial & Medical**

Coatings/shock  absorbers for airplanes, circuit metallization and high integrity  solders connections for military aplications, semiconductor packaging  methods for circuits in medical imaging devices and chemicals that form  the circuity of medical eletronics.

**Mobile & Wearebles**

"Our printed electronics initiative is helping companies to explore the  **printed electronics market**  with our combined product and application  experience spanning circuit  metallization, assembly and soldering,  precision coated films, and  printed graphics. We represent a strong and  organized front in this new  and exciting industry, and are looking  forward to shaping its  development in the decades to come."

Again they throw around big words like 5G, Cloud, streaming,  extended battery life, etc...

**Printed Packaging**

This area is all about printing those nice, vibrant and appealing packages that catch your eye at the supermarket.

"In the graphics packaging industry, we are a leader in innovation. With **global patents and trademarks**,  our research and development drives  flexographic printing forward.  Printers turn to us to ensure the  expectations and demands of brand  owners are met for every print job  they deliver."

**Water treatment**

**Manufacture and supply of chemical and filter technology** to diagnose, treat  and protect domestic and commercial heating systems in **markets across  the globe**.

"Many  of our products are award winning and are accredited with  independent  approvals for their energy efficient and environmentally  friendly  credentials."

All  in all, this seems like a company that has their fingers in a lot of  markets. Some are still growing (EV, Solar energy, semiconductors) and  other are more well established (Water treatment, printing packages,  Medical) which in my opinion gives them the oportunity to grow and have a  nice fail safe cushen if things go south.

**The numbers**

&#x200B;

|Year|2018|2019|TTM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|1,96 B|1,84 B|1,78 B|
|Net Income|(81,5) M|78,9 M|121,2 M|
|EBITDA|411,5 M|400,5 M|390,4 M|

&#x200B;

**Market Cap:** 3.34 B             //                              **Free Cash Flow (2019):** 100.7 M

**P/E:** 29.39

**EPS:** 0.48

All  in all, I like these numbers. There might be no substancial growth  going on right now, but as the company pointed out in their last  earnings, COVID took a tool on their clients, and business has not  increased as expected. Nontheless they managed to increase their Net  Income (TTM) and maintin a health EBITDA.

In the coming period, as governments crackdown on greenhouse gas production, they will need companies to be net carbon neutral. As the companies strive to reduce the carbon production, they will have a period of needing to purchase carbon credits to offset the current levels of production.

In this realm lays the carbon credits. To offset the current levels of games produced, they buy carbon credits.

Now I'm not sure how consumers/traders can invest in carbon credits. There is one ETF that i found KRBN which allows such.

In addition, this demonstrates that investors can use this information in order to make accurate predictions about the return on investment and to implement good trading strategies based on sentiment analysis, doing, on average, much better than traditional investment strategies such as Buy and Hold or Moving Averages (5 -20 periods).

These results appear to be statistically and economically significant. Theory that suggests a link between retail investor behaviour and stock market performance is now supported by this.

Not sure if this has been discussed before or not. Overall, I can see 2 major issues with people actively investing in the stock market and that the number of people doing so has increased (drastically?) this year.

1. Inflated prices. 
Okay everyone knows this. Too many people buying something that's limited in quantity will push it's price up. No biggie.

2. No real increase in disposable income.
This seems to be a really big problem. It's not like people have gotten richer or have a bigger pay check now. This means that people are saving money and investing that.

Why is that a concern?

Because if so many people are cutting down on expenses to invest the surplus, consumerism will go down. If people are putting off buying a new smartphone, a new car, make upgrades to their homes to save money and invest, it is going to hurt the associated business. A lot. Which means their earnings will go.

Boom!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Analysis of the Key Distruptors in the EV & Automotive Industry Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM.

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the "old boys club" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often.

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago.

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in.

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China.

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get.

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!

https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment choices intra/post COVID Hi everyone, I hope this post is OK to post here but just wanted to put my thoughts down in a thread and see if anyone can give their insight/opinion as to whether my thinking is as simple as this. I am aware many outcomes can come from the current climate, none of which can be predicted, but I am looking for your thoughts based on the next 18 months going as such:

(note: I am from the UK, but I think it applies similarly to US/EU investment too)

January 2021-June 2021: Vaccination of Elderly   
June 2021-Dec 2021: Vaccination of second/third "at risk"   
Jan 2022-June 2022: Back to "Normal" (vaccinations required)

**At the moment** I see a couple investments as very attractive. Recovery stocks in the short term and Gold/Silver in the middle term. Long term is too far away for me to consider right now. My thinking is that recovery stocks (mostly travel related) are very underpriced right now. I'm up 10% just this week from them and most of them will have to increase by 300-500% to get back to pre-pandemic levels. My thinking is that once vaccination becomes a reality, all the pent up demand for airlines/cruises and the like will surge these stocks to (or given stocks can be hype-fuelled) or further than their pre-pandemic levels. I personally am pushing for many over 50s cruise lines as I expect them to be the first to re-open given the first phase of vaccination is of that demographic. I expect stocks to soar in travel in 2021, but would be intrigued to hear all your opinions on this. I also personally think property may be a good options mid 2021 in the UK as IR's will still be very low and the bubble will have popped by April 2021 (no explanation needed there lol)

Now, I think what's next? I read last week that UK banks are experiencing record high levels of savings. People aren't spending as much as they were. The problems with the travel industry is they have reduced capital, grounded so many planes and logistically it will be a nightmare to match even pre-pandemic demand. Their supply is going to be drastically cut shorter, but demand will be massively higher. I think people will justify paying more than they were used to out of desperation and their savings account balance justifying it. What does this do? Increases prices and surges inflation. This is good for the government as they don't have to increase taxes as much given the debt proportionately decreases and it's good for those companies as they can recover quicker. It's not good for the average person who has a savings account still at the 0.5% interest rate. Yes, eventually the gov will raise IR's when inflation becomes unstable, but until then, what do we do as investors? That's where I'm going to position into gold (and a bit of silver).. at LEAST until IR's come up. 

My strategy to conclude is as follows:

**Short Term:** Recovery stocks (very under-priced)  
**Short/Mid Term:** Property (IR Low / Prices Low)   
**Mid - Term:** Gold (Inflation)  
Note: I hold other investments so am diversified, but wanted to share my bullish views.

Do I believe it reduces transmission? Absolutely, yes.

I bought 50 shares of Corsair at $17.45, then another 227 between that and $30.It accrues for roughly 60% of my individual stocks in my portfolio, with the rest being somewhat diverse.

My question to you is - would you sell now if you were to gain 74%? I originally planned on selling at $40, but the way it keeps rising, I was thinking of holding until $50 then selling 50-75%. This is my first IPO that hasn't bit me in the ass, and I am quite pleased with the result. 

The company is solid, holidays are on the way, it is THE gamer/streamer company which every kid wants to do nowadays, so I think the "normal" price will be between $50-60 when it finally settles down. Logitech will probably remain worth more, but people spend stupid amounts of money on RGB (like me) and capture cards.
