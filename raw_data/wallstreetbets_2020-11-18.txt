Honestly don't know if this is DD or not.

I have 1-3 contract positions in half of them just to ignore.

MGM at this time is overvalued, lets be real here. COVID is not going away anytime soon in fact the rate of infection in Clark county is skyrocketing. Wildfires are burning through Nevada which means people are losing their homes. In return people are forced to move in with friends and families or even worse they are forced into public shelter. This is increasing the rate of infection.  They are running out of ICU's and even the govenor of nevada got COVID. The govenor himself said he is thinking of taking drastic measures to protect the state of Nevada from COVID. Non essential buisnesses will shut down in the vegas area, casinos are non essential. When the govenor announces  the shut down it will have a negative effect on the stock as the majority of cash flow for the company comes from the mature Las Vegas region. MGM already closed their casinos in detroit and I believe vegas is next. Also, the holiday season is here which is also going to drive up the coronavirus rate. I am a college student and morons here are partying like nothing is wrong. They are going back home in a week and I believe will drive up COVID even more. If I had the money(BROKE IN DEBT COLLEGE STUDENT PAYING OFF MEDICAL BILLS AND TAKING CARE OF SIBLINGS) I would buy puts on MGM but please don't take my advice because I am a rookie and could be totally wrong. Just want people's opinions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What am I missing with vertical spreads? It shows I can buy a deep ITM call ($460 strike) and sell a deep ITM ($465 strike) call for TSLA expiring in 2 days for $350. Let it expire and collect an easy $150? If this works then I am going to buy 10 contracts and make $1,500 Friday.

/r/options deleted my post for asking this so thanks /r/options for being so helpful.

*Edit - If TSLA closes at 500 Friday, will TD Ameritrade automatically exercise my options then immediately call them away on the short leg ($465) - so no need for $46,000 in my account if I buy one contract?

Thanks elon. 69,696.68 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PCG Gang to the fucking moon. The final PCG DD that literally cant go tits up In case you missed my earth shattering DD from a few months ago, ill link it here and give you a recap.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ho78zs/what\_in\_the\_actual\_fuck\_is\_pcg\_doing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ho78zs/what_in_the_actual_fuck_is_pcg_doing/)

To summarize, PCG is the largest utility company in the united states, who finalized and exited chapter 11 bankruptcy in july, settled their fire victims trust lawsuits fromthe previous years of just burning everything alive, and now they are a part of a 20 BILLION dollar insurance fund for future wildfires.

The fire victims trust agreement, which was a part of their bankruptcy exit agreement that was approved in early July, had a 90 day lockout period. Besides cash to the victims, 770 MILLION SHARES were given to them. The caveat was the 90 day lockout period, barring some under the table large private offering. That lockout period ended 6 weeks ago, and the shares that were expected to be sold right away have been, and any that havent are expected to be held. 

So since the fire victims lockout period ended 6 weeks ago, the stock has risen 30%. Now all this is too logical for you dipshits so ill just say this next, PCG also partnered up with TESLA a couple months ago to build some ground breaking high tech energy storage system. I dont even know what the fuck a battery building is going to do but big dick Elon is down with it, so you should be down with PCG too.

This only valid for the first inclusion tranche, say they split it, doesnt matter. We need some large player, like.. say our all time hero Softbank with a war chest of $10B, give or take a few.

1. On Thursday, December 10, the autists of Softbank will buy December 18 calls. In total at least 1 Mio calls for 100 Mio shares. Possibly more. Call strike will be share price at the time +10%.
2. On December 11, majority of index funds will buy TSLA, driving the price up. Also MM will buy TSLA because they sold the fucking calls.
3. Once share price exceeds break even, large player will all start to exercise and sell to the index funds in small tranches until MM run dry.
4. Now its squeeze time.
5. Index funds might slow down because float runs dry but MM must continue buying. Guess who got some juice left? Our hero Softbank.
6. Softbank will continue to exercise. Forcing MM to buy shares at ANY price. Selling the shares back to MM, but not all, just enough to cover expenses of exercising! This will effectively reduce float until share price becomes ridiculous and MM are fucked in the process.
7. WSB Autists sell shares at $5000 a piece. And deep ITM calls or something.
8. Bears are fucked. MM are fucked. Index funds are sort of fucked. Softbank wins.

SPY 353p 12/18_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Lurker, First Time Poster, Full Time Autist _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Second Wave Stocks So we are already experiencing the second wave of covid and it is only going to get worse from here. States starting putting curfews and closing down some restaurants indoor eating and New York just temporarily closed their public schools. I imagine Thanksgiving and the day before, the most traveled days of the year, will lead to an even GREATER surge of covid. This will exaggerate the demand for shutting down the economy and with Biden's inauguration and political influence, I imagine the economy is even more likely to be shutdown.

Additionally, Trump just called for troops coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq which he did a few weeks before the economy shut down in March/April. I don't know if it is a signal, but it could be significant. Now the timeline may be farther out for all of this happening so I am going to be looking at longer-dated puts on companies very susceptible to the economy shutting down like airlines and casinos. Both BA and MGM have recovered quicker than many other stocks in their industries so I think they have some of the most meat on the bone if the market is to crash again.

Also, PLTR gang; that shit will keep going up. Nice.

&#x200B;

Edit: I would like to add that there is no way this crash is as significant as the initial one if it is to happen. So if you are following this idea, don't get too crazy with your strike prices like saying SPY will go almost to 200 again. I hope I am wrong about this, but the market started showing signs of hesitancy today, especially at close.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Thanksgiving travel makes an explosion of cases, Biden inauguration, the virus spreads more easily in Winter, the vaccine won't actually start making a difference until at least March, so I think gay bears might have a chance soon.

As all successful companies (see $TSLA, $NIO, $UBER) , Arrival has been substantially cash negative and plans to be cash positive by 2023. That means it's the perfect time to buy while they are still losing money (highly correlated with stonks).

$CIIC is confirmed merging with Arrival today, and news haven't got around most retail investors yet.

Arrival is a better play than HYLN and W\*rkH\*rse, [it already has a $1.2 Billions deal with UPS for 10000 EV](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/11/18/ev-upstart-arrival-plans-nasdaq-listing-that-will-lift-valuation-to-54-billion/?sh=466197f838fc) . It also just received [118 Millions from BlackRock](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/arrival-blackrock-electric-commercial-vehicle-production/). Hyundai and KIA Motors are also their investors.

Easily going up to $25 just from shares with minimal downside risks.

Merger agreement just came out today, news hasn't spreaded around retail investors yet. Get in before it explodes.

&#x200B;

***EDIT: Some of you are asking why this isn't another NKLA?***

NKLA or HYLN not a fair comparison in that both are vaporware without significant backers. **Arrival is backed by UPS (1.2B deal), BlackRock (118M), Hyundai and KIA Motors.**

More fair comparison would be Rivian (similar financial backing plus enterprise deal with AMZN, F is a backer), with working prototypes and Q3 2021 delivery dates. Rivian had an $8 billion valuation as of July's funding round.

A Q2 earnings beat and Q3 earning miss has left the IV of this months options sky high with no more catalysts between now and the option expiration date of 11/20. If you have buying power this means you should be selling the over priced options.

As it currently stands, a $15 put can be sold for 1.30. For the brain dead, stimulus check yoloing retards that have flooded this sub, that means you risk $1,370 for an immediate payday of $130.

When the options expire worthless on Friday you keep your money and lose nothing. Unlike buying ridiculously out of the money puts, the worst case scenario is you buy a put to cover, or receive the stock and hope it goes up.

With no earnings until February and no FDA rulings there are no catalysts to justify these option prices. [FDA tracker](https://www.fdatracker.com/fda-calendar/) to further prove there are no catalysts.

Because I bought in at $10.73 the day it listed, promised myself I would hold for years.

Yesterday I looked at my incredibly large account, then freaked out and sold at $17.93 to lock in my fat gains.

Several hours passed...

Last night, I laid in bed realizing this stock is only a couple months old and most of the world still doesn't even understand what it is they do.

I imagined the graph years from now, and realized we are still at the tiny little flat part at the very start. I dreamed of the day when we'll zoom way out and this is the beginning of the big ol' curve.

Then I also considered that Soros' statement is bullish as fuck, because his message was basically a testament to the power and potential of Palantir. Soros basically said, "I regret this unstoppable monster I helped create."

After some quick bed time googling, I discovered Soros is also openly anti Facebook and anti Google. Me thinks it's mighty interesting Soros lumps these guys in with them. I also noted that his anti-tech efforts haven't done jack shit to slow those companies down.

Then I thought of them tendies and had sweet dreams of richer days.

So at 3:30AM EST I set an alarm for 9:15AM EST.

This morning, while rubbing sleepy feels from my tired I eyes, I managed to twiddle my thumbs enough on my phone to get back in at $18.15.

Hello wsber, how're you doing to day? Are you all looking for a play that has huge upside potential with very little down side risk, does that ring a bell?
Reason for the post today is something just came across my deck. It's perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last 6 month. Do you have 60 seconds for me to share the idea with you, do you have a minute?

Name of the company, Ebay, it's is a low cutting e-commerce company that has really high margin profits compare to its competition. The stock now at 49, down from ATH at 61 several months ago. It's average price target is 55$. Its PE is 6.7 compare to Etsy's ~71, while they basically having similar bussiness model, make the stock really undervalued.
   In addition, the next month gonna be the best month of Ebay as the world go back into lockdown. Online sale will soar back, especially electronic sale. This is where everything Ebay favor due to the new Xbox, PS5, Nvidia new card, AMD cards and chips. They are all in shortage due to scalpers making big money reselling them on ebay. This shortage will last long and each of them sold will get ebay the juicy 10%.

FSR is using the Apple business model for bringing their first suv to market. Magma (ie their Foxconn) will be responsible for the manufacturing of the vehicle using existing facilities already in place (ie if there is a problem manufacturing, it’s not their problem or financial responsibility to fix it, it’s theirs.) Tesla has had several issues throughout the years trying to manage their own manufacturing. FSR won’t have this problem.

Once the Ocean is out on the market, other models that Henrik is designing now will be able to put on the market in months, not years like manufacturers take to bring something to market. So that means a lifestyle pickup, sedan, or whatever the hell Henrik thinks will sell and get people excited. 

The leasing plans favor Fisker financially. Customers can return the Ocean at any time. The down payment and cheap oem parts will help put the suv back out on the market where the next customer will put another down payment towards the slightly used vehicle. Every time Fisker sells a lease to a customer they get that down payment that secures their financial upside instead of a dealer that would take commission. The Ocean is ripe to be a profit machine so Fisker can then go on to develop more exciting vehicles. 

The Ocean will be in US and Europe in Q4 2022. China(!) will start getting it shortly after in 2023 using existing manufacturing plants in China already owned by Magna. This is a stupid simple play to be everywhere by 2024. 

FSR already has the money to put the first vehicle on the market without taking an offering from stock (no surprise offerings needed so you don’t have to worry about the stock suddenly tanking due to investor fear of a sell off.) It would take a massive run on this stock before some stupid analyst would say it’s overvalued for the stock to actually fall to a realistic valuation. Right now it’s completed undervalued. 

FSR is at sub 17 dollars right now with a sub 5billion market cap while NKLA has a fake partnership with GM, no solid plans to bring a vehicle to market and you retards value it at like 10 billion. First price target was 22 and second high price target is 40.

70 points down from October highs and people are still selling Alibaba? What kind of autist would still be selling their shares at this point after riding out this entire plummet? This company sells 74 Billion dollars of merchandise in a week. Sure I could see a 10% drop in the stock from from the IPO delay, but we shouldn’t even be worried about the financial regulations, it’s going to be nothing more then good-faith and logical policies that are truly for the better. A high-risk major lender can single handily crash an economy, these policies are very necessary. 

Ant group is just another small cog in an otherwise massive machine that is Alibaba anyways, and this company is wayyyyyy oversold at this point. 
Alibaba makes so much fucking money, and has massive market share in a MASSIVE market. 

We all know the Ant group IPO being stopped was a major setback for the stock; but we have to remember that China does not have the financial regulations that the U.S. has, nor is China interested in stopping the development of a company that’s a major factor in their economic growth as a nation. So whatever Financial or E-Com policies they implement won’t be any worse then here in America. 

Don’t worry everyone, regulations or not being a big player in the payments and lending game results in nothing but cash. I can assure you no regulations are going to stop Chinese idiots from agreeing to the classic 25% APR auto and person loans, just like the regulations don’t stop idiots from doing it in America. 

Sure Jack Ma’s ugly ass is retarted for talking shit about his own government, but the man is the co-founder of Alibaba, and the current lending system is China is actually absolute trash so I don’t blame him for saying it. 

It’s only a matter of time before people realize that in no way would the Chinese government stop the growth of a company like Alibaba, they just want to make sure that don’t stomp every little guy in the process, and that Ant group doesn’t cause a literal economic collapse, which they absolutely could.

**TL;DR - PLTR 150 12/31/21**

--------------

Now let's get started:

So, Palantir is up 105% from its average low of about 9 bucks. For the autists who bought in at the low, congrats and fuck you. For the retards who fomo'd in yesterday at ATH - I still love you, but [711k? That's ballsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jw7zed/i_heard_were_doing_pltr_now_my_whole_account_aka/).

Now I'm sure you're wondering: where the fuck is PLTR's ceiling? 

#PLTR's advantages, now with some data

I'll admit, most of my previous DD was equal parts BS and equal parts cocaine fueled shitposting that had a semblance of logic and formatting. But this time, I have **facts** in addition to my cocaine fueled shitposting. 

Realistically, Palantir's biggest advantage is that it helps large companies streamline their own disparate datasets without needing the companies do anything *to* that data. 

**This means:** Palantir clients don't have to change the way they operate to gain additional insights.

Essentially, a client would use Palantir's suite of tools like Gotham to parse through all of their data so that they can make better use of said data. This part from [their IR report](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) gets quoted a lot, but it's worth looking at:

> An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and **generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks** of starting to use our platform.
>
> The energy company **identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities** using our software, and the company’s management is currently **targeting $1 billion in total savings** in the coming year through the use of our platform. 

Again, keep in mind that all of this is happening without the client changing their data - i.e. no need to hire a dedicated team to handle data migration (along with all the risks associated with that), and no need to train their existing team to learn a new method for data entry.

Essentially: with minimal disruption to operations, this client is suddenly able to identify pathways for savings by using Palantir. 

The best part? 

This client can't *leave* Palantir because Palantir didn't *change* anything on the client's end. All Palantir did was give the client a tool that connects some dots between dataset A and dataset B that were previously unconnected. 

Get rid of Palantir, and that connection is lost: this is because dataset A and dataset B used to never talk to each other, and they'll probably still never talk to each other. All Palantir did was help the *humans* behind the wheel see the connection.

This means Palantir's non-government contracts are likely to be very sticky. Moreover, in instances of mergers and acquisitions, the marrying of data is usually a huge headache. If that headache can be reduced, then it smooths out potential friction in operations and allows new acquisitions to more quickly start performing and generating ROI for their new parent company.

--------------

#Palantir's Future

Palantir has a very bright future ahead of it for the following reasons:

- Large total addressable market
- Clean balance sheet
- Closer integration with the military

Palantir's total addressable market is estimated at 119 billion dollars. For you retards who don't know what TAM means, I'll spell it out for you:

> Total Addressable Market is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. 

But keep in mind that just because TAM is high doesn't necessarily mean that will all translate into income. As competitors emerge, they will eat into that market. But until a competitor can find the 21st century Osama bin-Laden, or help the US military fight an informationized war (more on that later), I don't think they'll be able to hold a candle to Palantir's capabilities. 

Which brings me to my next point: Palantir's balance sheet is sexy as fuck.

During their most recent earning call, they revised their revenue guidance upward to 1.07 to 1.072 *billion* in 2020. Let that number sink in. This is a 2500-person company bringing in over a BILLION dollars per year in revenue in what will most likely be incredibly *sticky* revenue. 

But retard, I can hear you say, you didn't see how much they lost. 

I did, you asshole. And I'm getting to it: 

Palantir's main losses came from employee stock compensation. Namely:

> The company reported a third-quarter net loss of $853.3 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a loss of $144.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its adjusted loss was $73 million, adjusted for $847 million in stock-based compensation. 

Personally, I don't see this as a loss, because retaining strong human talents in this space will be crucial for Palantir's continued dominance in this particular space. The stock-based compensation accounts for 99.26% of its entire third quarter net loss. 

Again, let that shit sink in. 

Meanwhile, Palantir *grew* its revenue: 

> Palantir brought in revenue of $289 million, a 52% increase from revenue of $191 million in the third quarter last year.

So long as Palantir can keep its stock-based compensation at a steady value--and I have no reason to believe that they won't--then, their continued increase in revenue will eventually outpace any such loss in the future. 

But most importantly, they have 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30th. Sitting on a pile of cash gives them operational flexibility and can help pad any unexpected issues that might arise. 

Which brings us to the final big point:

--------------

#Palantir and the Military

[I'll just link the Q3 earnings presentation for you](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) because it's got pretty pictures that you retards love. But here are the main points:

- Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense
- 2-year, $91M contract with US army research lab for AI and ML development
- Enabling Mission Command for NORAD & USNORTHCOM Joint All-Domain Command & Control (N/NC JADC2)

**Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense**

We're moving towards an era of even greater integration and interoperability in the military--not just between different branches but between different nation's militaries as well. One of the key factors that allowed the Allies to kick the shit out of Nazi Germany was a unified command structure. 

Palantir is building just that for the US and her allies. 

Think of how inefficient the military is, especially a military alliance that spans multiple nations, multiple languages, and multiple different command structures. 

Think of how *dumb* your average crayon-eating grunt is. You think Lance Corporal Fuckface is going to learn French or German or Polish so he can coordinate effectively with his counterpart in NATO and call in an airstrike? Or you think he'll just go through a simplified process of calling it in to the US chain of command, and that data gets relayed via Palantir's services to the appropriate French jet on station to deliver some ordnance? 

**US Army Research Lab Implication**

[This is the kind of shit](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-help-hunt-down-missile-sites-in-china/) that the US army uses AI and ML for:

- Identifying Chinese and Russian airbases, missile sites, and radars
- Significantly cut down on the amount of time a human has to sift through satellite images

This forms the informational logistical backbone in the era of informational warfare. Here is the example image from the slideshow where Palantir is used to [identify an airbase in the Russian Far East](https://i.imgur.com/X2irHFV.png), identifying crucial equipment and logistical nodes that can be prioritized in a war. 

**N/NC JADC2 Implications**

Palantir outright states that they're using AI to help provide course of action development to NORAD. It means we're one step closer to Skynet, baby! But more importantly, Palantir placed what looks to be an image of a [SIGINT/ELINT op](https://i.imgur.com/tiqwNu6.png) off the coast of Kamchatka. 

But that's not what you should focus on. You should focus on the fact that Palantir is now a crucial part of mission command in NORAD operations. Y'all remember Desert Storm? How the US Air Force basically clowned on Saddam's army for a month straight? That shit didn't emerge in a vacuum. It took 9 months of non-stop mission planning and 24/7 command and control during the op. 

Palantir's mission is to make the planning and command process of a similar op in the future *far more streamlined*. And given that China has more or less set a deadline for the reunification of Taiwan in 2049, the US needs to gear up for a major war in the Pacific while keeping an eye on Russia to make sure they don't try and rebuild the Soviet Union. 

And guess who will be passing all those delicious bits of data back and forth that entire time? 

Palantir.

Based on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. 

This is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.
@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.

According to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.

The BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.

Indeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:

Q2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B
Q1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B
Q4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B

So the current $16.5B difference is not normal.
The BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.

Assuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?

Another important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm

Furthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:

1) $AAPL
2) $AMZN
3) $BRK
4) $V
5) $JNJ
6) $JPM
7) $PG
8) $MA
9) $BAC
10) $KO

There are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ

None of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.

If it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...
25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:

https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html

So did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO ROCK BOTTOM 🤸‍♂️ BUY CALLS AND SHARES 🤯, AND FUCK THE BEARS 🐻🌈.

Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us under which they cannot sell, offer, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose of shares of our capital stock, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction or arrangement that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition or transfer of any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our capital stock, until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period”), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions.

Starting on the first day of trading, the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreements will no longer apply to (i) an aggregate of 383,609,647 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68,149,214 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units. The remaining 1,863,150,291 shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be able to be sold after the lock-up period, subject to applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. In addition, certain record holders subject to market standoff agreements with us have not signed the lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period. If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, up to an additional 37,369,371 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period. 89,007,617 shares held by our Founders and their affiliates will be permitted to be sold immediately under the Founders’ lock-up agreements and will be registered for resale pursuant to the registration statement..."

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/:
“One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”

Questions:
*****
1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares?
*****
2) I read "Our executive officers, directors..." Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this?

Answered by https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting 

In brief, all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

*****
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade?
*****
4) Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)?
*****
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded).
*****
6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:

https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements/default.aspx

As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir’s market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (“RSUs”). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?

With stock now above 19 and EV ~35B, if valuation approaches what Thiel et al seeming hoped for in next three months would they be expected to flood the market with shares? Then again they approved lockup? I don't understand._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What us going on with Virgin Galactic? The stock is skyrocketing

Nature can help us diversify. Hulk Dildo, Red bear Dildo, Shrek Dick, etc... These are all understandable and quickly defined terms, but they lack finesse, just like their namesakes.

This community could genuinely benefit from some more descriptive terms that help define stock activity at a glance, and given the propensity of the existing patois I think it's crucial that we don't abandon it for something more practical, but instead expand upon this rich foundation of our sodality.

Some examples:

[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nine-weirdest-penises-animal-kingdom-180976274/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nine-weirdest-penises-animal-kingdom-180976274/)

Penises, genitalia and orifices in general come in an astounding variety around the world. We need not limit ourselves to the droll simplicity of a mere handful of contextual comparisons. Many wonderful examples exist which can accurately portray market movements.

Some suggestions:

**The Dolphin Dick Diggler:** In and out in a flash, it's hard to tell where this sudden increase in volatility will take the market. Could wiggle up, could shoot down, might just bounce sideways, but no matter what it'll be over before you can react.

**The Theta Slug Plugger:** I'm not sure how I could accurately depict the similarities between what Theta Gang players do and the mating habits of the leopard slug using mere English. Go watch a video about Leopard Slug sex and tell me if you disagree.

**Heidelbergensis' Hanger (The HH Banger for short):** Invoking the presumed genital activity of the last human ancestor to have a barbed penis, this describes a market event in which a stock suddenly and violently shoots up significantly in value, only to remain at it's peak for an indefinite period before gradually going limp and losing a significant portion of it's gains.

The list of comparisons is vast, and I think invaluable. We could dramatically increase our understanding of market movements at a glance by incorporating these analogies into our daily vernacular.

Add your own analogies please, the more the merrier.

Really curious to see what can be alluded to being similar to a duck vagina.

Is that fair or is that just because $DOCU is less famous? The vaccine trade was easy to understand. With 95% effectiveness, market now believes more people will be returning to office sooner or later. WFH names like $ZM gets sold off, a 30% tumble month to date. In October I wrote a DD arguing why $ZM's valuation was too much. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcdsnq/zoom\_to\_the\_doom\_why\_long\_zm\_has\_become\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcdsnq/zoom_to_the_doom_why_long_zm_has_become_a/) The bulls hated me for that. Now in retrospect, **it was kinda obvious, wasn't it**?

But $ZM's other less famous WFH cousins, for example, $DOCU, only got sold off 9% this month. In case you have never heard of $DOCU, it is a company providing e-signature solutions. When the pandemic prevents people from meeting and signing in person, $DOCU benefited from strong demand for e-signature and remote signing. The two stocks $ZM and $DOCU have had strongly positive correlations. One goes up, the other goes up too. **Until now.**

Since the vaccine news came out, the performances start to drift, **with $DOCU now outperforms $ZM by 20% on the month**. Ok, another thing beyond my understanding happened. So **when the narrative of "returning to office" can hurt video conferencing business by almost 30%, it only hurts e-signature by 9%?** **So when people stop video conferencing and meet in person, they will still be signing electronically?** Hmm, I don't understand this. I mean **if you are now meeting in person already, why would you still have to sign electronically?** Isn't it easier to grab a pen and just do it than turning on your laptop, open a PDF file, then type?

Are there any corporate news coming out this month that strongly favors $DOCU?: **No I dont see any.** Maybe you care share with us if you have any insights.

Is it because $ZM was overvalued more and $DOCU was fair valued, so now $ZM drops more?: I don't think so. At this moment **$ZM is trading at forward P/E of 150.07 and $DOCU is trading at 312.31** (Bloomberg data). $DOCU's forward P/E is twice that of $ZM. If anything $ZM is a more mature company than $DOCU.

So what is the reason then? **Personally I think it is simply because fewer people know $DOCU.** When the vaccine news came out, everybody rushed to sell $ZM. And for $DOCU, what is that? Never heard of that.

**My position: Pair trade of long $ZM and short $DOCU. I am not bullish on $ZM. This is a pair trade betting their performance to converge.**

Let us hope for something more interesting this time around._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bull case for PLTR and why it's a direct investment into the US defense budget $PLTR isn't just a meme company. It is a direct investment into the US defense budget.
Like Stonks, the defense budget only goes up and to the right.

According to the DOD Releases Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Proposal, cyber security allocation is sky rocketing.
https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2079489/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2021-budget-proposal/

PLTR is in a prime position to gain from these trends.  It already has it's foot in the door in every police precinct.  Anyone in sales knows incremental upsells are easier to existing clients. And with a client like the US government and no other competition, it's shooting fish in a barrel.

PLTR also has deep institutional investors.  Anyone not long term on PLTR, ask yourselves what do you think you know that Soros doesn't?

Recently there have been reports of Soros saying he regrets his PLTR position.  How do we know it isn't clearly FUD? There's a chance the only thing he regrets is not buying a larger stake before the WSB meme status bump.

 More on Soros, "Soros has sold all the shares it’s permitted to sell at this time and will keep selling, according to the statement. “SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices,” the firm said."

Why is PLTR is sky rocketing with Soros selling? 

Per wiki, "Soros survived German-occupied-Hungary".  He sees some similarities between our nanny state direction, aided by PLTR, that the US is moving in akin to Nazi occupied Germany.  But just like Nazi Germany, it is too late to stop mass surveillance now, without a 3rd world war.  Which we will win because it will be a cyber war, and the NSA has PLTR.  

But don't let Soros' apprehension fool you given that Soros has already sold off some of his stake while PLTR continues to sky rocket.  Don't forget that Soros is 90 years old.  After a lifetime of wealth accumulation and ruling over the world, people like him often have "come to God" moments. This is a known phenomenon.  Similar to the Koch brothers regretting ruining America now that they're nearing death. 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-koch-says-his-partisanship-was-a-mistake-11605286893

For long term investors, aka time horizon >1 week, buying anything, shares, calls, leaps, whatever, cant go wrong.

For WSB autists, buy FDs 5 minutes to close and sell at peak of next day.  Repeat until enough tendies to afford a TSLA.

Don't be afraid of all time highs. The world's richest man at one point made his fortunes on buy high, sell higher.

The latest SPAC merger is Eos energy storage (EOSE) as of Monday. Why should you care about EOS?

Stationary energy storage to support the electricity grid is right on the cusp of going parabolic. Don’t take my word for it, check out Wood Mackenzie:  


https://preview.redd.it/oy98wvbxa0061.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=8439018d68d59d63ad883789bc684e5813d8bcd1

And you know what requires energy storage? Renewable energy like wind and solar when it produces power when people aren’t using it. How are renewable energy stocks doing?  Vestas makes wind turbines and they are up 93% YTD. First solar makes solar panels and they are up 43% YTD. These technologies need energy storage to continue their growth on the grid.

Biden says we are going to upgrade our infrastructure and do it in a clean way – that means green energy. Places like Texas and California already have so much wind and solar energy that they need storage in order to add more.

So why Eos:

\-Eos isn’t lithium ion like all of the other grid scale batteries. It uses zinc technology which is safe. What happens to unsafe technology like lithium ion? [They blow up](https://www.enr.com/articles/49809-utility-report-on-energy-storage-battery-blast-cites-equipment-flaw). Utilities don’t want this.

**Puts on TSLA's market share in China**

TSLA surged to highs based on strong sales revenues that actually came from its China consumer rebound sales and US investor cult stock enthusiam. But TSLA is lagging behind the competition in China. It's even being outsold by even US car companies's EVs in China:

* [Electric Car Sales More Than Double In World's Biggest EV Market, But Tesla Lags, IBD 11/11/2020](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-cars-china-sales-double-october-2020-tesla-trails/)

> Electric cars again outpaced traditional vehicles as China auto sales continued their pandemic rebound in October. But Tesla (TSLA) trailed both Chinese car giant BYD (BYDFF) and a General Motors (GM) joint venture in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles....

Demand for TSLA's EVs are below its production capacity (which is probably why they dramatically cut the selling price of its cars)

> But while Tesla was No. 2 in terms of October production, trailing only the SAIC-GM Wuling joint venture, it was No. 4 in terms of October sales. That underscores that local Chinese demand is far below production capacity.  

Its established competitors are well backed by US deep pockets/car majors

> Tesla sold 12,143 electric cars in China in October, as a new price cut helped buoy demand. But Tesla trailed the GM-SAIC Wuling joint venture, Warren Buffett-backed BYD and another SAIC unit. Tesla also exported about 10,000 made-in-China Model 3 cars to other countries, after saying it would start exports to European markets on Oct. 20.  

TSLA is also lowering its goals and promises in the US, cutting out the $35K Model 3, which has a history of over-promising and under delivering. It was promised in 2017, finally arrived in 2019 and is already being cut from the lineup. This is from a company with such deep pockets due to over-capitalization from its loving retail investor base that it's worth more than the Saudi family's collection of London flats. 

* [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/)

> The really cheapest Model 3 only lived for a few months, and Tesla sold a workaround option after that -- but not anymore... Electrek reported Monday, citing unnamed sources, that it's no longer possible to order the entry-level Model 3. Though, if we're being totally factual, the actual $35,000 Model 3 went away a long time ago.

**Pressured by NIO**

Chinese EVs are now gaining on TSLA, as well. According to its earnings report last night, NIO delivered 5K cars in October to TSLA's 12K cars, and unlike TSLA, there's demand that supports its production. There is strong demand for its cars.

* [NIO Inc. Reports Unaudited Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/17/2128703/0/en/NIO-Inc-Reports-Unaudited-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html)

* [NIO Inc. (NIO) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/11/nio-inc-nio-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

> Starting from October 2019, ES6 has ranked as the top-selling SUV across all EV sectors in China. For the first half of this year, ES8 has also achieved No. 1 in sales among mid- to large-sized luxury electric SUVs priced above RMB 400,000 in China.

**Nowhere to go but down**

Being added to the S&P 500 isn't a great thing for TSLA (or the S&P 500). They both have the same problem: inflated values with nowhere to go but down if the gov stops propping up stocks with new injections of money, fed buying and/or fiscal stimulus. If anything TSLA was a relatively safe haven from volatility as its unrealistically loyal retail customer base was supporting it at a more stable level than the indexed companies have been at, as indexed companies do go up and down as passive investors put money into index funds and pull money out. Make no mistake, this is why S&P Global finally added TSLA to the index. 

**ChEVs solid growth story, analyst ratings**

Analysts agree with the ChEV "bubble" more than they agree with the TSLA "bubble".. because the ChEV's aren't in a bubble. They are growing at a fantastic rate. They are all currently trading under their most recent price targets and so are values.

* [Did Credit Suisse just raise NIO's price target to $60 overnight?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/jwctqg/price_target_60_credit_susse/) 

Did Credit Suisse raise NIO's price target overnight? Who knows, we need confirmation of this SS. But what is clear is that analysts project its price target to be $150 if it exported to Europe & the US, as NIO is moving to do

* [Strong International Expansion to Drive NIO Stock to $150](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/strong-international-expansion-to-drive-nio-stock-to-150/)

> The key to NIO stock unlocking big returns from here lies in the company's ability to replicate its success all across the globe... To-date, no one has really talked about NIO’s ability to expand internationally, and potentially replicate its China success at a global scale.  

> My previous modeling — which assumed NIO dominated the premium electric vehicle market in China alone — produced a long-term price target for NIO stock of $60. But, after accounting for international expansion opportunities and assuming NIO does fairly well in non-China premium EV markets, my modeling now produces a long-term price target for NIO stock all the way up at $150.

**When it comes to interpreting trading action of a ChEV stock, you have to follow the basket**

US investors get too distracted by the daily trading moves of one out of a basket of ChEV stocks, making them prime suckers for smart options traders. ChEV investors who are really investing in this sector have a basket of stocks that they focus on, and the daily price moves of any one stock like NIO don't mean jack to us. While you all were being distracted by NIO's potential for spiking up and down on an earnings report and are drawing wild conclusions about it being relatively flat afterward, this is was I was focused on yesterday and the day before:

* [KNDI up > 50% in the past few days](https://finviz.com/publish/111820/KNDIc0dl0806.png)  

NIO already got its price bump from earnings week at the same time XPEV, LI & NIO all rocketed up last week. All you're seeing this week is tail action... while ChEV investors are following KNDI.

You can't focus on just one ChEV stock if you want to understand how any particular ChEV is trading. 

Here's my current basket:

* XPEV  
* NIO  
* LI  
* NIU  
* KNDI  
* CBAT

And also check out CBAT's crazy 🚀 in the past few days as well. 

Because most US investors get misled by not following the ChEV stocks the way they should be followed, WSB can make money off their mistakes and misreadings. 

Also, you may want to stop obsessing over TSLA, because IMO the obvious crazy money left to be made of TSLA is by ppl who get their puts in early instead of riding that stock down. Is it even better than a HOLD right now?

Literally the only pro wiling to go out on a limb and neg the ChEVs are the hack who shorts stuff using hack analysis, Andrew Flake, who is an actual real world cuck whose wife's boyfriend is a ChEV investor.

It seems like almost everything that was very popular here has erupted (though often a few months later than people had hoped). Of course, many people will win/lose depending on entry time, but overall these last 4-6 months seems to have been super successful for almost every meme stock here. 

I'm wondering if this is extremely unprecedented, or if this is basically a fucked up ensembling method where all of us autists are shitty individually, but as a group we converge to pretty good accuracy (ignoring entry timing). 

I'm sure a portion of it is backwards looking / momentum based where the hype around a stock that has already shown upside is what makes it a meme stock, as opposed to it being a meme before generating significant return. However, I don't think you can attribute all of it to this, because many of them continue to succeed (sometimes at a greater rate) after becoming a meme. 

Either way, it seems pretty wild. If this is uncommon, the next 2+ years will probably fleece a lot of people who started "investing" during this time and have a lot of bias toward meme stocks succeeding._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wtf is this 3%?

1. DON'T fucking post gain porn unless you made more than 10k or 10X your gain... We have seen really some CRAZY shit back in the Kodak and Hertz days, your small peepee gain using your allowance from grandma doesn't impress anyone here.


2. PLEEEAAASE DON'T ask stupid questions that you can find the answers on r/investing, r/stock, Google or YouTube. This includes: "What are some investing tips? What are options? I'm going to do my first option, what should I invest in?" This is a bigggg community, and there are shit tons of post everyday and I feel like the quality of posts are getting worse and worse.... and this types of shit is one of the major problem.


3. Don't call your bullshit a DD. Why the fuck are there ppl who just write two sentences that goes something like "____ is going to pump, ride it before it moons." Like wtf, before you post anything, think about whether this would actually add a value to someone else's day....

If you hold baba calls, dump that shit at open. If you want to buy baba calls, wait one more day.

Muddy water research might short the fuck out of them tomorrow. A few hours ago they mentioned some kind of Chinese fraud exposure happening tomorrow. Link below (affiliated group)

https://twitter.com/zer0estv/status/1328864194247225347?s=21

I dug around, and the only Chinese stock mentioned was BABA. No liked tweets point to any specific stock.

https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1327355093289631744?s=21

They’ve been working on a report for a while now, and it’s coming tomorrow. These guys have credibility. If it’s BABA, they are fucked, and your calls are fucked.

ARK sold off their BABA shares on 11/17, the report is coming 11/18. They would know of this was coming. Chinese stocks are at risk tomorrow, including EV.

I hope I’m wrong. I loaded baba calls today. The downside is so much larger than the upside. Be careful. Wait until the report comes to buy calls.

I’m retarded btw

EDIT: I’m not saying baba will guaranteed be fucked. I’m saying tomorrow is not the day to buy leaps. If you come back to this post angry because baba goes up tomorrow, you are as retarded as me.

My friend asked me something I could not answer, I tried in /r/options, they told me it's an IV crush (that's what I thought) but when I checked the IV level something is not matching...

So, my friend, quite risky, I told him he belongs here, bought on 9th of Nov QQQ Jan 15'21 350c for $0.71 apiece (before the drop). The stock was 294 when he bought it, he cannot remember IV but according to some historical sites, IV didn't change that much between 9 and today (17th).

Right now, $0.28, so 60% loss, same price (we checked when it was 294) IV at 23%...

Theta was quite a bitch, but not that much, not for that 60%...

As you all know, QQQ dropped 10 points last week and then returned.

And if you wanna know, I have ~$100K in this stock (https://i.imgur.com/rShgsiO.png).

The stock is MDXG and its just been relisted on the Nasdaq after time spent on OTC due to poor accounting practices years ago (channel stuffing or some baby shit that has been cleared up as far as MiMedx is concerned, it doesn't matter much now after overhauling management, their financials being audited, getting some earnings under their belt, and getting relisted on Nasdaq - putting past issues mostly in the rearview). That shits been cleaned up, theres new Management, a new PRO level board of directors, recovering sales, and a golden goose Therapeutic Biologics pipeline in late Phase studies and its going up from here.

So whats the deal? The stock is trading cheap still ($6.66) compared to prior to delisting ($17) and Analysts have yet to get on board again. In my opinion the company is still known as an Advanced Wound Care company and the current price doesnt even reflect the value for just the known AWC business, let alone reflect the golden goose that is the emerging Therapeutic Biologics business including the BIG Knee Osteoarthritis injectable that just completed Phase 2B enrollment, nor the conclusion of enrollment for a Phase 3 study of their Plantar Fasciitis (Estimated Study Completion Date April 2021) and Achille Tendonitis injectable (Estimated Primary Completion Date May 2021).  
  
Since delisting:   
1. MiMedx just announced the largest U.S. Commercial payor will now provide coverage for EpiFix (One of their Advanced Wound Care products), which means its first in line to be chosen by doctors.   
2. MiMedx has since developed their Knee Osteoartritis injectable treatment and just currently concluded Phase 2B enrollment and everything is on track to be best in class.   And it has its Achilles and Plantar Fasciitis injectables in Phase 3.  
3. MiMedx has an Analyst presentation at the Canaccord Genuity Virtual MedTech & Diagnostics Forum this Thursday as part of their roadshow thats gearing up.   
4. There's a Shareholder call Friday where we are likely to hear more about whats to come here in regards to the Knee Osteoarthritis treatment and other products in the pipeline.   
5. All new Management Team and Board of Directors   
6. Plenty of cash  
7. Tons of new rockstar hires added to the management roster, not some scrubs.

Once analysts and more people pick this shit up and realize what the potential is, its GOING. TO. MOON.  

Why do I have such high hopes in this stock in regards to Knee Osteoarthritis? Look at UBX which was developing a Knee Osteoarthritis product that failed and it dropped their price target from $35 to $4, wiping $1.8B off their Market Cap. MDXG has likely the best product in this area and should have that factored into the price, but it doesnt YET. MDXG is still only valued at $700M which is lower than when they were just doing Wound Care prior to delisting!  

What else? Check out the new board members and tell me there isnt a potential for a good mid term buyout as well with all the connections to names like 3M and Medtronic.

If you don’t give a shit about financials or value or growth potential or whatnot tl;dr is buy shares. All of this is my opinion and should not be believed as fact, do your own research.

Hey guys, so today was a little interesting for this company, Viatris. Borne of the Upjohn-Mylan merger I thought it might be fair for me to type this up, as I get to be first and you get to be in on a “new” stock. The plan to return profits to shareholders are to instate a dividend consisting of 25% of free cash flow, after Q4 2020 ends. I’m not gonna go on about the great things Mylan is doing outside of the United States or how Pfizer is making a big fat mistake in selling Upjohn, mostly because I don’t know enough. What I do know, personally, is that costs for designer drugs such as vyvanse are going up crazy amounts year over year, while generic adderall/alprazolam is looking like a much more affordable and appealing medication, to those who need them of course.

As far as financials, who knows. I’m using 1/8th of Pfizer’s revenue added on to Mylan’s.

Market cap: Around 20 billion.

Mylan had a pretty impressively profitable Q3, surprising some but not me. With total revenue of 2.97 billion and net income of 185 million, they were profitable and grew year over year, and you get to add on roughly 1.35 billion and 150 million, respectively. Pretty good I’d say, and if you look at the previous years Mylan has had, they struggled to hold up their valuation once at an aggressively overbought state… and it’s going to happen again. As 25% of free cash flow, the dividend yield is about 10% of the stocks current price… Which is why the next 3 months will probably lead to a natural growth in the stock price. Or maybe after 3 months? The only 100% wrong answer, is never.

Investing Strategy:
As tempted as I am to sell puts on this stock, I’m not able. This stock is gonna drop mornings, spike very hard, and then finish the day somewhere up very often… We sell calls. I like the April 2021 strike price, pick whatever price you’d be fine with buying the shares at, and then sell weekly covered call against it for maybe 5ish percent a week. After that point you’re gonna want to exercise your calls and hold, collecting the 8ish percent dividend, and then just sell calls & puts on it, because this is the type of 1000 year company you’re gonna remember in 3020. Again all of this is my opinion, but the entire company is - good looks. We don’t talk about debt here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let start a RIOT!!!🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RIOT moved up 50% today!

Maybe lean slightly conservative and take advantage of the crazy premiums (like somebody willing to pay you $6 for a $20 call) and then look for a pull back to the low teens to buy them back.

I dont know if this is true or not, but it sounds like something is goin on if this stock that has been less than 0.15/share since i bought it, is now trading at $3/share.

I still have my certificates, however the problem now is what good are they if I cant sell them. Etrade wont take OTC stock certificates. Charles Shuabb said they would honor the certificates, however when I looked at them I saw there was a restricted notice, and CS said they wouldn't take the certificates with the restricted notice while it is still a penny stock. The restricted notice is:

However there is a restriction notice on them that states:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and may not be sold or transferred without registration under said Act or exemption therefrom"

Does anyone know anything about this, or what I can do with my shares. Is there anywhere I can sell them?

Title._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could’ve had a better buy in but tsla to the moon! 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can We Invest in Thailand now?!! https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/thailand-to-allow-medical-use-of-cocaine-opium-and-morphine/

Talk about truly "ups and downs"...thailand is going to be the living stock market legalizing this stuff for medical use_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ China to the moon _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have an actual question regarding PLTR Hey so I know this the last place to come for legitimate advice, but I’m a retard, so you do what you can.

Anyway, I got some PLTR 11c and 12.5c on Oct. 28, they expire 5/21 and are up some big ol’ chunk so far.

So everyone on here says to never exercise your options...so what do you guys think? I know the meme is to ride them til expiry and let them expire useless blah blah, but I’m legitimately curious what my best course of action for maximum chimkin is.

Other Positions: PLTR 30c 11/19/2021, some SABR and SAVE calls, a NIO long call bc I’m a degenerate piece of filth...some other shit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO Q3 results _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thank You I just sit on the sidelines and buy normal positions in pretty much every ticker mentioned here. I don’t research the company. I make a profit. I sell. I take it off my watchlist and move on to the next hyped up meme stonk. Is it annoying to see some retard make my yearly gain in a day once in a while? Fuck yes. Am I going to stick my tip in just “to see what it feels like?” No. 

So I just want to say thank you to everyone here for all of the leads on shittily-run, debt-heavy companies that have doubled my income this year. Y’all the real mvp’s_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bought 10 PLTR CALLS AND 100 shares yesterday then piled on the rest of the calls this morning. The next couple weeks will be fun. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Everyone talking about PLTR and NIO But them CRSR tendies going to be so delicious. 

Don’t sleep on em._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next Big Thing kinda post! My portfolio is pretty much mainly made up on Tech and EV stocks. I’m looking to invest in 2 or 3 more, ideally in a different sector to diversify a little but it’s not crucial. The hope, like everyone, is to find the ‘next big thing’ I have quite a high risk tolerance. 

After doing some research my thoughts on one’s that could do well are
SBE - Dunno if Tesla will take away much of their market though
ICLN - Seems expensive atm from what people are saying
PLTR - This one seems pretty high risk but with the chance of strong returns
BLDP
LIT
FAN

I know some of these are connected to EV and Tech. Lithium and batteries seems like it will grow. 

SQ is another one. I dunno if people think this will continue to do well or if it’s at a pretty high price currently?

Be great to get people’s thoughts on the above stocks and any others that have great potential that I’ve failed to mention. I’m open to any sector tbh. Clean Energy seems like it’s going to only grow but I don’t know much about the space and I’m struggling to find anything I’m really confident on, hence ICLN and FAN.
