 Lion the next EV SuperSPAC (DD) The next EV SPAC is here. You might have already heard of it. The Lion Electric Co.

No EV SPAC has gone bad this far and this is way better than Fisker which means this won't be the first one that crashes and burns. They produce EV tucks and buses AND school buses. The market is $110 billion per year and the company is currently valued around $2 billion. This means they have plenty room to grow.

Compared to Nikola these guys actually have trucks already being delivered. They have currently sold 300 units and Amazon is testing their trucks and if they like them it will be a rocket like you've never seen before.

They are aiming for 6x revenue growth in 2021 and over 18000 units sold in 2024. Now you're thinking these are empty promises but let's say they're not that empty. Even if we half these numbers it's not a bad buy.

Also, they make their trucks from the ground up which makes them able to grow infinitely. They are the only ones that might compete with the Tesla semi.

They currently go under northern genesis acquisition co or NGA.

TLDR; EV trucks could compete with Tesla (i know it's amazing). Small company = more pump, buy it and fly it... to the moon.

I'm not saying I know for certain why the market is going up today. I'm saying that CNBC was so sure it would go down on a democratic sweep and that's clearly not happening. Be careful about agendas in financial news, especially CNBC. It's all just confirmation bias day after day. (Not saying it doesn't have entertainment value; just be careful.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The case for investing in an Israeli ETF Israel is leading the world in COVID-19 vaccinations, having vaccinated over 15% of its population in two weeks [1]. For comparison, as of yesterday France has vaccinated roughly 500 people [2] (yes, you read that right). In the United States, the corresponding share of the population vaccinated seems to be around 1.5% in the same time period [3]. 


It seems very likely this disparity will persist into the future. Various theories have been suggested in the media as to why Israel has done well (a semi-centralized medical system, small geographical area). My guess is that because Israel has been in a near-constant state of war since its birth, it has a government that is relatively good at solving logistical problems. Additionally, the Israeli PM is up for re-election, is set to be put on trial for corruption, and has a very strong incentive to have the country perform well on COVID-vaccinations in the near future.



I'd even suggest the disparity between Israel and other countries may accelerate in the coming weeks: most US vaccines are sitting unused [4], which is why it is somewhat pointless for Pfizer/Moderna to keep delivering more and more in the near future. Unless the US solves the problem of distributing vaccines quickly,  some renegotiation may lead to vaccines being sent to countries which are actively using them. 


To summarize: it seems reasonable that Israel will be the first country to escape lockdowns. I'm also going to predict, based on the current vaccination speeds, it will be many months of the US and Europe being in lockdown while Israel is not. This article [5], for example, states that at the current pace of vaccinations, it will take *years* for all of the US to be vaccinated. Presumably things will pick up, so that estimating years of difference is too much, but a substantial gap should still remain.  This will inevitably lead to not just economic growth in Israel but extra opportunities for exports as companies throughout the world right now are operating at less than full capacity.

I'm not sure how to price this properly, but it seems that, as of writing, the market has not been affected very much by the vaccination news over the past two weeks. See for example [the performance of an Israeli index fund over the past couple of weeks](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EIS/chart?p=EIS#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-).

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Balancing FOMO and the inevitable correction/bubble burst. I have been investing since 2008 when I was in college and recognized a unique opportunity and realized that my $5,000 savings was not much compared to my future earnings.  So I dumped my money into WF and turned it into about $15k in a year.  Since about 2011, I have been investing in mainly ETF index funds with the occasional individual stock.  I have a 401K thru work that invests in 2 separate index funds where about half my money is.  Another 25% is in IRAs that I use to actively trade individual stocks and another 25% is in a brokerage account where I had a few ETF (ARKK and VB) and a mutual fund.  Last year all my accounts performed well, especially my IRA due to some lucky trade timing.  My 2020 return was about 30% overall.  However, early this week I sold a bunch of assets in my IRA and brokerage account and am sitting on about 40% cash.  Only holding ARKK and the funds in my 401K.

Question is, is anyone else struggling to balance the FOMO on this crazy overvalued momentum swing versus a belief that an inevitable correction is going to occur?  I am paralyzed in deciding to get back in because when I look at all these fundamentals none of it is making sense.  That doesn’t even account for the elephant in the room of the impact all this stimulus may have by causing potential hyperinflation.  My strategy has always been to sell when valuations become absurd.  Historically I have always been able to find other value and buy back in.  Now I am struggling because it seems like everything is overvalued.

Hey guys,

I am fully aware that I should definitely not base my decisions on the internet but I know that there are some experienced users here and maybe they would like to give their opinion.

I was supposed to go finish my bachelor in Australia but due to the pandemic, it will be delayed from 6 months to a year. I have about 40k in my bank account since it was supposed to cost me that and I currently have a revenue of about 70k/year.

I already started to invest in the stock market a little bit but since I am going to be staying here I want to invest much more. My two options are the following:

1. Drop 20k in stocks and wait.
2. Buy a condo with down payment of 20k and rent it out (I still live at my parent's place)

&nbsp;

I have recently seen a video from Ben Felix (which I recommend, great content) where he showed that Small Value Cap Stocks tend to outperform Large Cap stocks.

Here is some data:

Annualized since 1994 we have the following Gross Returns:

MSCI World: 7,42%

MSCI Large Cap: 7,77%

MSCI Small Cap Value: 7,82%  

&nbsp;

It does seem that Small Cap Value has outperformed Large Cap.

As per usual his investment advice is to own a low cost World ETF. But he said that if that was not exciting enough you could consider adding a little more weight to Small Value Cap Stocks. (more potential returns=more risk).

&nbsp;

My question is about Momentum Factor.

Annualized since 1994 it has a Gross Returns of 11,55% (!)

I was thinking 80% MSCI World + 20% MSCI World Momentum (I am aware of the overlap).

Is that statistically reliable enough to add to my Portfolio? Am I trying to beat the market? What am I missing?

My guess is, that these companies still have other energy sources that are not renewable and therefore do not fulfill the C02 footprint requirements of the index, but I have no transparency about that. This lead to the questions though:

I’m not some rich kid, this money is the result of 10 years of grueling work. Long story short, I want to get out. Actually, I’m already out (85% cash), but I realized that even cash is an explicit decision. Not only cash is a decision, even the currency is a decision. I’m originally from Europe and it’s likely that I’ll go back at some point. At the moment I sit on USD 425k, but I can imagine a number of reasons why cash might be a bad idea. With a timeframe of 20 years:

- USD might depreciate substantially w.r.t. to EUR, so my hard-earned money might be worth substantially less in my home country.

- Inflation is inevitably going to decrease the value of cash over time.

- New currencies like Bitcoin might devalue traditional fiat currencies. I’m not a fan of crypto-currencies, but the truth is no one knows what the financial landscape is going to look like in a few decades.

My question is: how do I preserve the purchasing power of my savings in a safe and currency-agnostic way? I’m not after crazy returns, I just want to make sure that my current purchasing power is preserved.
