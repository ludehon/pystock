$TPR had Q1 earnings yesterday with reported EPS of $0.83. In reality it's much lower. Someone show me if I'm doing my math right on this. Their first quarter of their fiscal year wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be but it wasn't amazing either considering retail is still suffering hard from COVID-19 and less spending due to issues with the recession we're in. But they reported $0.83 diluted EPS. The year ago period was $0.07 EPS. Except:

\-They got a $92M benefit from the CARES Act and they utilized a net operating loss (NOL) carryback claim.

\-SGA costs dropped massively. Which is good and as a long term shareholder something I want to see continue happening. SGA is bloated and I want to see it drop more in the future.

\-Interest expense rose 57%, drawing down on debt due to COVID and to have liquidity for the various expenses that COVID created. Understandable.

\-Operating earnings per share (277.9M diluted shares outstanding) was $0.72. But reported EPS was $0.84. How? Because of the tax benefit and one time help from the CARES Act.

\-Pre-tax income was $185.4M  You can do this by taking net income and adding income tax expense to it. Take $185.4M and subtract $92M from it. Why? Because that CARES Act benefit is one time. It's not what the company earned through its operations. So you get $93.4M. Divide that by the 277.9M shares outstanding and you get $0.33 EPS.

\-And you can make it harder for the company also. If taxed at the corporate rate of 21%, then EPS is lower. Take 21% from $93.4M and you get $19,614,000. So $73,786,000 was their net income if you use the current corporate tax rate. Now EPS is $0.26. Not $0.83. $0.83 was triple what they made with one time items being taken out.  


EDIT: Alright so it seems I haven't gone far enough with how I should've seen their earnings. They dropped COGS by 2.74% from the 2019 same year period. It WAS 31.91% of sales in the same year period in 2019 but now it's 29.17%, a 2.74% drop. It benefits reported EPS by $0.09. And SGA dropped to 53.57% of sales when it WAS 63.54% of sales in 2019 same year period. That drop in SGA benefits EPS by $0.33. And THEN the CARES Act helping them with $92M, another EPS benefit of $0.33. So I did this. $0.83-$0.33-$0.33-$0.09. You get $0.08 adjusted EPS. **This is all after taxes and I used a 21% corporate tax rate because that tax benefit they got from the CARES Act is one time. They don't exist as a corporation to get tax benefits.** 

2019 same year period EPS was $0.07. Adjusted for the drops in costs that benefited EPS and they rasied EPS **by a penny. It went from $0.07 to $0.08. I'm still long the shares and I'm still bullish but that doesn't leave me an excuse to not be vigorous with reading these numbers.** _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stocks just wrapped up their worst week since March >It has been a [messy week for the stock market](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/28/business/dow-stock-market-today/index.html).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Retail investors placed bids for a record $3 trillion of shares in Ant Group Co Ltd’s initial public offering (IPO), set to be the world’s biggest, as mom-and-pop savers bet on demand for its financial services in China.

The Shanghai leg of the IPO drew about 19 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) of bids from retail investors, or 872 times the number of shares earmarked for them, a company filing to the stock exchange showed on Thursday.

In the second quarter, GDP decreased 32.8 percent, or $2.04 trillion https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2020-advance-estimate

From BEA website:

Current‑dollar GDP increased 38.0 percent, or $1.64 trillion, in the third quarter to a level of $21.16 trillion. In the second quarter, GDP decreased 32.8 percent, or $2.04 trillion (tables 1 and 3).

The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.4 percent in the third quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 1.4 percent in the second quarter (table 4). The PCE price index increased 3.7 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.6 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 3.5 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 0.8 percent.

Personal Income

Current-dollar personal income decreased $540.6 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of $1.45 trillion in the second quarter. The decrease in personal income was more than accounted for by a decrease in personal current transfer receipts (notably, government social benefits related to pandemic relief programs) that was partly offset by increases in compensation and proprietors' income (table 8). Additional information on several factors impacting personal income can be found in "Effects of Selected Federal Pandemic Response Programs on Personal Income."

Disposable personal income decreased $636.7 billion, or 13.2 percent, in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of $1.60 trillion, or 44.3 percent, in the second quarter. Real disposable personal income decreased 16.3 percent, in contrast to an increase of 46.6 percent.

Personal saving was $2.78 trillion in the third quarter, compared with $4.71 trillion in the second quarter. The personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was 15.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with 25.7 percent in the second quarter._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ABBV - beat earnings, improved guidance, increased dividend 10%, zero discussion I see a lot of talk on here about the big tech and disruptors, but not much about Aristocrats like ABBV.

**Why do we talk about it after the reports published?** 

There is a certain advantage when a company publishes its earnings report before the market opens, a proper analysis of the situation combined with the ability to understand the report data is like playing poker when we know we can see most of the cards of the other players at the table!   


💎**Exxon Mobil (XOM)**

The company is one of the world's largest companies by revenue. 

The company already published the report showed better results in terms of earnings per stock (EPS) and revenue.

From 1996 to 2017 varied from the first to sixth-largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.

Earlier this month, the company announced that it will cut over 1,600 jobs in Europe as a result of the Covid, this may seem like bad news but layoffs often push the stock price upward and attract most institutional investors.

Despite the global trend of reducing crude oil dependence, the company does not appear to be significantly affected by this in the coming years, keeping the company as a must-have asset in every portfolio.

**Employees**: Over 71,000

**Revenue in 2019**: $265 billion

**Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $45 billion, result: $46.2 billion

&#x200B;

💎**Chevron**

The company already published the report, EPS came extremely positive (forecast: -$0.23 Vs the actual result: $0.11) but the revenue went a bit below forecast, not something that will affect the stock price and certainly not in the mid/long term.

One of the successor companies of Standard Oil is headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries.

Same like Exxon, it can take at least a decade until the green energy trend will significantly hit the company's profitability and even then, the company is an extremely big corporation with almost unlimited resources which of course helps them adopt other profit models and units.
