Overlapping ETF holdings. How to calculate total exposure to each stock? I have a few ETFs with overlapping holdings, and some individual stocks that also overlap. Is there an online tool to calculate my total exposure across all ETF + individual stocks?

I saw [this tool by ETFRC](https://www.etfrc.com/articles/index.php/2020/10/15/find-fix-unwanted-exposures-with-portfolio-zoomlens/) but it requires a paid membership. Is there a tool I can access for free?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good timing to short inflated tech stocks? Since the unravel of covid, almost all tech skyrocketed, to put it mildly. Given the context, it is understandable that most of these companies, especially the ones offering digital/cloud solutions are doing well during these times. Although, the current valuations for most of them seem very speculative. The price gets pumped even more with every positive earnings report and with any negative news around covid.
I think, we can all imagine in max 1-2 years things to return to something resembling the old normal. In that scenario, the inflated stock valuations don't make sense and they will likely fall hard. 

One stock in particular, that is overhyped and I think has the most to drop is zoom. Two main reasons:

1. As things return to a new normal there will be a decrease in usage for such services. 
2. There is plenty of capable competition out there with free/cheap alternatives. One of the best, I would say is Microsoft.

My expectation is that most of their new clients are in a yearly subscription that started in March/April. If things start to improve (i.e. vaccine) I would be quite confident that most new clients will switch to monthly subscription and slowly start to reduce usage as the majority of employees return to the office, universities restart face to face, etc.
My expectation is that in the second half of next year (the latest) we should see cracks in the growth case for zoom - where revenue plateaus or starts to decline and in addition to this there should be a rotation from growth/momentum stocks to value stocks. All these combined, for me build up a good case for buying long date puts on zoom. 

What do you think? Looking for challenging points of view. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking to find more fundamental, anti-institutional value firms Hi,

Dylan Moss_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tech companies can scale globally with low additional cost. Therefore 10-baggers will continue to be small-medium sized tech companies? This is especially true of pure software or internet companies that still have small or medium sized market caps. For example Unity, draft kings, lemonade, slack, square, etc... Can all gain 1 million+ new customers. With very little additional overhead cost to infrastructure.  

Meanwhile companies like Costco requires millions of dollars and time to build additional warehouses to acquire new customers. Value stocks started underperforming growth stocks 10-15 years ago. Which coincided with when tech in the US really started taking off. 


Anyways this is another reason why tech and ETFs like ARKK and QQQJ might continue to outperform. Because they pick small or medium sized (in terms of market cap) tech companies that are innovative. Yes the fast growth potential may be priced in, but when looking for possible 10x investments, it seems that the majority of the time it will continue to be tech companies for some time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long term, are ETFs the future, and are mutual funds over? Let's say someone is starting a retirement account containing a few index funds. Let's say they're doing it on their own, not through an employer, so they can invest in anything. They want a simple set-it-and-forget-it portfolio that they can keep contributing to and not withdraw from for 20-40 years. Should they choose mutual funds or ETFs?

I know the differences between ETFs and mutual funds. That's not what I'm asking. I'm wondering if investors, in general, are pretty much switching to ETFs for new investments and if this will eventually be a permanent shift. In 40 years, will everyone be investing in ETFs, and will once-gigantic mutual funds like VFIAX and VTSAX have been long-closed to new investors? Or will people *still* be asking the question, ETFs or mutual funds?

Speaking of Vanguard, for all of their most popular index funds, the ETF version now has a lower expense ratio than the admiral shares version. Maybe that's just because ETFs are less costly for them to manage? But I'm pretty sure they used to be the same a few years ago. Are they trying to incentivize people to switch to ETFs? Also, Vanguard has created a significant number of new ETFs in recent years that don't have a mutual fund version at all. Are they signaling that mutual funds are over?

Personally, for long-term investing, I like the idea of mutual funds, mainly for psychological reasons. I don't have to pay attention to the share price because I buy in dollar amounts, not shares. I don't have to transact while the market is open. There's only one price per day, so I'm not really tempted to check how the market is doing during trading hours. All of these things help me stay the course. But I also look at the lower fees on ETFs and can't ignore that. I also look at new interesting ETFs popping up like all the ESG index funds that seem like maybe a good long-term investment, but there's usually no passive/index mutual fund equivalent.

So in 40 years, will ETFs have won, and will mutual funds be a thing of the past? What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fund that tracks the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index? Hi, I’ve been looking for an ETF that tracks the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index and can be purchased on either Canadian or US stock exchanges. The closest ETF I can find is EUFN from BlackRock which instead follows the MSCI Europe Financials Index. This ETF is comprised of only 40% banks while the remaining 60% is in various other financials, and it has a large exposure to the UK. However, what I’ve been searching for is something similar to EXX1 (also run by BlackRock) which is unfortunately listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Theoretically, I could contact my broker and purchase shares of that ETF but I would be hit with a 1% commission fee per trade for trading internationally which isn’t ideal as I’m planning to cost-average over the next \~6 months.

I traded it once, on the day of that recent long, hollow green candle and made a nice little profit (large for some, de minimis for others, depending on perspective).  It appears that per current battery technology, lithium is going to be the de facto maxime amet element for battery technologies.  It is seemingly plain on the face that we are undergoing a transition from the internal combustion engine powered vehicles to EVs, thereby making lithium one of the most important elements in the universe.  Lithium is generally commercially provided for battery production as either lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate (LCE), the global demand in 2018 was 270,000 megatons (mt) and is expected to TRIPLE to 800,000 mt by 2025.  According to Joe Lowry, "Mr. Lithium", while the market price for battery quality (BQ) LCE is unstandardized and opaque, the going price in China is about $7,000/mt and in Japan and South Korea about $10,000/mt, but that due to shortages it should rise to about $12,000/mt.  He also holds that lithium, as a raw resource is plentiful, investment to pull it from the earth (brine and spodumene) is woefully lacking.  I've seen such sentiments elsewhere.  On a side note, while Tesla's battery day was a brief but huge disappointment for investors, Musk's announcement that Tesla is getting into the lithium mining business is truly a forward looking and likely wise decision even if it wasn't 'sexy' enough to appease investors and traders at that time.  In this way, lithium mining company stocks have captured my own and, obviously many others attention.  Now, to the point, ABML is an interesting company, having ex-Tesla engineer, Ryan Melsert, as CTO, David Batstone, a UCSF professor, on its board, and Menka Sethi, formerly of Facebook, as COO and the tripartite aim to focus on recycling lithium-containing batteries, extraction, and primary resources (mining).  The company is building a first recycling facility in Fernley, Nevada and \*I believe\* they have claims for thousands of acres of lithium-containing areas in Nevada as well.  The company claims to be preparing to "process 20,000 mt per year of recycled material with their commercial pilot plant" and notes that only 90,000 mt were processed in a recent year.

&#x200B;

**Powell: Fed open to private sector collaboration in possible digital dollar** 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.

“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.

Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

“I actually do think this is one of those issues where it's more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first,” Powell said.

Powell pointed to the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, noting that the majority of the $2 trillion Federal Reserve notes in circulation are held outside of the country.

Powell emphasized that any possible digital dollar would serve as a “complement” to physical cash — not a replacement.

&#x200B;

**Real-time payments**

The U.S. finds itself lagging other countries on payments infrastructure. The Bank of Mexico last year launched a Cobro Digital (CoDi) system that allows users and merchants to transact in digital pesos using QR codes. The People’s Bank of China recently began user testing a digital renminbi, which would allow transactions even without connection to the internet.

Although the Fed is not committing to launching its own digital currency, the Fed is charging ahead with its efforts to bring real-time payments among financial intermediaries. Services like Venmo and Cash App offer quick peer-to-peer payments, but check clearing still takes days for funds to arrive at one’s checking account because of aged infrastructure connecting the nation’s banks.

The Fed hopes to stand up a FedNow system to allow 24/7 real-time payments by 2023 or 2024. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, one of the leaders on the initiative, said the project is “on track” with that timeline.

Although many central banks are researching digital currencies, only about 10% say they will actually issue one of their own in the short-term, according to the Bank of International Settlements._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Screening 13-Fs?

**The ETFs**

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF *(ICLN)* \- This one seems to be the most popular. It has the lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.46% and it's globally diversified. ICLN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 55%. This fund is 40% American and 60% Global. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and New Zealand. Basic preliminary knowledge of each country's economic/political situation can be helpful. This fund contains a ton of CORE Renewable Stock (Biofuels, Ethanol, Geothermal, Hydroelectric, Solar, Wind) but it's devoid of Tech Built On Renewables such as EVs — which seem to be the talk of the town nowadays. This fund follows the S&P Global Clean Energy Index and it's Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.

&#x200B;

First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF *(QCLN)* \- This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED. 

&#x200B;

ALPS Clean Energy ETF *(ACES)* \- This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%.  This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) *minus* the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.
