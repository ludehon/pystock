 Have 50k to invest, how does this split look? As the title says I've 50k USD to invest. Planning to split it up amongst these growth stocks - 

NIO - 60% (30k) - NIO has had a crazy run up, but I think they still have more room to grow in 2021. With NIO day coming up in Jan, the stock price might see a good run up. Little concerned "sell the news" can follow soon after though.

PLTR - 10% (5k) - Up a lot but with lot of new contract announcements coming up, might see good upside

FSLY - 10% (5k) - Fastly's tech is cutting edge. The stock went down after they lost TikTok as their client, but seems to be a solid business with room for growth.

NET - 10% (5k) - A lot of websites use Cloudfare, I seriously think anyone with a portfolio in Cloud related stocks should hold this

ARKG - 10% (5k) - Cathie Wood + Genomics = Good investment 

What do you think?

Edit - Apologies for not including info about my current portfolio - 

NIO - 47%

PLTR - 22%

SQ - 19%

Check out where their stock was sitting before it got declined the first time due to the application process. It got destroyed after but has slowly been climbing back ever since. It would be easy to anticipate that if they were to get the approval it would surpass that point with ease and continue on. 
If you do not know what molluscum is check that out and see how many people it effects.

If your bullish, why?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell To Close on RH - Stop Limit Order - Limit Price/Stop Price/Min Credit I'm having trouble understanding the sell to close on RH.

On the RH UI when you Sell To Close a call option, it will say something like:

&#x200B;

|Contracts||
|:-|:-|
|Limit Price $0.85-0.95||
|Stop Price $0.90||
|Expires Good for Day||
|Min Credit||

1. What exactly is Limit Price, Stop Price, and the Min Credit?

* From my understanding, limit price is bare minimum price you want to sell your contracts for.
* From my understanding, stop price is a "safety" net in case the price of the stock drops below what you were expecting

Shouldn't stop price be a higher number? For example, the suggested stop price of $0.90 above... if the current stock price is 7 dollars, and I think that it will rise up to $30+ before my call expiration date, then I would put a stop price of $30 and for limit price, I would also just put $30. In this case, once the stock price hits $30, then the stop limit order becomes a sell limit order and would be sold if the shares are available for $30 or higher, is that right?

2) If I bought this contract for a premium of $1.60 and I believe the price of the stock will go up to $30+ in the future, then can I put a higher limit price than the suggest above, like 1.8 or would it get rejected? (i.e. $0.85 - $0.95)?

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I just did some more reading, but is the "Stop Price" the same thing as the "Ask" price i.e. the premium, which is why its so low in the example? If so, how do I use this to calculate the min price I want to sell the shares for, assuming my belief that it will go up to $30_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Post with resources on 'stock market fundamentals' deleted?

Happy investing at the end of 2020 Reddit! :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ r/stocks decided on my longterm portfolio and this is how it went I've been investing for around 5 years and wanted to make a fun experiment. I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/khdoae/what_are_your_guaranteed_growth_stock_buys_for/) about stock recommendations for the future and tried to look more like a beginner. Not saying 5 years means I am an expert or hella knowledgeable, but I know what I am doing.

The experiment was to let r/stocks decide what a new portfolio will look like and later compare it to 2 of my own portfolios that work independently. Every mention of a stock to buy received a vote in the portfolio, multiple mentions means multiple votes and the total of 100% is split across them based on their votes. Note that some comments could not be added due to availability and others were added due to frequent recommendations on other posts that asked for future growth stocks. The portfolio is meant for the future, meaning nothing that is liquidated in 2021.

Before I posted I expected trolls and a large tendency to TSLA, PLTR, PYPL, MSF, AAPL. Not because I think those are straight up good (also not saying they are bad), but I looked around before I decided to do this and those were quite common to be mentioned. Reality looked different.

The 2 portfolios r/stock-portfolio will compete against (these have been running since early to mid December so they have a time advantage, which over the course of a year should barely make a difference):

I am reposting it here to a bigger audience, with an added section to respond to some of the questions I received. I am hoping that by reposting on here, we can get more a discussion. I am not too familiar with reddit as I typically post on smaller value investing forums, and it is first time posting there. I plan to long in this company as I see the long term position of the company's growth in the health care sector. This is a minor position (5%) in what is a concentrated (10-15 company) portfolio.

**PFMT- Performant FinancialOverview:**PFMT is a technology-based provider of audit, recovery, payment accuracy, coordination of benefits (COB), and outsource services in the United States. PFMT analyze claims, identify, prevent and correct inaccurate payments. Using their proprietary analytics platform and industry expertise, PFMT aim to reduce losses on billions of dollars worth of improper healthcare payments, state/federal/and treasury tax delinquencies, defaulted student loans and other receivables. Primary customers include government commercial health plans, CMS, Blues plans, regional Insurers, private/commercial programs, etc that operate in complex and highly regulated environments that rely on PFMT's innovative and disruptive approach. Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years. These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.This is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.Historically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While "Other" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients. ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward. Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.

**Covid-19 Impact:**This year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.

**Healthcare Business:**The healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.Healthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:

Q3 2020= $17.6MQ2 2020= $14.6MQ1 2020= $17.5MQ4 2019=$14.3MQ3 2019= $10.8MQ2 2019= $9.3MQ1 2019= $9MQ4 2018= $9.9MQ3 2018= $6.6MQ2 2018= $6.1MQ1 2018= $3.5M

\[Figure 2: PFMT Healthcare Revenues\]([https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu](https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu))

**Macro:**The macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.**Competitors:**PFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach. Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \~\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach. Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.**Debt:**On Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement. ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95. The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.PFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.The current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.**Timing/Technicals:**As the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.**Valuation:**The timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation). Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA. Calculation below.EBITDA= $25.6MEnterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) = $85.7 MEV/EBITDA= 3.3XFully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s

Now lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis. COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates. Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.Healthcare IT Peer Trading Comp Table                        Mkt Cap  SHARES O/S           EV         EV/EBITDA

The market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate. Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.In the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.In the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/shareIn the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.Also, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.As we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT. These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**

**Part 2:**

$PFMT hit $1 by EOD yesterday, as much as I would like to think that the prior write-up was a catalyst for PFMTs recent performance, it is more likely driven by some significant and recent industry developments.  This will be a short follow up summarizing the recent event and why I think it is important to the underlying thesis. Also, I will try to respond to the some of the questions received last night. Thank you to all who have engaged me. Hopefully we can continue this constructive dialogue around this investment idea.

On Monday morning (Dec 21), HMSY (a direct competitor of PFMT) announced it had agreed to be acquired by Gainwell Technologies for $3.4B. Gainwell is owned by the private equity firm Veritas Capital. In March 2020, DXC Technologies announced the sale of their Government Healthcare business segment for $5B in cash to Veritas which renamed this new segment: Gainwell Technologies. Prior to acquiring this segment from DXC, this healthcare business was generating $1.5B in annual revenues, growing double digits year over year with 20% margins (inline with industry standard and PFMTs 2021 margin goal). The transaction values HMSY at 16-17X forward 2021 EV/EBITDA.  From what I gather, this is above most consensus estimates but still seems to be a fair price. A reminder that Veritas also acquired Cotiviti (COTV) in 2018 at a slightly lower valuation of 14-16X EV/EBITDA. The willingness to pay a premium relative to their COTV recent transaction indicates growing opportunity in the space.

Veritas intends on breaking up the various HMSY segments and redistributing them among its portfolio companies COTV and Gainwell. COTV will take on the payment integrity and population health management business while Gainwell will take on the Medicade, Coordination of benefits/third party liability services business. Strategically, Veritas is able to secure HMSY's valuable set of data assets in the Medicaid market, and gaining exposure to the potentially higher EBITDA in 2021 due to the positive recent Medicaid enrollment trend. However, HMSY has been under pressure for failing to deliver predictable results and underperformance in some segments (particularly their population health management business). This inherent volatility in the revenue model is a burden on these companies (including PFMT) as it masks longer term growth and margin expansion potential.

Though FTC concerns don’t appear to be an issue. It is uncertain to me what this new Veritas combination will mean for their Medicare RAC regions. As HMSY has one region and COTV has two. I believe there is a program limit of two regions per vendor. This could prove to be an obstacle for the new entity.  Also the inherent culture clash in executing large mergers typically leads to significant employee turnover and loss of talent. In such a niche industry, I would imagine the labor market is tight and any brain drain could hurt the new entity. In fact, a basic linkedin search of these companies indicates a recent influx of talent from large competitors into PFMT. If industry incumbents, particularly experienced sales people, are realizing PFMT has a superior platform relative to the large slow moving competition then this should be another positive signal reinforcing PFMTs trajectory. Discount this as anecdotal investigative evidence but I think it has merit.

The continuing theme of consolidation in this particular area of Healthcare IT highlights the large market opportunity across cost-containment and solutions services.

Recent transactions:

Access acquired by HMSY in 2018 at 11-12X EV/EBITDA

DXC HC segment acquired by Veritas/Gainwell

COTV acquired by Veritas at 14-15X

HMSY acquired by Veritas at 16-17X

&#x200B;

This all bodes well for PFMT, as it solidifies my view that this turnaround story is not being valued as an appropriate comp to its peers. If TODAY the market determines that HMSY is worth 16-17X EV/EBITDA, this supports my Base and Best Case Scenario of valuing PFMT using a 12X ($5.15/share) and 14X ($6/share) multiple, respectively (accounting for microcap nature and leverage by reducing the multiple by a few notches).  The recent price improvement in PFMT appears to be driven by a recognition of PFMT being undervalued on a comparable basis. Volumes have improved in the last few sessions but the stock is still extremely undervalued. Likely some retail investors accumulating entry positions. Imagine if a small fund of $100 AUM identifies this stock as an ideal investment, decides to initiate a small 200 basis point position. It would require 2-3M shares. The stock was up 20% today after trading only 1M shares, accumulating supply for a single fund position will require a significant movement in price. Given the current valuation, this opportunity could soon hit the radar screens of multiple funds. The recent string of transactions will continue to attract attention to this space. Sooner or later someone will start kicking the tires on PFMT...

Responses to recent questions and comments:

1. Is it possible that customers build/improve their internal tools to the point where they become threats to PFMT?

Good question. Customers may marginally improve their ability to audit claims internally but not to the point of being a threat. It's important to understand that the solutions/services offered by PFMT, HMSY, COTV, etc require technology- heavy platforms that require significant amount of resources (financial and intellectual) to develop, once developed there are minimal incremental costs for higher volumes. These types of commitments are not usually within the realm of possibilities among the customer base.  The ever-changing complexity around these types of industries makes in-house billing departments ill-equipped to maximize value relative to specialists like PFMT. An example to illustrate such complexity would be the ongoing changes in the International Classification of Disease codes (ICD). When the WHO decided to change the medical classification codes of ICD9 to ICD10, it increased the number of procedure codes from 13,000 to 68,000. This is just one example of the type of nuance that will always provide opportunity for specialist support from a PFMT.

2. Terms of the credit agreement and Why hasn’t management refinanced the Debt?

For anyone eager to learn more about the terms of the Credit Agreement, i would advise you read the latest 10k (link posted in my original report). The 10-k is helpful in clearly outlining all details.

I think management is working towards refinancing the debt. But these are not things that can be negotiated or arranged immediately. It is possible that management wants/needs to have a certain number of consistent quarter over quarter improvement before they can renegotiate terms. In the current interest rate environment and following their recent turnaround progress, this low hanging fruit should be picked soon enough.

&#x200B;

3.   Divesting legacy business?

I would not be surprised to see parts of the legacy business sold off as the focus turns toward the growing health care business. I will continue monitoring management discussion on next earnings call for any evidence to support this.

&#x200B;

4. PFMT is transitioning to focus on its healthcare business.

Some commentators have referred to PFMT as a pure-play student loans collection firm which would be a false description. Student loans do not account for a majority of their revenues and management has made it clear their focus has changed towards a constantly growing healthcare industry.

&#x200B;

5. Comparables mentioned are 100X larger than PFMT, why is that a fair comparison?

This is a reasonable observation. The answer to which is a function of numerous factors. The current market cap is significantly depressed as the popularity contest that IS the stock market is not identifying the value of this name. The stock was depressed further as a large holder just sold their 18% position, pushing the price near all-time lows. The huge gap in public market valuation is one of the reasons why this is a table pounding buy in my opinion. As this gap closes the difference in market cap will seem more acceptable.

Also, despite being small, the fact that PFMT is able to compete on the same level with these giants is a testament to its superior product and team: evidenced by their ability to secure two Medicare RAC region contracts (competing directly with COTV and HMSY), among other contacts won from incumbents.

6. What is the moat/"secret sauce"?

I am not a software engineer, nor do I have inner workings into PFMT's technology. Based on publicly available information, I can speculate that PFMT's disruptive technology refers its ability to differentiate itself over the competition. Competitors have been using a "one-size-fits-all approach" to their customers. PFMT uses their proprietary software to scrape data and yield higher rates of potential recoverable claims. Their solutions are more client-centric than the competition. As a smaller player they can be nimble, providing customized solutions to fulfill each client’s needs. For this reason they continue to be rewarded with new contracts taken from large incumbents. See the recent presentations (on their website) for quantitative case study examples.

These contracts are difficult to win, have long term time horizons.  The technology to service customers is unique and initially capital intensive to establish. Barriers to entry are significant.

&#x200B;

I've been looking at $GPC, which owns auto-parts stores such as NAPA, for quite a while as they are a dividend kind with 63 years of dividend growth and seem to have an incredibly steady business. However, I am concerned that the rise in electric vehicles could create a different atmosphere for DIY auto-maintenance and purchasing of parts. Without the need for so many fluids and small parts that are frequently replaced in combustion engines, will a company like this be able to survive in the future? Will the parts needed be as large and bulky? If not, could they easily be taken over by a company such as Amazon?

&#x200B;

I checked their investor relations page, but there doesn't seem to be any information on this moving forward. I have a strong conviction that electric vehicles are the future, and I believe that there is going to need to be a change in the maintenance atmosphere to reflect this. Furthermore, I believe a strong play into the maintenance space could be good as it isn't betting on the winner of the sector, but rather that the sector wins.

Does anyone have any thoughts or experiences they'd like to share on this? I hope to have a productive discussion!

Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a possible short/put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.

* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:

1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.
2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.
3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.

* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.  

   * Snow CEO options based pay is $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this
* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.  

   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market
   * From their S1, AVG PRICE is $6.70!
      * As of July 31, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase 72,228,820 shares of our Class B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $6.70 per share under our 2012 Plan.
* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.
* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.
*  I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. I have 7 contracts in each.

**TLDR:** SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.

(Assuming you buy on January 1 and sell on February 1.) You can only choose one ticker and it must be a single stock. Feel free to explain your choice if you want.

I feel like these company’s could be more trusted when it comes to production and sales of these vehicles.

Will it affect the amount I of financial aid I receive? My parents are middle class and make about 50,000 a year. I also don’t plan on selling any stocks. I want to hold on to them for 6-7 years minimum and by that time, I’ll be done with college. So will it affect my FAFSA if I don’t sell the stocks? Any help is appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let’s talk tech Alright so the buzz in tech continues to be amazon, google, Apple, Tesla, etc. for the casual or entry level investor these are too high typically. So what’s the next best thing? Buying the companies that they buy/invest in.

1st pick: Microvision is a corporation that creates technology applicable to the autonomous vehicle sector which all of the above mentioned are drooling over to get a piece of their tech. The top 5 likely to buy them out are 1. Microsoft 2. Ford 3. Tesla 4. Toyota and 5. Google with Apple in the mix as well. Their tech is some of the best in the business and today is the time to get in if you couldn’t have earlier. There was an article recently published by someone who is notorious for shorting stocks bad mouthing them, but I’ve kept a solid stream of investing in them as they continue to grow.

Frsx- Foresight autonomous holdings is my next pick. Having just cracked the penny stock ceiling of $3 I believe their capabilities will continue to climb as well. The European Union just gave them a grant of 1 million dollars with their 2020 sales being below 500k. If the European Union is investing in them there is clearly potential there. Their projected sales for 2021 are 2.99M and 2022 13.89M get in while you can for cheap. Because like the above mentioned people will be fighting over this tech in 3 years. My last pick may surprise you: NLS Nautilus- so many people are raving over the peloton with the closing of gyms etc. NLS has recently released a boxflex treadmill with incredible capabilities and new tech, as well as the Nautilus Bike. With a target price of 31 as the average 40 on the high end, this is an easy decision for those trying to turn 22/share into 32/share relatively quickly. There are more products on the horizon for this company so again get in while you can.

I'm looking to invest my gains in a smaller tech company with more upside. Two that I've been tracking are A10 Networks and Magnite.

Magnite is a service that facilitates buying and selling of online advertising space. It seems very relevant right now and they should have significant demand. However, others have thought the same and they're up 270% this year and 62% in just the past week. Market cap is about $3.6B.

A10 Networks sells datacenter management applications. I think highly relavant in these times with more remote work and as companies move to the cloud. They're up 45% over the past year and 17% over the past week. They're market cap is $$787M. And, they're profitable.

I think Magnite is a more compelling company, but I'm worried about where the stock price can go after the growth it's seen in the past year. A10 looks more compelling to me. Stock price has not skyrocketed over the past year and they have a lower market cap. I'd think they'd have more room to grow.

Any opinions on these A10 or Magnite?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Action Holdings Hey Everyone, 

New investors here - I own a few hundred dollars worth of Hexo and today I noticed that on the 23rd they are going to go through a corporate consolidating and after I’ll be able to action my holdings. What does action my holdings mean? 

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Case for $GOLD as a Hedge Rather Than Buying Puts $GOLD is Barrick corporation. They produce 11M0z of gold and 400KT of copper per annum. They are the second largest gold producer and in the top 15 for copper production

The two pillars of owning $GOLD are:

1. inflation hedge
2. bad news hedge
3. **liquidity bubble implies money flow into funds rather than out of the system! Hence, why puts are irrelevant in a liquidity bubble.**

The reason you should buy them as a hedge are because they produce a 400KT of copper, so their cost of production of gold is the lowest in the industry.

In fact, last quarter @ 3.00 /lb copper and 1900/oz gold they had a free cash flow of 1.2 Billion USD in 1 quarter!

Copper has gone up to 3.50/lb and expect to hit 4.00 going forward because of the EV boom.

Other than their FCF, what makes $GOLD a compelling call buy is that gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and risk. But now we have a liquidity bubble, so fund of flows will eventually move into gold.

Currently the fund of flows are QQQ > IWM growth into value. Eventually, they'll move from value into inflation hedges (commodities/mining stock and gold). This is why you want to buy $GOLD LEAP as a hedge and start positioning into it before the market makers (MM).

Right now, everyone is owning EV or ARKG but when that changes, they'll look for alternatives, but with stock prices at an All Time High, you'll likely see them chase gold by the middle of 2021._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nickel For Your Thoughts Lithium is found in the brine of salt flats of Chile, or in a hard rock called spodumene, found in Australia and elsewhere.

Let’s see what Celgene and Gilead share in common.

**Hitting 52-week lows** \- *check*

**Down 30% from intra-year highs** – *check*

**CEO is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors** \- *check*

**Company spent billions on acquisitions in the last year(s)** – *check*

Celgene went on a buying spree prior to the merger. In 2018 they spent billions on [Juno Therapeutics](https://www.celgene.com/newsroom/cellular-immunotherapies/celgene-corporation-to-acquire-juno-therapeutics-inc/) and [IMPACT Biomedicines](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180107005114/en/Celgene-to-Acquire-Impact-Biomedicines-Adding-Fedratinib-to-Its-Pipeline-of-Novel-Therapies-for-Hematologic-Malignancies). 

Gilead spent more than 30 billion on buying up companies in 2019 and 2020. You can see a detailed list of a Gilead’s acquisitions in [Part 1](https://www.griproom.com/fun/it-looks-like-gilead-is-about-to-merge-with-roche), and how each one relates to Roche (the company that is probably trying to buy Gilead.)

You might be thinking, okay but they couldn’t have been planning this merger for years, right? That would be crazy.

Nope. That’s exactly what they did.

Celgene management knew this was coming, because they’d been organizing it.

It seems this merger had been planned for more than a year. So if you’re expecting the management of Gilead to come out and defend the stock price…don’t.

It didn’t happen with Celgene and it isn’t happening with Gilead.

- One stock ticker per parent level comment. Explanation is optional.

- the number of upvotes a parent level comment gets will determine the weight of that stock.

- Tickers with 1 or fewer upvotes will not be counted.

- Tickers that receive multiple parent level comments will only have the comment with the highest number of upvotes counted.

- No options trading

- I won't buy fractional shares so no tickers over $1000 will be possible. Also, I will have to do some rounding when I make the actual purchase.

I will make the buys on January 4th 2021 and maybe sell on January 5th 2022.

Hello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.

We also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.

But we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.

[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.

So, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don’t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn’t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it’s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn’t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don’t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn’t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don’t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.

Meanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.

We also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.

And one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are there any Canadians here swing trading stocks in their TFSA? I just recently found out that CRA guidelines for the TFSA technically forbid frequent trading. The rules are somewhat vague and, from what I’ve read on other forums, they seem to be largely in place to catch professional traders who have amassed several hundreds of thousands of dollars in their TFSA. I’m currently below $50k and have been making a few transactions (buy/sell) every week. My gains this year have been fairly respectable but not eyebrow-raising.

My way of thinking was that british companies will most likely struggle because it's harder for them to access other markets and competitors will profit from the situation. Problem is i couldn't really find any articles or suggestions in that direction.

I was curious if any of you had any thoughts on how the market will react to Trump's announcement that he might blow up the stimulus talks if there is not a larger check.

My understanding is that there was a brief dip in the market, per Reuters, but that it rebounded quickly.

I don't know why this is. Maybe 1) they don't think Trump is sincere and ultimately think he's bluffing, 2) they think he is sincere and larger stimulus checks will prompt more consumption, 3) the 900 billion stimulus is not as impactful on the market as some suggest to begin with.

I am not an expert on this. I imagine Trump causes some instability with these last-minute changes. Does Wall Street want stimulus checks for people to promote consumption? Is that likely to benefit the economy and provide more profit to traders?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a correlation between federal interest rates and the performance of growth and value stocks? I looked at the performance of the  VUG (Vanguard Growth ETF) and VTV (Vanguard Value ETF) over the past 16 years, and the only times Value has given a better yield than Growth is between 2004 and 2008, where interest rates were around 5%. However, when interest rates were 0%, Growth has performed better over value tremendously.

If you had invested your money in VUG instead of VTV 10 years ago where the interest rates for the majority of the decade was 0%, you would have made 190% more money.

The Feds are saying they want to keep interest rates at 0% through 2022. 

With this in mind, why should people invest in value companies at this point? The dividends that value companies give compared to growth companies is a slap in the face compared to their rates of return.

Revenues expected to be ~170% growth next quarter. 

Good company. Solid mgmt team._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quantumscape, Inflation, and Legacy Auto Makers Not sure if everyone has been following this, but Quantumscape (QS) just mooned today and yesterday after already exploding in previous weeks. Current share price is $130~ after being 70 two days ago and debuting at ~10 only a few weeks ago. Meteoric to say the least.

Now the company has real potential. They’re offering a supposedly revolutionary solid state battery that could theoretically revolutionize whole industries (auto, etc). They also have institutional backing from big names like VW and Bill Gates. I bought in on the SPAC and took profits (in retrospect) far too early). Did additional DD at a certain point and realized they only had what amounts to a working prototype. Industrial production hasn’t scaled, and they are still years away from a functional battery. This means zero revenues for the foreseeable future. Ultimately bought back in yesterday after seeing continued growth, and took profits today after big returns. No ragrets

Today’s surge seemed to be based on a (likely misplaced) believe that Apple’s newly announced auto ambitions could be based on QS tech. Or AAPL notwithstanding, there seems to be a belief that the new tech once operationalized will be groundbreaking. It very well might be. However I just read that with current valuation, QS is valued as the second largest automotive company worldwide, with the first being Tesla.

Obviously there’s lots of speculation going on with both these companies. Atm I think profit taking is justified, and it’s hard to justify buying into either company with current prices. That being said, it’s also nearly impossible to price for a black swan event/bold and brilliant new innovation.

I do buy into the narrative that new EV/ESG companies can and maybe should be priced as technology companies rather than automotive ones. If QS really has the equivalent of the lightbulb in 1900 then almost any share price is justified. They’ll be everywhere in 5 years, future revenue discount be damned. But it’s still hard to stomach the valuation.

I agree the market is frothy, and I’m very worried about a big correction. Scary to see such unproven companies upvaluing big proven names like Ford and others. But isn’t it also possible we’re in a dynamic inflationary event? Perhaps GAAP and broader standards have yet to correct to new norms and broader investor sentiments in an age when surging retail investment means there is more easy money in the market than ever. I am not an expert, so I could be wrong on the last. But is it possible that easy spending by governments worldwide is flooding capital markets, while people are still trapped at home unable to spend? Couldn’t this mean that excess liquidity is flooding equity markets at a time when people have more access than ever? Couldn’t this mean that trendy, forward looking “meme stocks” are the earliest beneficiaries of new higher inflationary valuations across the market? If this is the case, couldn’t it also be the case that the laggard blue chip standards like Ford and others are due for enormous valuation growth as their pricing calibrates to new liquidity structures and market openness?

Again, I am not an expert. I think the macroeconomic situation worldwide is out of sync with markets reaching new highs. I don’t think valuations that give a near zero discount to future revenues are reasonable. But in a fiat currency global economy, value is based on expected return on growth of human society. If human society has more investors investing more money than ever, and investor sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, isn’t it possible we’re entering a new paradigm, and markets have yet to correct. Fully expect this post will sound ludicrous after the inevitable correction. I know it reeks of “stonks only go up”, and I am infinitely handicapped by my inexperience and the extent of my undergraduate economics education. Please be kind.

I had been browsing around the sub for a while, but I never bothered really posting, much less joining the sub. I had been browsing on WSB and obviously, the entire discussion about GME caught my eye.

Don’t get me wrong. These decisions are always looking dangerous and scary to me. I’m a student with not a lot to invest, and every penny  that can realistically make me a profit, is amazing to me. I’m just looking to build up a successful future for not only me, but my family. 

I had been trying to register into websites, researching a bit into my legal requirements. Being a full-time student in a foreign country (UK), things seemed quite tough to me. The country specifically asks me for Tax-ID, when I can’t provide it. Having my other country’s Tax-ID, I thought it’d work just fine, but since I had created a my personal bank account (REVOLUT) in the foreign country, it specifically required the foreign country’s TID. I’m terribly confused at this, and don’t know how to advance about it. I’ve questioned if the websites could shut my account for this same reason, leaving all the money I had in there, gone. 

Parents had told me that when you look at it that way, it doesn’t seem fun enough to do anymore, and I agree. The uncertainty of the future of my account, doesn’t seem appealing to me, if I were to ever create one.


I know I seem like I haven’t done much research about my situation, but the information I receive or inquire about is too vague, and makes me doubt if I should make an account or not.

Is this stock even worth buying or is it a complete waste?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What should my ETF portfolio look like at my age? (late 20's). At the beginning of this year I began building out a portfolio with the following holdings.   


VAB (Vanguard Aggregate Bond Index)   
VCN (Vanguard All Cap Canadian Index Fund)   
VUN (Vanguard Total US Market ETF)   
XEC (Emerging Markets ETF)   
XEF (International Markets ETF)   


I started off with a more balanced holdings but I've adjusted my equity/bond ratio to be roughly 73%/27% approx. That means we're looking at the following.   


VAB - 27%  
VCN - 26%  
VUN - 25%   
XEC: 11%  
XEF: 10% or the rest.   


I originally bought the bonds just as part of diversification but I'm not so certain if I need to hold onto such a large percentage. My aim is to cut down to 80%/20% as a target.

Let it ride and forget or jump ship?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Microsoft (MSFT) Could Hit $300 in 2021 Dow component Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) posted an all-time high at $232.86 in September and eased into a triangular trading range that has been working off extremely overbought technical readings through time rather than price. That exercise may have now entered the final stages, raising the odds for a 2021 breakout that signals another year of superior returns and a potential trip up to the $300 level.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Microsoft stock has doubled in price since the end of 2018.

Institutional investors have been loading up on the stock in the fourth quarter

The stock could post superior returns for the third year in a row in 2021.

A symmetrical triangle breakout may have to wait for January tax-selling pressure to ease.

Bought in before the last earnings release and the stock tanked shortly after. Been bag holding for a month. With vaccines coming out and a generally positive outlook for COVID in the future, I just don't see how ZM can go back to pre-vaccine highs. Will ZM slowly bleed and fade into irrelevance? There are rumors they may look to acquire some other companies but those are rumors so far._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BLBD - Electric School Bus Play Hey everyone, super short DD. I came across this company Bluebird (Ticker BLBD). This is a legacy bus maker with strong connections to school districts across the US that reported fairly strong earnings (check them out on seeking alpha, don’t have a link for you). They recently announced they were expanding production capacity to 1000 electric buses to meet growing demand. They most recently sold 158 electric school buses this year and announced on call they were off to a great fiscal 2021 with 80 orders in backlog. They also noted they have been delivering electric zero emissions buses for over two years now and they are not a startup. They have pretty strong cash flow, they already service many school districts not only with buses but parts as well. I am thinking with 1000 electric buses coming in this environment (Environment - where companies that have delivered nothing in electric vehicle  space are worth 10-15b+). At a measly 450m market cap this company is well positioned and could definitely see multiple expansion and is just fundamentally undervalued (electric vehicle company with p/e? Weird to even talk about that when valuing these companies). I can’t imagine this company is not going out of their way to produce expand electric school bus production if there is not demand, places like California are already going all electric. Chart looks really clean. 

Con...pretty high debt..but they make money and are a legit company. 

Always just my opinion, but love to share! Not financial advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do I buy shares in a company at their original IPO price? Many IPOs have the potential to have big gains, but also big losses. If I wanted to buy a stock at the original prices banks value the shares at how do I do it? For example, I wanted to buy ABNB at the IPO price they originally had, which was $68, but on the first day, it doubled quickly and is no longer a very good option.

(Still down ~40% from ATH) 1. Altria has been in the best performing stocks for the past 20 years. Despite the major 40% drop from 2017: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022716/5-best-performing-stocks-last-20-years-gmcr-celg.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022716/5-best-performing-stocks-last-20-years-gmcr-celg.asp)
2. Everyone is currently piling into tech and healthcare right now. Whereas this is more of a contrarian investment. Interestingly the highest returns tend to come from out of favor sectors. 
3. They're responsible for selling tobacco (Marlboro cigarettes), and they currently have plans on getting into the marijuana industry through their 45 percent stake in Cronos Group.
4. Vice stocks will still be around forever. I honestly don't think people are going to suddenly stop consuming tobacco, no matter what the current health trends of today are. Tobacco is out of favor but if we do find a treatment for the negative health consequences of smoking via CRISPR therapy, there will probably be fewer negative views on tobacco. 

Lastly here's an interesting post I read from another topic:

"Look at the best performing stock since 1968: Altria. 1 dollar invested back then would have turned into over 6000 dollars with dividends reinvested. Why? Because the reality of the company's earnings have consistently been better than people expected. All the pessimism over smoking declines and aversion to the industry has kept share prices low relative to earnings for long periods of time."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Index Fund for Roth IRA? 20 y/o I just got a Roth IRA and put my savings of $6000 (the max) into the account.

Alongside ARC funds, ICLN is another ETF which seems to be performing well, so again I’m stuck. I’m interested to know if anyone else is currently invested in any of these funds or planning too, and why they chose to invest in them in the first place ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Solar stocks are going crazy. They deserve a discussion. The solar industry, as soon as in the past month (not to mention this entire year), has absolutely been going to the moon. CSIQ has now had 3 consecutive days gaining 8%+, two of those days gaining 11%. SPWR finished at 12% today and doubled over the past 2 months. ENPH got the credit it deserved from big-name institutions and finished up 30% in the past week, again doubling in the past two months.

That's not to say that solar hasn't had a phenomenal year in general either. RUN, ENPH, SPWR, PLUG, etc. are all examples of companies that have seen 3, 4, 5, even 9x growth this year. What's more, many of them (SPWR, CSIQ) still have extremely stomache-able fundamentals. 

A large portion of this growth is under Trump, who was obviously not a proponent of green energy. I take this to mean that since solar can show astronomical growth in adversity, it could yield amazing growth under the right conditions. 

What solar stocks do you all think are holes-in-one? Why? Where do you think the industry is going in 2021? What upsides/downsides are people not talking about? If people invest now are they catching the tail-end of a fluke, or is this just the beginning?

Personally, I'm invested in CSIQ, ENPH, SPWR, and QCLN. They've all worked like magic in my portfolio. I'd like to hear what you guys are invested in with the green energy space.

Wondering about your portfolios!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DE.VN Decisive Dividend Corp Could Possibly Be Introducing a 18% Yield. Currently the stock is trading at a %50 discount since pre-covid levels. The funny thing is the company managed to increase revenue, profit and reduce debt substantially in the past three quarters. Before they were paying a 36 cent yearly dividend with a 4 year track record of payment, it was temporarily discontinued to preserve cash on hand for new acquisitions and reduce debt due to economic uncertainty. This led to what I believe to be a panic selloff alongside the market crash as all this did was significantly increase the company's financial strength.

I managed to get in contact with a director and received notice that the stocks dividend should be returning in early 2021, this is a major bull catalyst if its anything like its 36 cent past dividend which is a 18% yield with the stock currently sitting at $2. Also I have noticed massive amounts of insider purchasing of shares which is reaffirming that the dividend will in fact be returning, odds are this dividend could double the current share prices so you could collect the growth and dividend payment.

Another bullish catalyst I have noticed is that their primary subsidiary (fireplaces) have had a record breaking year for installations and sales and google trends for searches of fireplaces can confirm this going into q4. Fireplace sales only peak in the winter so its likely to only significantly show in their most recent earnings report. Their other subsidiaries are doing quite good as well, with the exception of their oil rig part manufacturing subsidiary which only mildly fell below past revenue. I would think this would also see a spike since all the rigs will need to be fixed and maintained again now that they are being used for the first time in a while. In the end their net profit is gonna be pretty close to 17 Million this year pre-subtractions for taxes + debt interest which equate to about only 170k, which is pretty darn good for their 24 million dollar market cap.

Let alone their pretty decent business model that minimizes excessive risk, this company has pretty good long term growth projections. Here is their investor presentation if you would like to read up on more details.
