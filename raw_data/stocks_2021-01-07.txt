After seeing TSLA land on Mars today when it crossed the $800 mark, I got a little worried. I had a weird feeling in my gut. I knew the next stop would be Jupiter, I just... couldn’t help but feel like ”we had arrived”.

So after thinking about it long and hard, going back and forth, I decided to cash out and get off this reusable masterpiece of a rocketship. It had taken me and my SO safely from Earth to Mars and it was time to get off.

The money we made from TSLA helped us make a down payment on our first apartment, so it went to good use. 

Selling TSLA felt bitter sweet as I love this company, I have a man crush on Papa Musk and I was planning initially to hold my dear TSLA shares “forever”. However, I’m forever grateful to this company as it made buying an apartment possible for me. Believing in it paid off.

Thank you Elon. Thank you TSLA. ❤️

Edit: Thank you guys for all the comments! It is crazy how emotionally attached you can get to a stock. I’ve just spent countless hours studying this company and Elon. I believed in it when so many said I was crazy (or thought it). Elon is a true visionary and I truly believe TSLA is going to continue on its path to greatness.

Also, I wasn’t trying to time the top at all. It’s near impossible to do anyway. I just saw an opportunity, went with my gut feeling and seized it.

Edit 2: I was made aware by e fellow investor that in the US it’s called a condo and not an apartment. I understand if that was confusing! I’m from Europe and here apartments are both for sale and for rent._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 165.3% return from subreddit sentiment analysis in 2020.

# Process

I posted this strategy on Quantopian and Quantconnect a couple months ago but thought y'all might like it.

This algorithm searches this subreddit looking for posts related to the stocks SPCE, LULU, CCL, and SDC (these stocks are popular there). Then it conducts a sentiment analysis of the comments in the identified post and stores the values in a data frame. The sentiment analysis is done with this code: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0)

Stocks are ranked by those most popular to least popular, and then automatically bought in proportion to their relative popularity (or sold in proportion to their relative un-popularity).

Retail investor participation in the market is at an [all-time high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-investor-exposure-to-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-td-ameritrade-2018-01-08), and there are plenty of simple stock analysis tools to help small investors make informed decisions. If the general sentiment from retail investors is up, then they could be purchasing the underlying equity.

Here are the links to the [csv file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qydhy62v08tw4em/Reddit_Sentiment_Equity.csv?dl=0) generated from the [Reddit sentiment analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0) program.

# Results

After just a few months: $19k, 9% max drop. I recognize this is too short a time to know if this is a good long-term strategy. Turns out the wild hive mind over there either has blessed foresight or more likely is just great at creating momentum. Happy with the gains, and just a disclaimer that obviously this needs more backtesting and isn't a "get rich quick" strategy. Had fun though.

# Algo-trading vs Algo-investing vs Traditional

The distinctions are pretty clear here: algo-trading is short-term and often speculative, algo-investing is longer-term, rules-based, and includes everything from the S&P 500 to long-term indicators, index funds, Boglehead 3-funds, and so on - all computer automated. Traditional is either but human-run.

I personally automate my entire portfolio, from index funds, to my own automated digital coin 3-fund, automated hedge fund stock pick follower, and have had a great deal of success doing this. Happy to share more on this if others are interested. Edit: since some asked how to do this, [www.getquantbase.com](https://www.getquantbase.com) is a site that has these algo-investors already set up and ready to use!

Where does this community tend to stand on these? Success stories with algo-trading / algo-investing or with traditional? What experience have you had with them? I can answer questions on these and would love to hear others thoughts. Cheers_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The portfolio ive been building for the past year As the title states.

Admittedly there doesn’t seem to have been a mainstream stock quite as hot as TSLA recently. 

Combining futuristic technology, mainstream popularity and a visionary leader, which companies do you think have the potential to create the next world’s richest man?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA...g holers? I don't think so Ill be up front about 2 things, i own 60 shares of BABA (bought both "dips at 280 and 230") and also I am not nearly as experienced as some people on here.

But one thing i can do is research, and have patience. All the silly quotes that you read on here, i think the absolute best one is time in the market > timing the market. 

Ive done a bunch of research on BABA and I think that i share many opinions with others on here and its just....wait. Don't sell and just hold on. Its pretty unlikely that they get delisted in the NYSE just because of the amount of money thats invested. You can always count on one thing, you can follow the money. The money showed a Biden victory back in sept/oct, and it shows BABA will at some point come back up. After reading several things on them i took a few things away and wanted to share them or discuss them.

" In its most recent quarter, Alibaba's revenue jumped 30% to $22.9 billion, and adjusted operating income rose 44% to $4.4 billion, showing the company's enviable profit margins. Additionally, its cloud-computing division saw 60% revenue growth in the quarter to $2.2 billion. Based on those numbers, Alibaba would likely be worth double or even triple what it is today if it were an American company. "

" The lesson for Alibaba investors, therefore, seems to be that there are risks from the CCP's current actions against Ma and the company, but the investor response seems overblown. Alibaba is a leading tech giant in a country set to become the world's biggest economy in the next decade, but it's being valued as a stodgy company in a slow-growth industry. That looks like a mistake. Investors may want to take advantage of the current discount. "

So im always open for a discussion but my best advice is to just buy more if you can afford it but hold strong. Scared money dont make money!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shopify Removes Donald Trumps Stores, What Do Investors Think of This Move? So Shopify today removed Donald Trump's stores from the Shopify platform. As someone who uses Shopify for my business as well as an investor in Shopify I'm not a huge fan of this move.

This is also a change in the companies stance as previously the Shopify CEO said it's not his place to make moral judgements about who can and can't have a store. It's also important to point out Trump love him or hate him didn't violate Shopify TOS.

A big discussion in the world of eCommerce ie Shopify users and customers is owning your platform ie building your own website vs leasing ie something like Shopify or BigCommerce. While the movement is to a leased model hence Shopify's success, there is something to be said for not being reliant on a third parties rules or decisions which is exactly what happenned here.

Anyone running a business which is in the very least controversial will find this troubling that Shopify if they disagree with your politics, your niche, your products, your actions could take you down.

Generally speaking I think this will go over pretty smoothly as everyone hates Trump and the media isn't gonna take up on this issue but as a Shopify user and investor I find this troubling._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best call option for ~$1000?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Location disadvantage in picking stocks This might be a concern of a few, however, I would like to hear your opinion guys.

Almost every company that later booms along with the stock is from US. I suppose citizens here have a certain advantage, since they can see the companies in action and watch heir products upsurge and plummet and act accordingly with their stocks. This might not be the case for, let's say, Europeans.

An old example might be Hanes "L'eggs". After it hit the shelves it was a success amongst women. You could see your spouse bulk buying them and then buy into the stock after research. Whilst outside US you might have gotten a piece of a pie only after a good upsurge in the stock price.

I’ve been looking into this recently and reading 30+ articles a day and I’ve heard a lot of talk about stock market crashes in January and April 2021 and much worse crashes in 2022. I’m very bullish overall but the lack of optimism in general is slightly worrying. So I just want to get some people’s thoughts on this to see if it’s just talk or there is some truth to this. My biggest concern out of all of this is if the stock market will even recover/how long the supposedly “bigger” crashes will last because I’ve even read a few articles saying that our economy is completely dead. That right now it’s just the government supporting the banks which support the zombie companies that aren’t even pulling a profit.

NVIDIA_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Is a 1 fund portfolio the best option? I'm 20 and I've been trying to determine what asset allocation I should use for my Roth IRA. I currently use the 3 fund portfolio popularized by Bogleheads (80% total US stock index, 10% total international stock index, 10% US bond index). However, I was recently backtesting my portfolio and was surprised to find that investing 100% in the total US stock market yielded [considerably higher results](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=6000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=6000&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTSMX&allocation1_1=80&allocation1_2=80&allocation1_3=100&symbol2=VGTSX&allocation2_1=10&allocation2_2=20&symbol3=VBMFX&allocation3_1=10). Over a 24 year period (1996-2020) the results were as follows:

Three Fund (80/10/10): **$622,725**

Two Fund / Equity Only (80/20/0): **$623,357**

One Fund / US Only (100/0/0): **$694,082**

I know that past performance doesn't necessarily equate to future gains, but a $71,000 difference in performance over 24 years is substantial. Given that I likely wont retire for another 40+ years, this could mean missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars.

I was also surprised to see that the max drawdowns for these portfolios were relatively similar (between 47-52%), which tells me that the floor for an equity-heavy 3-fund portfolio is not as high as I expected.

I know no one has a crystal ball, but is this a convincing argument for a One Fund portfolio or is there something else I am missing?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Questrade/CRA say ARGGD (Aston Martin) doesn't qualify for a TFSA... why the hell not? I bought Aston Martin when it was under a different ticker (i believe it was ARGGY), which questrade executed. About three weeks later, it did a reverse-split (20:1) and changed ticker symbols to ARGGD. Then about two weeks later I got an email from questrade saying that the stock is no longer considered a qualified TFSA investment.

The question is, why was it qualified before changing tickers, and what about changing tickers makes it so that it no longer qualifies? 

Typically if I try to execute a buy in Questrade that does not qualify, it automatically prevents me from doing so. According to the email I have to sell it off NOW otherwise I'll face a penalty (and of course it is down today to $24/share and was at $27/share a few days ago...)

Is this something I can even argue/appeal, or would it be best to just sell and move on?

my Online Broker (Flatex) removed some of there promoted ETFs, so unfortunately one of my ETFs is no longer free as a saving plan. It's not much, like 1,5€/month, but still I don't want to "waste" money. So I searched for alternatives and found one but I don't really know if its worth it. I invest 150€/month into this ETF so the 1,5€ would be 1%.  
Main differentes are:  
Old (**IE00BJ0KDQ92**)--> TER : 0,19% p.a.,  1%(1,5/150) + 0,2% ATC = 1,2%/order  
New (**LU0274208692**) --> TER : 0,45% p.a., 0% + 0.11% ATC = 0.11%/order

I’m reading Valero’s (VLO) Q3 earnings release during which they report a -$464 million net loss in income and the WTI was at around $40 at that time. They also say that due to COVID-19, their inventory levels decreased throughout the first 9 months of 2020 and that they expect inventory levels on 12/31/2020 to remain below 12/31/2019 levels. Currently the WTI is trading around $50–a 25% increase. What I’m asking is: because VLO’s inventory levels have vastly decreased while the WTI has increased nearly 25%, will this significantly hurt profit margins in the near future? I take it that since VLO does not engage in any oil exploration or drilling, they have nothing to gain and everything to lose from the oil prices recovering and moving up after the crash.

-Aurinia Pharmaceuticals has one of the most important milestones in its history in a few weeks.

-Next January 22, 2021 is the PDUFA where the FDA will decide the approval of the candidate drug Voclosporin.

-Voclosporin approval by the FDA is almost assured (estimated at 95% chance of approval) thanks to the very good phase III trial data presented last December 2019.

-Estimates of the potential revenues that Voclosporin could generate worldwide once approved range from $1.5B to $3B per year.


They also have around $400+ mill in cash on hand with great leadership.

However what can be seen is a SIGNIFICANT increase in borrowings over the last couple of years with little to show for it when compared alongside takings.

Share price is currently at a level last seen mid 2018, after which it seemed to decline quite rapidly. Recovery following the COVID slump in March of this year allowed it to return to that 2018 level.

I'm looking at this from a long-term investment perspective, but I'm on the fence about whether the public will continue showing an interest in Kingfisher's companies when things eventually return to normal, or if I've missed the boat on buying them in March when they were incredibly cheap and selling now before the decline continues as it did prior to COVID.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Technical Analysis Series 1: Candlesticks, what are they and how do I use them? Hey Internet,

This post is the first part in a series I will be doing outlining some of the basic tools, tips, and techniques I use to conduct technical analysis on charts.

I figured that the best place to start is at the beginning, so the title of today's post is: "Candlesticks, what are they and how do I use them?"

In this post I will present some of the basic elements of candle sticks, a few noteworthy candle stick formations, and introduce some other relevant terminology. In addition, this post will be helpful in generally explaining how to read a chart at a very basic level.

A candlestick tells the story of the price action for the asset during the relevant timeframe you have selected for your chart.

While they may not look like much to the untrained eye, markets are run off of human emotion, primarily fear and greed. Candlesticks can give valuable insight into what the mood of the market was during a given timeframe.

**Why Candlesticks vs other types of Charts?**

* There are plenty of valid ways to look at historical price data for assets:
   * bar charts
   * line charts
   * heikin-ashi charts
* The reasons I prefer candlesticks are:
   * can easily visually see where the candle opened
   * can easily visually see where the candle closed
   * can easily visually see where the candle "wicked" up or down to and was rejected from
      * Being able to easily identify these data points allows for a technical trader to more quickly assess the relevant info required for assessing risk and putting on trades.

**Here is a 1 week ("1W") timeframe ("TF") chart of Starbucks:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/gmzRPrY](https://imgur.com/gallery/gmzRPrY)

**As explained in the graphic:**

* The asset is generally listed in the top left of the chart followed by the TF of the candles on the chart.
   * Since this is a 1W TF chart of Starbucks that means that each red or green candle on the chart represents 1 week of price action.
      * Candle periods are broken into what is considered high TF, medium TF, and low TF.
* The general rule of thumb is that looking at a high TF candle chart reduces the risks of getting "faked out" by bull traps, bear traps, or otherwise sideways choppy action (future posts will touch on what these are if you'd like to know more).
* Essentially, it would take much more sustained application of capital to lay such a trap for a 1 week period vs. a 1 hour period. Therefore, high TF charts are much more reliable for longer term analysis. The downside to high TF candles though is that they are obviously less responsive to explosive and sudden price action brought on by a catalyst or other outside event.  

   * On equities the TF breakdown is generally:
      * High TF: 12 month candles, 6 month candles, 3 month candles, 1 month candles, 2 week candles, and 1 week candles
      * Medium TF: 3 day candles, 2 day candles, and 1 day candles
      * Low TF: 4 hour candles, 2 hour/90 minute candles, 1 hour candles, 30 minute candles, 15 minute candles
   * Technical traders will run all types of TF's on candles and these are just some of the most common examples. Furthermore , the most relevant or "favorite" TF's of technical traders will change as algorithms are adjusted across the market, thereby requiring the trader to adjust as relevant market data is analyzed.

**Here is another shot of the 1W TF chart of Starbucks with some additional info to cover candle stick bodies and wicks:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/IUNET9x](https://imgur.com/gallery/IUNET9x)

**As explained in the graphic:**

* The body of the candle is the solid portion of each candle.
   * The body contains the price range between the Open and Close of the asset.
      * A red candle has the Open at the top of the body and the close at the bottom of the body.
      * A green candle has the Open at the bottom of the body and the close at the top of the body.
   * The lines sticking out of the top and bottom of the candle body are the wicks for the candle and represent the High and Low for the TF.

The importance of Open and Close for a candle will be further expanded upon in later posts, but the short version is that open and closing prices for an asset are extremely important for "confirmation trading." This is a style of technical trading where one waits for a candle to confirm (open, or even open and close) over (or under) a critical resistance level before entering a position. This is a more conservative technical trading style, but it can also increase one's chance of success by preventing them from buying or selling into wicking price action that is not truly indicative of the trend.

**Candle Stick Formations**

A lot of materials have been written on various candlestick formations and in my experience the new trader will put far too much weight in these formations, Treating these formations as if they are some secret sauce to conquering the markets. In my experience candle stick formations and patterns are quite important, but what is less important is memorizing every catchy name for the formations and being able to recite them off the top of your head. Once one understands the principles and market forces these formations are conveying they will be much better served in comparison to just memorizing their names.

The most important concepts of analyzing candlestick formations relate to the size of the bodies and wicks on the candles being analyzed. In addition, volume should also be a main consideration when looking at candlesticks in order to gauge the level of market participation over the relevant period (a little write up on volume will be coming shortly).

**Core Concepts on formations:**

**Wicks:**

* A long wick coming out the bottom of a candle on a downtrend may reflect that a local floor has been reached for the asset. The long wick reflects this because it shows that the market has readily bought up the price of the asset at lower prices.
   * For example, here is what is known as a "bullish hammer", or dragonfly doji, on the 3d tf for the S&P 500 in the march lows of 2020: [https://imgur.com/gallery/xjjC3dB](https://imgur.com/gallery/xjjC3dB)
      * you will notice that there was a massive wick coming out the bottom of the candle body (reflecting the strong buy pressure at those lower levels) and then subsequently no candle body closed below the body of this bullish hammer/dragonfly doji.
* Similarly, a long wick coming out the top of a candle on an uptrend may reflect that a local top has been reached for the asset. The long wick reflect this because it shows that the market has readily sold down the price of the asset at higher prices.
   * For example, here is a local top reached in September 2020 for the S&P 500 (the second arrow pointing out a long wick to the bottom and resumption of trend): [https://imgur.com/gallery/HFM85ni](https://imgur.com/gallery/HFM85ni)

**Body:**

* The size of the candle body and its relation to prior candle bodies is also of critical importance. As previously discussed, the candle body represents the open and closing prices of that asset for the given TF. This range can be considered the "accepted price range" for the asset while the wicks are outliers on the relevant price action.
* Therefore, a candle body that closes above the prior candle body can be indicative of bullish trend resuming.
   * For example, here is a shot of 3d S&P 500 showing the relevance of candle bodies: [https://imgur.com/gallery/NP3AT6d](https://imgur.com/gallery/NP3AT6d)
* Here is another example except for a bearish continuation of candle bodies: [https://imgur.com/gallery/JeZPCUB](https://imgur.com/gallery/JeZPCUB)

**Doji:**

* A doji is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns.
* Doji candlesticks look like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign.
   * Here are some types of dojis: [https://imgur.com/gallery/GNWdwyG](https://imgur.com/gallery/GNWdwyG)
* Dojis by themselves are not inherently bearish or bullish patterns, they must be analyzed in context of the greater trend and accompanying volume.
* However, Dojis are a sign of indecision in the market place. The fact that there was very little range between the open and close (thereby causing the candle to have a very small body) reflects that bulls and bears are undecided on which direction the asset should continue.
* In practice, I often view Dojis as a sign to watch out, because it suggests the asset may soon be making a sizable move one way or the other.
* For example, here is a recent 3d gravestone doji on AAPL incorporating several of the concepts related to candles touched on in this article: [https://imgur.com/gallery/NYYwn1x](https://imgur.com/gallery/NYYwn1x)

Now that some general concepts have been outlined regarding the relevancy of candle bodies and candle wicks, take a look at the below traditional candlestick formations and try to determine why they are considered "bullish" or "bearish" candlestick formations:

* Bullish candlestick formations: [https://imgur.com/gallery/LgIUUtg](https://imgur.com/gallery/LgIUUtg)

My previous broker Bolero didn't support penny stocks or PM/AH trading so that's why I changed in the first place._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla or Apple? I’m kind of new to this, only been trading for about 2 months. I would like to get some TSLA but since I only have about $1,300 total in my portfolio, I would have to sell my AAPL in order to afford it. Is this a good idea?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does the stock market work? I have a question that for examples if I have a 1000 dollars and I buy 10 stocks of a company at 100 dollars each and the stocks go up 3 dollars so will my only profit be 30 dollars because I've seen people that make alot of profit with 1000 dollars in 1 trade or do they use something like leverage. I don't know what leverage is so please also do tell me about that with examples and yeah please tell is this how it works? And what is the minimum amount of money to start with and how much can that be turned into?
Thanks!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ US Market Hydrogen Rally Hey guys before I start I just sold now all my earnings besides that I'm still interested in what will happen when the US market opens in 20min to see either a big sell off or huge increase again.
What's your opinion?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Xiaomi stock I really like Xiaomi as a company and I think they have great products for a very competitive price. They are not listed in the US so does it mean that the Alibaba and Tencent problems won't affect them? I am in Europe so I have no problem buying it. I just wonder if you can't delist Xiaomi as it's not listed, then is it a relatively safe bet? Just please, no answers about how Communist China is evil and that it's an ADR in Cayman islands. These risks I am aware of. I am interested in exactly this aspect i.e no listing in NYSE, no troubles from the US government delistings?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Today's Pre-Market Movers & News [Thursday, January 7th, 2021] #Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub!

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there “will be an orderly transition” of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, January 7th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So...Am I crazy or did this guy prove the stock market was gradually changed into a Ponzi scheme without anyone noticing? Can anyone debunk this? This is currently blowing my mind, so please, help me out here. There's this guy Tan Liu who has been pushing this idea that the majority of the stock market fits the legal definition of a Ponzi scheme. Yes, it would easily be the biggest financial crime in American history. Yes, its inflammatory and sounds like sensationalism. I know.

He's had little to no traction, for a couple years now. Wrote a book about it called The Ponzi Factor and has some compelling YouTube explainers. I've searched debunkings…expecting to hit a brick wall as usual with something as sensational as this, and to my surprise, I cannot for the life of me find anything convincing. I’m not a conspiracy guy (I can’t stand them actually) and I generally defer to convention. However, I can’t get this out of my brain. The bare logic of it seems inescapable to me and the implications are so large, I’ve just been fixated on it.

So I wrote this up because I'm curious to see what reddit thinks. It's only been discussed very briefly here and dismissed out-right without really thinking about what he's saying.

His basic argument is fundamental: Stocks are not ownership instruments if owners never receive money from the companies they own. This makes the majority of US stocks worthless, because only thing that gave them worth has been sneakily stripped away without affecting people's perception of their value. Perception meeting reality of course, would revalue much of the market to 0.

I'll try to break down the argument as concisely as possible… or at least as best as I’ve come to understand it.

**What gives a stock value, and why do we buy these things in the first place?**

When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of the company… right? This is what I've always understood, and pretty much what everyone says. Stocks are an "ownership instrument". You own "stock" in a company. So, if they turn out to be successful - you make money too. Super basic. This is the fundamental assumption that makes stocks things people want to own.

And what makes owning a stock, owning part of a company? You can't just give someone a price of paper and call them an owner. There has to be some real, tangible benefit.

**So there are two things make stocks ownership instruments:**

1. They pay dividends. The company shares its profit with you via direct payments – the more the profit – the more the dividend. This is the one that matters. Money. Company makes money – you make money. Because you’re an owner. That’s why we’re here.
2. You get voting rights on major company decisions. (but if you're not getting paid - who cares? Are you buying stocks for voting rights in a company that doesn't pay you?)

The crazy part - the majority of today's stocks don't pay a dividend. They used to, but this has been slowly eroded since the turn of the century and heavily accelerated in the 1960s, championed by Warren Buffett. So, following this logic, if you took away dividends.... it would it mean a stock is NOT an ownership instrument...which would mean... *they're not a stock.* (this is where your bullshit detectors go off, I know, but just follow the logic)

The only reason you can sell the stock at a higher price later to another investor (capital gains), is because people value the stock. But *why* do they value the stock? They value the stocks because they are ownership instruments. They are ownership instruments because they pay a dividend. People still trade these non-dividend "Ponzi assets", as he calls them, on the marketplace and think they have value because...well... ???

So if you really digest this reality (or this is how it went for me), you think, how could this be true? Are people trading worthless pieces of paper like crazy people? Is my financial advisor ignorant or a shill? Is the smoke and mirrors so intense that everyone just follows along blindly? This can’t be, right? The implications are too crazy. What percentage of investors actually know about any of this?

He uses Google as an example. Google gives its class C shareholders no voting rights and pays no dividends Google states the "par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each stock is $.001 US Dollars. So, what is Google selling when they sell you a stock? Why would people buy and sell these things? Why would human being put a monetary value of Google stock? Zoom out and think big picture. What do you actually own here?? This is the thing I can’t get out of my head.

But wait, this is crazy, you think, of course Google stocks have value. They’re freaking Google stocks. Say you bought one stock of Google early at $1, and now it's worth $1000, and you sold. Great investment. Well... where did the $999 come from when you sold the stock?

The answer is... some guy who bought it. Another investor just like you. Only because he believes that it is ownership instrument, and the thing he bought from you has value. And that investor is hoping that he'll sell it for even more, but the money he'll make....is just from another investor. This is buy low, hell high, or capital gains. This financial architecture, Tan argues, fits the SEC definition of a Ponzi Scheme.

So... if this guy is right - if you own Google stock… you own... a worthless, arbitrary thing that people believe have value. Their belief, of course, being the *only* thing that gives them value. A digital token that says Google on it - that has absolutely no financial link with the company. There is no logical reason it should track the success of the company. This is also a possible explanation for why the S&P is back to 2019 highs. Analyzing Googles fundamentals is simply absolute insanity. The chain of money completely excludes Google's profits, mathematically and financially.

Just keep an open mind for a sec. If this logic checks out -- the only money to be made from Google stock never, ever, comes from Google's profits, but exclusively from the pockets of other people who have nothing to do with Google. therefore, Google's ability to make money doesn't matter - at all. The stocks' value are a complete illusion that we have assumed has to track with the company’s ability to turn a profit. That mechanic is only relevant… if you see some of those profits via dividends.

If people knew the truth, the value of their stock would crash to 0. There is no benefit to owning Google stock other than other people paying you for them. If you couldn’t make capital gains, think about it, what benefit would there be in owning Google stock?

Dividend stocks, however, are legitimate (unless of course they stop paying it- which they can - instantly tanking the real value to zero), and the author explains that dividends are supposed to be fundamental to stocks. Dividend stocks are a true ownership instrument, and in that case - capital gains make sense, because people are offering you money for something with real value - ownership. This is the true, sound mechanic of the stock market.

So further down this quarantine boredom fueled rabbit hole.. this is on his website and Instagram… a logic proof of why non-dividend stocks fit the SEC definition of a Ponzi scheme.

**S.E.C. Definition:** A Ponzi Scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.

**TPF Proof:** In practice, under foreseeable and non-hypothetical conditions, we can observe the following characteristics for non-dividend stocks.

1. Stocks are investment instruments.
2. Investors do not receive any money from the companies they own. The returns to existing investors—the realized capital gains—are strictly dependent on the funds contributed by new investors.
3. Investors think the returns come from the underlying business \[purported\].

The characteristics of non-dividend stocks meet all three technical elements in the definition. The word fraud is a subjective opinion word, not technical. Therefore, non-dividend stocks meet the SEC’s definition of a Ponzi scheme.

Ponzi schemes are illegal for many reasons, being they steal from the gullible/confused masses to benefit the few. Remember, Ponzi schemes produce winners towards the top of the pyramid. If you made capital gains, sure, you made money, but you took it from someone else, just like you. It is a net loss for investors.

And think about the crime here if true, the Ponzi scam simply vacuums up money from investors and concentrates them into corporate pockets and early investors (top of the pyramid). Taking away the dividend of course is denying another payment to investors. So, in essence, if true, this has just been just sneakily orchestrated systematic theft. And if/when the house of cards collapses, the top of the pyramid takes the money and runs. Is this real, reddit? Please let’s keep it logical please and not attack eachother. And please avoid jargon soup if you can!

Also to save some time, because yes I did Google this before posting, here are some common counter arguments I’ve found and Tan’s responses (that seem solid to me).

* Dividends “could” be paid in the future: Hypotheticals aren’t reality. What matters is the reality right now.
* The value of money is just a belief as well. No, because money is legal tender, backed by law. Companies print stocks to get money, and investors buy stocks because they want money. This puts fiat money and stocks on completely different hierarchies.
* He’s just selling a book: The book is non-profit, and he gives away a digital copy (Reddit doesn't allow bitly links!)
* Stock buybacks – companies dilute shares when they buyback, counteracting the benefit.
* Voting gives them value because you can vote for them to pay dividends. It’s a democracy! – companies can issue more shares and tip the scales whenever they want._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | RUN, ENPH, TLRY, ACB, NIO, ROKU, CAT, F & Other Stock News [01-07] **Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot & Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small & mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which  shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

&#x200B;

The Very Good Food Company is a food technology company that designs, develops, produces, distributes and sells plant-based alternatives. 

&#x200B;

Currently their products are in over 275+ stores. They have had to put 50+ retail stores on a waitlist because they cannot produce enough of their product. But... not for long. They currently have 3 facilities. 1 in Victoria, British Columbia, 2 in Vancouver, British Columbia referred to as the Rupert facility, and 3 in California referred to as the Patterson facility. Of these 3 facilities, the Victoria one is the only one that was producing product. Facilities 2 and 3 will come online in 1Q 2021. 

&#x200B;

Facility 1 in Victoria has production capacities of roughly 20,000 pounds/week for a total production of 1,375,000 pounds/year. 

Facility 2 in Vancouver (Rupert facility) has production capacities of roughly 700,000 pounds/week for a total production of 37,000,000 pounds/year. In their November, 2020 press release they said this is to be phased in over the next year, so by November, 2021 there should be a significant increase in production. 

Facility 3 in California (Patterson facility) has production capacities of roughly 1,800,000 pounds/week for a total production of 98,500,000 pounds/year. For the California facility, they have an initial lease on a first 25,000 square foot portion capable of doing 550,000 pounds/week, or a total production of 28,000,000 pounds/year. Their lease has further agreements to expand into those other spaces. It is unclear when this facility will be fully phased in, but we can be sure that the first initial space would be in the next 24 months. This facility is on the same property as its logistics provider and close to key shipping routes, meaning easier distribution. 

&#x200B;

Lets run an analysis:

***Scenario 1:*** So, let us look at total production after 2021. The **1,375,000 pounds** from the Victoria facility should stay **consistent**. Say they only ramp up a **quarter** of what they anticipate for the Vancouver (Rupert) facility, thats an additional **9,250,000 pounds** that they should be able to produce a year from now. Say they only ramp up a **quarter** of the production for the initial space at the California (Patterson) facility, thats an additional **\~7,000,000 pounds** that they should be able to produce a year from now. This means an approximate **17,625,000 pounds** of product should be doable a year from now. In their November, 2020 press release they stated that they sell their product for **$7 to 10$ a pound**. Take the lower end and that is **$123,375,000** (high end is $176,250,000). So in FY 2022 they should be making well over $100 million dollars, and this is being fairly generous. 

***Scenario 2:*** With a more aggressive outlook, the Rupert facility was to be phased in over a year - so a year from now the facility should be able to produce the **37,000,000 pounds/year**. In a year I would expect about half the production of that initial space at the California facility (as they have publicly stated the Rupert facility is the focus near term), so that is an additional **14,000,000 pounds** a year from now. This means an approximate **52,375,000 pounds** of product should be doable in FY 2022. Taking the lower end and that is **$366,625,000** (high end is $523,750,000). 

***Analysis:*** Now looking at both scenarios I have given a very large range for FY 2022, anywhere from $123M to $523M. Beyond Meat (a competitor) currently has a market cap of 7.5B, with expected 2020 revenues of 412M (meaning a P/S of \~18). Using this same P/S for VRYYF in the future (on the low end), they would be looking at a market cap of 2.2B in 2022 (340% increase from current share price), and on the high end a market cap of 9.4B (\~1800% increase from current share price). Now obviously, similar industry but changing markets and many other factors to consider. This is simply looking at projections, with many assumptions about the stock itself and the industry they are in. Other considerations include: scaling a business internationally is hard (this why they brought in directors from proven businesses in the food industry), dilution of shares as more stock offerings happen as aggressive expansion commences and capital is needed, and various competitors who have more capital and a more well known brand. Right now VRYYF has VERY low debt, though this would be valuable to mention. This was just a quick analysis, please address and discuss this with me, very intrigued to hear what everyone thinks. 

&#x200B;

For reference, Beyond Meat produced around 51,000,000 pounds of product in 2019 (for a revenue of \~$300,000,000). This means VRYYF is about 2 years behind Beyond Meat. If it can execute, they should be a really good growth story. 

&#x200B;

Now, it is fine to talk about how **MUCH** you can produce, but can you **SELL** it? Currently VRYYF is in **275+ retail stores**, and due to insufficient production capabilities has had to put **50+ retailers on a waitlist**. [**Spud.ca**](https://Spud.ca) currently sells Very Good Butcher products through its website. Signed a distribution agreement with **UNFI Canada** \- a subsidiary of **United Natural Foods**, the largest publicly traded wholesale distributor in NA. UNFI has **40,000 retail partners** and **10,000 suppliers**. Products available at the **Farm Boy** retail stores - part of Sobeys 1500 store network. Products also available at **Thrifty Foods** \- also part of Sobeys 1500 store network.  With the Rupert facility coming online in 1Q 2021, VRYYF is seeking new distribution opportunities across Canada and into the United States.

&#x200B;

VRYYF has industry-leading gross margins of 42%, 13% higher than Beyond Meat. VRYYF is not profitable, and I would expect another share offering to raise capital for this massive expansion. Going from 1,375,000 pounds of product per year, to 136,875,000 pounds of product per year. This is a 9800% increase in production. If VRYYF hits on all expectations, I could see exponential growth. But, valuations are insane at this moment - but which stocks aren't? Time will tell! 

&#x200B;

They have 93 locations nationwide and their stock has been pretty range-bound for several years, due to minimal net sales growth and flattish EPS for the past 3 years.

EPS

2017 - $0.40

2018 - $0.45

2019 - $0.31

I bring this stock up because as some of you may know, they partnered with Netflix on the home organization show Home Edit which became a hit on Netflix and in turn, helped bring a lot of awareness to The Container Store:

[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=the%20home%20edit,Container%20Store](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=the%20home%20edit,Container%20Store)

In the Home Edit TV series, the two professional organizers: Joanna Teplin and Clea Shearer help organize the closets of their clients, including several celebrities including Reese Witherspoon and Khloe Kardashian which resulted in much fanfare. The Home Edit’s followers jumped from 1.9 to 3.9 M in just a few weeks and the Container Store saw nearly 300k incremental followers on Instagram.

Apparently, the Netflix series provided a major boost to The Container Store’s sales in September when the series was released, per the CEO’s notes in their Q2 earnings call:

>*During Q2, all 93 stores were opened and operating at close to normalized schedules with limited in-store customer capacity. Q2 to-date through August -- through fiscal August, TCS net sales were slightly down to last year.* ***In fiscal September, TCS net sales were up 17.8% to last year***\*, bringing the entire quarter up 5.3%. The 17.8% increase in September sales does not include the $6.5 million of online orders taken in fiscal September that are expected to ship, deliver and be recognized in our Q3 financial results.\*

**Source:** [**https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/**](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/)

The big boost in net sales on top of their reduced SG&A expenses that was being carried over from Q1 due to pandemic-related expense reduction helped drive a very strong Q2 in all areas:

1. Net Income
2. Free Cash Flow
3. EPS
4. Long-Term Debt Reduction
5. Improving Gross Margin
6. Gross Profit

The reason I’m very interested in this stock is that I think it’s totally undervalued due to the Home Edit tailwinds that continue to persist.

Specifically, in their Q2 earnings call, the CFO stated in terms of guidance:

>*Given the unusual sales trends in our business, we believe that is appropriate to provide more color about our go-forward Q3 expectations. There are few points I would like to make. As we said, fiscal Q3 is off to a strong start, as a halo effect with The Home Edit's Netflix show launch has continued into October. With that said, we are not assuming the quarter-to-date elevated level of sales persist. The expected moderation of sales throughout Q3 is partly due to our conservative approach and estimating holiday department sales in the light of the notable declines over the past few years in our holiday sales.* ***Therefore, we currently expect year-over-year sales growth in Q3 to modestly exceed the 5% growth we just reported for Q2.***

However, the company made a huge press release on December 22, 2020, that their CEO Melissa Reiff was retiring and in addition to that release, they increased their guidance:

**Fiscal Third Quarter Update**

>*Results for the fiscal third quarter 2020 are tracking well ahead of the expectations the Company shared on their October 21, 2020 fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings call.* ***As a result, the Company currently expects fiscal third quarter 2020 sales to increase in the high teens range compared to the prior year period, with adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the $0.35 to $0.40 range versus $0.05 in the prior year period.***

For a company that has historically had softer than expected holiday sales to see such strength in Q3 is pretty great news. On top of that, their adjusted EPS guidance was $0.35 to $0.40, which is likely within $0.05 of diluted GAAP EPS.

Moving on, these tailwinds from the Home Edit have also been transformational to the business fundamentals of this company. This company has for many years now been saddled with high debt that has been an EPS drag. In the most recent quarter, they paid down $60+ M in LT debt from their huge cash flow in Q2 and per the CFO will continue to use excess cash flow to pay down debt.

Since they are expecting another strong quarter and per their guidance on SG&A being only slightly up from Q2:

>*As we look to Q3, with the sales recovery and restoration of expenses, we would expect our SG&A expenses to be largely on top line with the same period last year.*

Assuming SG&A is 113.000 (which is likely slightly higher than guided), they should have another high cash flow quarter which should mean additional payments to bring down LT debt which should then reduce interest expenses which are on average is 2-3% of total net income but should be trending downwards as more LT debt is paid off.

**My Take**

The Container Store’s current TTM EPS is: $0.38 and as posted above, if they can do a conservative $0.35 GAAP EPS in Q3, their TTM EPS jumps to $0.68 which is the highest TTM EPS they’ve had in several years.

The Container Store is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 29.29 and assuming they can do a reasonable Q4 where the Home Edit tailwinds continue to persist for another few months at least (it hasn’t shown any real signs of slowing down: [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=the%20container%20store&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=the%20container%20store&geo=US)), it would be safe to assume, imo, a $0.45 EPS in Q4 which is traditionally their strongest quarter, which combined with the Q3 EPS guidance of $0.35 would result in a TTM EPS of $0.87 and if the P/E ratio drops to 20, this would translate to $17.40/share sometime after the May Q4 earnings report (57% increase from today's closing price of $11.07). Hard to say if the market will reward a 20 P/E, but that's what I'm assuming.

I think people are looking for something to do during COVID.  Strong word of mouth referrals for the Home Edit show and people’s general desire to organize may have potentially changed the business trajectory of The Container Store permanently. If anything, it enabled them to reduce their severe debt load likely by half which should enable them to be more aggressive with store openings that should only help improve top-line growth in the future.

Positions $25c 02/19_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy Cannabis Now! As soon as it is decriminalized federally (which it will be due to the massive upset in Georgia), interstate commerce can commence as well as international trade with our neighbors to the north and south, who have also legalized (Mexico recently). It will sky rocket and all the “conservatives” will wonder how all the potheads got so rich suddenly.

Biden and Harris have admitted to their error in voting against cannabis in the past. I also believe that Biden will tout legalizing cannabis as one of his major achievements for his first 100 days. Which means they will pressure all those around them to vote to pass.

Plus, why not legalize and tax it federally? We are kinda in the middle of a pandemic and the economy needs all the help it can get.

The only ones who don’t want it legalized are crusty old farts. Support is huge for the green.

With the UK out of the EU the government are going to want to inject money into developing industry on home soil especially green energy and considering that the UK is more likely to come across tariff with EU trade. Also if the U.K. are showing European hydrogen dominance it puts them in the upper hand for European trade deals.

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ESPR - Esperion Therapeutics. Severely Undervalued? I received an interesting stock recommendation today from a friend with considerable professional experience in financial services. He recommended Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR). It's a pharmaceutical company whose major product is being approved and rolled out worldwide - a drug that is used to control cholesterol, which is a major health concern for many. Their new drug, Nexletol, is better than Lipitor because many people are allergic to statins, of which Lipitor is. They just gained FDA and EU commission approval and have a major potential revenue incoming, which will only increase as COVID subsides.

ESPR was driven down hard by COVID, and just now trading above its 52 week low. But here's the interesting part - He says institutions hold 122% of the shares and there is 42% short interest (as of Dec. 15th), a large majority of the institutional shares are likely in index funds that are not traded. If there is a squeeze, he says there is maybe 30% of the float in discretionary hands for the 42% shorts to buy back - so they might find it difficult to find shares to cover - they could get burned pretty badly in a squeeze. Institutions have likely accumulated even more since 12/15 and there are even less shares to cover a short. A considerable amount of that short is probably in option desks, and if you check out the options charts and you will see a grossly disproportionate amount of calls.

Current trading price (as of last close) is $28.92 (a little over 1/3 the 52 week high) and the the analysts mentioned in my various trading/research accounts have price targets from $35 to $150, with an average of $74. Different ranking services have this as a Buy or Strong Buy. Looking at the charts, the Daily Price Rate of Change is accelerating (price is going up ... and going up faster).  A big piece of news could double this in a week given its modest market cap.

Turbotax, on the other hand, is getting absolutely reamed while they keep stalling, blaming the IRS, and not showing much compassion towards their customers. Their twitter page is literally flooded with people stating they will no longer be using their service, and threats of class action lawsuits.

They own Federal ammunition, recently purchased Remington ammunition, and own a number of other sporting and clothing accessory chains like Bushnell, Camelback, etc.

They are basically broken into two segments, shooting sports and outdoor products. Shooting sports sales were up 26 percent to $380 million last quarter and outdoor products increased 35 percent to $195 million. Shooting sports contains the anmunition which has flown off the shelf since COVID and the CEO says they have over 1 billion in backlog orders. Equally exciting is the performance in outdoor products probably driven by COVID and people looking for outdoor activities.

They sold their gun business (Savage) in 2019 and paid down some debt so their balance sheet is improved. More importantly i think it reduces the risk of being regulated by the Biden administration as they will likely be focused on guns not ammunition. 

With the recent election results I suspect ammo sales to be strong for multiple years to come. With a market cap of only 1.67 billion it seems like a good value play to me and I expect a good 2-4 years of blow out sales. I own shares and may increase my position more in the coming weeks.
