 How should I Roth IRA and HSA I have been investing into my 401k.

100% in a large cap index tracking the s&p 500.

I'm contributing 8% to get the company match which is an additional 4%.

So right now I'm contributing 12% of my 70k per year salary. 

I have an individual account that I play around with as I'm learning the stock market. 

I've rebalanced my budget and now can put more money at work. 

I want to max my Roth IRA and HSA. 

I've read that the tax benefits of the HSA would be superior due the tax advantages. 

So I will be maxing the HSA first then trying to max my Roth IRA with my remaining savings. 

I'm stuck and a little confused on what I should be investing my HSA and Roth IRA into as I'm already investing into the s&p 500. 

Are there any guides you can recommend me? Books? 

I've read The intelligent investor so far. 

I think I need something that will give me a better understanding on how to build a portfolio when I'm adding different investing products right now? 

I know the basics but there is so much to learn. 

Am I doing this right?

Last week, I invested about 6k into various meme stocks. I started becoming nervous a few days later so I liquidated a lot of stocks. However, I bought back a lot of GME yesterday after a dip and finally gave up today seeing that the bubble had already burst and it wasn't a dip.

Can I live without $1500. Yes (In fact I even forgot to cash in a $1500 check for over a year). I'm only 23 and in grad school, so I like to look at each dollar very carefully. I'm also anguished at all the things $1500 could've bought me (a 75'' flat screen TV, a plane ticket to anywhere in the world, etc. But 1500 is only about 3% of my assets so I'm trying to sweat this off and move on as quick as possible. But I learned not to jump on stocks based on emotion. At one point, I was even up $1000 but I got too greedy and look where I'm now.

>His Pershing Square Capital Management LP recently increased its stake in Howard Hughes Corp. to nearly 25%. The Houston-based developer is ramping up construction of multifamily housing in Texas, Maryland, Hawaii and Las Vegas.

>“It’s not a Wall Street bet. It’s a generational bet,” said Mr. Ackman, who is also chairman of Howard Hughes’s board. The fund manager is widely known for his shareholder-activism campaigns and his bets on large companies such as Starbucks Corp. and J.C. Penney Co.

>Pershing Square increased its stake in Howard Hughes by about 4.7% between June and January, according to public filings. The firm bought common stock, and some of its counterparties exercised options that compelled Pershing Square to buy additional shares, filings show.

>Howard Hughes, a land owner and developer of master-planned communities, said it is starting construction on 1,475 new apartments across four cities that have experienced an influx of people over the past year.

>While many Americans were already leaving colder, more dense cities for more temperate and affordable places to live, the pandemic and the shift toward work from home accelerated those trends last year.

>Howard Hughes Chief Executive David O’Reilly said his company has seen more transplants from California seeking housing in its Summerlin master-planned community in Las Vegas, next to the Red Rock National Conservation Area. Apart from a 295-unit luxury-apartment complex, the developer is also starting construction on a 10-story office tower, anticipating demand from companies looking to relocate to where people want to live.

>Howard Hughes, which owns up to tens of thousands of acres in each project, sells smaller plots of land to other developers. It plans to continue building neighborhoods that mature and eventually become town centers.

>Building trails in these master-planned communities have also paid off, as many people prefer to live in walkable and bikeable neighborhoods. “The trail systems are cited as the number one or two amenity,” said Mr. O’Reilly, referring to resident surveys.

>Still, these large development projects are complex and require access to financing to keep going. A slowdown in the economy could hurt leasing activity once these properties are completed.

>Buildout could also suffer from higher construction costs or get mired in delays. In New York City, for instance, Howard Hughes continues to face difficulties in getting approvals to move ahead on its plans to build two towers in the Seaport District in lower Manhattan.

>“It proved to be a tough project. From an investor standpoint, people have already mentally written it off,” said Alexander Goldfarb, senior research analyst at Piper Sandler & Co.

>The share price of Howard Hughes has recovered from its March lows last year, but isn’t back to its prepandemic levels. At the start of 2020, its share price hovered around $123 and then plunged to $34 in March. It was at $88.23 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday.

>Howard Hughes Corp. began as an oil-drilling tool business started by the businessman and inventor Howard Hughes Sr. His famously eccentric son, the businessman, filmmaker and pilot Howard Hughes Jr., diversified the company into real estate.


>Mr. Ackman’s Pershing Square has held a position in the stock ever since it was spun off from mall owner General Growth Properties Inc., following its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2010.

>“We’ve owned it for 10 years, and it’s likely we’d still own this 10 years from now,” Mr. Ackman said.

I don't know if this is allowed - apologies if not, genuinely looking to spread some knowledge to help (hopefully) a lot of investors looking for a high growth area. In no way am I pumping: I already have a very healthy ownership and not planning on selling any time soon. Just posting for info and to point people to some places with good useful info for personal research

Given the games in the USA and very much suspected AIM manipulations, the wider the shareholder base the better !

So anyone looking for a mid-long term solid growth area (as the commodity cycle is rising), then take a look ...

\-----

One of the lesser known but really important (to the world) stocks is the somewhat unfashionable Bushveld Minerals.

Largely seen as a single commodity miner in an South Africa the huge potential, profits and growth prospects are just not understood.

The origins of this company lie in Iron Ore and there is a mountain of it (and a whole bunch of other stuff), but that is all left to the side now. The focus is on mining and processing Vanadium. Bushveld is one of the only primary production sites for Vanadium in the world. There is supplies from a limited life mine in Brazil and then in the 'free' world, it is Bushveld. The other places are in Russia and China

Vanadium is a critical mineral to the world with its primary use being in hardening steel, a whole bunch of materials and aerospace applications with a large and growing deficit of production vs need, and now ... Electrical Storage in the form of Vanadium Redox Reflow Batteries (VFRB). Power density is lower than Lithium, but so what... it does not catch fire !

Just to be clear - every single gram processed could be sold into Steel production every year forever ... generating growing profits and future dividends..... all the 'other' goodies to do with VFRB Storage just add value and a large and increasing profit

In 2018 Vanadium pricing peaked and with production rather less than 3,000 tonnes generated an EBITDA of £94M. With reducing Vanadium spot price but increased production the 2019 EBITDA was the same - point is that as production is rapidly rising to knocking 5,000 tonnes this year and 6,400 pretty much over the next 15 months, the sustained profitability is assured

To put it into a wider perspective, Bushveld is in the top 10 on AIM for NET Profit and in the top 33% of FTSE All Share for NET Profit, around the middle of F350 as well... not bad for an unloved company

Cash is king and as the rapid capital growth phase tops out dividends will flow and lots of them.

So to summarize ..

Two of the 4 primary Vanadium producing Plants are in South Africa and owned by Bushveld Minerals. All serious industry commentary points to a Vanadium deficit with inventories run low. With the world embarking on an infrastructure spending spree post Covid large amounts of re-enforced steel is required. This coincides with the long awaited development and commissioning of large scale VFRB facilities.

One of the great hindrances to VFRB has been the high price volatility of vanadium meaning the electrolyte costs (around 30-40% of the whole system) could not be capitalised easily. Now there is Leasing where the capital cost is transferred to Opex of 3, 5 or more years. VFRB plants can now be fully capitalised in a normal way as a physical build, structure and asset value.

Vertical integration, simply put really means the following:

\- Ore for processing - Bushveld has vast reserves and the new mining rights at Mokopane

\- Vanadium for steel - Bushveld Minerals

\- Electrolyte - Bushveld Energy

\- Leased electrolyte - VERL (the new rental consortium with Bushveld at the core)

\- VFRB systems - Invinity & Enerox - Bushveld has a stake and first rights to supply vanadium/electrolyte

At every stage of the value chain from ore to VFRB system, Bushveld has a big chunk of the action. Vertical Integration is having fingers in all the pies so no matter where you turn, it gets a slice.

As the commodity and cycle turns upwards and infrastructure building accelerates, Bushveld gains. The Orion funding arrangement takes production to at least 150% of current levels over the next 2-3 years with no debt as Vanadium pricing and usage accelerate worldwide.

A company with little debt, huge reserves, solid and growing free cash flow, visionary leadership and a very dedicated and growing workforce.

All businesses carry some level of risk, but unless the world dives into depression and stops building, there are few companies anyone could invest in with little or no downside, greater investment upside, and future high and sustained dividend potential.

[https://www.bushveldminerals.com/](https://www.bushveldminerals.com/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bumble S-1 & Special Distribution I am interested in the Bumble IPO and in reading the S-1 noticed there was a financing arrangement issued in October in order to distribute \~$325m to pre-IPO owners.

My question for those with more experience in IPOs; is this an unusual transaction or is it expected that the public company hold debts to remunerate former owners even if it weakens the Balance Sheet of the newly public company? Also why not pay with shares?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HRL stock (Hormel Foods), sounds good  [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402550-hormel-foods-why-largest-position-and-i-just-bought](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402550-hormel-foods-why-largest-position-and-i-just-bought)

Hormel is unique in that it offers such strong returns -- it crushes the market over any longer-term timeframe. And it manages to do so while having minimal downside risk. The company has no net debt, so its stock is immune to all short-term financial crises or liquidity shocks. Hormel is also able to (and often does) make acquisitions on good terms since it always has cash on hand and can close deals quickly without needing to raise funds.

The company's products are not at risk of technological disruption nor significant changes in consumer demand. That may seem true of all consumer staples companies, but it's actually not. Many firms have stuck to old brands that are no longer in fashion or on top of nutritional trends. Many dated product categories like cereal, soda, and crackers are in seemingly slow but irreversible long-term decline.

Hormel's management team's central mission is to avoid that fate. The company prides itself on generating 15% of its revenues from new products launched over the past five years. It invests heavily (by food company standards) in R&D and is always rolling out line extensions and new formats for existing products (it's taken huge share in the emerging meat and dairy snacks category, for example, by figuring out that convenience store shoppers wanted an alternative to usual junk foods long before the rest of the market woke up to the nascent protein revolution).

The company also focuses on being agnostic -- it wants to sell you whatever protein you want. If you want almond butter and plant protein-based "meat", it's happy to sell that. If you want organic high-end deli meats, it is now a leader in that. It just bought a major barbeque business. And they were first to jump into turkey on a national level almost two decades ago, helping to bolster turkey's popularity as a leaner alternative to traditional offerings. Hormel anticipates what consumers will want five years from now and prepares accordingly.

Yes, Hormel is known for SPAM. Many people instinctively wince when they think about that product. But, you're probably not the target audience for it. There's a huge regional community within Asians and Latinos that like canned meat and SPAM in particular. Just as Hormel has bought specialty nut butters, organic meats, and the nation's leading guacamole to appeal to certain consumers, it's happy to sell SPAM and other products to different demographics.

As the CEO says, we are the protein company. As shareholders, it doesn't matter which proteins are more popular any given day as long as we're gaining market share. Also, for what it's worth, SPAM sales have hit [new record highs](https://www.sunset.com/food-wine/kitchen-assistant/spam-breaks-sales-records-hawaiian-cuisine?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) each of the past five years, so that's not bad for a legacy product.

Hormel focuses on having all its brands as the #1 or #2 player in its category. And it tends to divest brands which it can't get to that point. When you go to a grocery store, if you want to buy something that Hormel sells, they're generally going to have the biggest shelf space of it. In some cases, it may be the only one of that type -- how many brands of ready-to-eat guacamole, corned beef hash or chocolate hazelnut butter do you need? Particularly with the way shopping is shifting, you'd rather own 50% market share in a bunch of small categories with fat profit margins rather than being one of eight different cereal or ketchup sellers._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Athabasca Oil Corporation (TSE: ATH) Athabasca Oil (TSE: ATH)

Guys,

I invested in Athabasca Oil, a Canadian energy company based on the development of thermal and light oil assets.

In Q4 of 2020, the Alberta government introduced geothermal regulations to diversify their energy sector. Part of ATH’s projects are thermal oil which has regulatory approval for 40,000 bbl/d. With Biden axing Keystone XL, geothermal is the direction that Canadian oil and gas companies are taking to diversify.

Currently, I’ve pulled in a 55% return over 3 months.

I bought in at 0.17 and it’s been going up ever since. My current analysis is that with the political climate in Canada surrounding Canada-US relations, the feds are going to push for geothermal production to ramp up in Canada, and if there’s a Canadian election in 2021, the stock is bound to shoot up.

Take a look in on it and I’m curious to hear your thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I am long Lumen Technologies (LUMN)? **$LUMN - $11.55 per share.**  


Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN): Based on the market cap, currently it's valued at around $12.5 billions and trading around $11.55 per share.   


**Brief History:**  
Lumen Technologies, Inc. was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana. The company was formerly known as CenturyLink, Inc. and changed its name to Lumen Technologies, Inc. in September 2020.  


LUMN acquired "Level 3" in November 2017. Then CEO of Level 3, Jeffrey Storey became the new CEO of LUMN in June 2018. While Jeffrey was CEO at Level 3, he completely turned around that company.   


**Major risk factors?**   
High debt level and declining revenue on legacy assets.  


**Why I am long LUMN?**

LUMN owns about 450,000 miles of optic fiber and serves 60 countries. 

Since, becoming CEO in 2018, Jeffrey has drastically improved the balance sheet. LUMN refinanced \~$18 billion to $20 billion in last few years which helped to reduce the interest expense significantly and push debt maturity way in the future. They also started paying down the debt.   


Revenue on legacy business is declining but the revenue on rest of the business seems stable and started growing slowly. 

With the current free cash flow - $1/year dividend seems sustainable.

\[PS: Please note this is not an investment advise. I am long LUMN.\]

But I've missed many opportunities to gain 30-100+% in a day with a quick trade because I never get the news fast enough to buy early. Today's SAVA is a good example: it closed yesterday at $22, opened at $33, and peaked on the day at over $70. I see now that Yahoo news posted by 9:00 AM EST (before market open) SAVA's preliminary results from an Alzheimer's trial. The news was so obviously good, that making money was guaranteed for anyone who heard in time.

Whenever I see the market movers for the day and week, most of them are small pharma companies that swing violently based on quick news reports. I dislike the medical system, and I don't invest in that sector. But I'd still love to milk some quick trade opportunities, if possible.

So, I'd love to know if any of you have suggestions for phone apps or websites that give quick actionable news, ideally without the clutter of politics and other.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I believe AMD sees an All Time High in the coming months AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.

Robinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.

There are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))

Along with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.

AMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.

The one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.

Hope this is all helpful!

* 20 year track record

**Reporting Business Segments:**

* Industrial Automation(IA)
* High Speed Rail (HSR) and Subway related Control systems

   * Recurring and high-margin (70%) stream
   * Typically related to post-warranty maintenance and training. 1 to 3 year warranty on 10-15 year design life
* **Steady growth in Install base**
   * The 26% topline growth YoY in Q3 in IA likely included significant catch-up demand from Q2 and USD weakness
   * Sustained constant-currency growth is perhaps closer to 10%
   * Reminds me of Boeing’s and Apple’s services revenue playbook, though of course nowhere near the same quality
* **Equipment replacement cycle** to embrace smart factory manufacturing techniques in China
   * In turn driving new contracts and increased service revenues, per 20-F
   * 10-15 year design life of control systems provides recurring opportunities
* **Favorable policies for Domestic suppliers**
   * Import substitution accelerating in High speed rail signalling
   * Incentives for factory modernization
* **Total solution provider** \- from equipment supply to installation to maintenance
   * Many Western firms require intermediaries to install/maintain. E.g. SAP installation by consultants
* **Entering new areas**
   * Executing a pilot project on smart highways, where highways have sensors all along them to guide traffic in extreme weather
   * Industrial Internet-of-Things is another buzz area

**Financials Appeal**

* **Take-private proposal for 17$ currently on the table**
   * Offer from a former insider
   * He upped his[ offer to 17$](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210129/A52Z922CL22232AL22232CY23PRJZ222Z632/) and revealed a 7% position after management rejected his prior offer at 15.5$
   * I expect management to reject this offer too
   * More than anything, this offer eliminates the need to discount for unknowns
* **Strong balance sheet**:
   * The stock is a net-net stock - it’s net current assets is greater than all liabilities
   * Setups like this are extremely rare in my experience for solid companies and provide a huge margin of safety
* **Compelling Valuation**
   * **Revenue**
      * Honeywell: 2019/TTM: 36/33 $B
      * HollySys IA: 2019/TTM: 259/255 $M
      * HollySys IA + Rail: 2019/TTM: 475/438 $M (flat in IA and down in Rail)
   * **Revenue growth pre-pandemic**
      * Honeywell: 5% in 2017/18. 18/19 numbers affected by divestment
      * HollySys IA: 20% 2019 over 2018.
      * HollySys IA: 7% TTM YOY ending Q3 2020 (3 Quarters of pandemic)
   * **Current Price/TTM FCF multiple**
      * Honeywell: 33
      * HollySys: 8
      * We don’t have per-segment FCF, but IA and HSR are similar margins with similar revenue numbers
      * FCF calculated net of Working Capital impacts
   * **Current Price/2019 FCF multiple**
      * Honeywell: 23
      * HollySys: 6  (fiscal 2019)
      * FCF calculated net of Working Capital impacts
   * **Market Cap**
      * Honeywell: 140 B$
      * HollySys: 840 M$
   * **Worth 56$ using Honeywell’s Price/FCF multiples**
      * Just the IA segment should be worth north of 30$
* **Potential buyback**: Management indicated stock buyback and/or acquisitions once they feel comfortable the pandemic is behind
* **Near-term catalysts**: Q1 earnings report in mid-Feb should provider more clarity on the underlying trend

**Key Risks**

* The numbers look better than they are because USD lost 10% against Yuan last year
   * With unprecedented USD printing, foreign exposure in the portfolio is reasonable
* Revenue growth in Industrial Automation stays below 10%
   * In mitigation, Honeywell had a peak 2017/18 revenue growth of 5% and has a 30 P/E. IA markets tend to be very sticky after all
* Something is wrong with the accounting (it’s a Chinese company)
   * Insider take-private bid at 17$ along with a 7% stealth stake suggests the assets are good quality rather than something nefarious going on.
   * 20 year track record argues against it too
* Management sells out for the 17$ offer currently on the table
   * I don’t see this as likely as they are aware of the equity’s underpricing

**Bottomline**: Solid 20 year track record with reasonable growth prospects as Chinese factories become "smart" with other irons in the fire. At Honeywell’s Price/FCF multiples, it is worth close to 50$. A former insider’s 7% stake and a persistent, second increased bid at 17$ to acquire the company speaks to recognition of its under-valuation. Trading volumes of 250K shares/day suggest an under-followed company rather than any fundamental reason to trade as a net-net stock.

Cheers.

**Edit #1**: Corrected insider's stake from 14% as originally mentioned to 7%. I misread the [disclosure](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210129/A52Z922CL22232AL22232CY23PRJZ222Z632/) as 6.9% of Ace Lead's stake controlled by Shao + 7.1% owned by Shao = 14%, but the 7.1% includes Ace Lead's stake. So, Shao's stake is 7.1%_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood: It's time for real-time settlement Amidst all the hate directed at Robinhood and other brokers for the trading halts on names targeted by the Great WSB Short Squeeze of 2021, a few of us looked deeper and found the real issue was the clearinghouses. These "non-governmental regulators" have immense discretionary power over the market. In Robinhood's case, their clearinghouse called "The DTCC" raised Robinhood's capital deposit requirements by 10x in middle of the rally to cover the volatility of their users trades. This forced Robinhood into a liquidity crisis and caused them to restrict trades in highly desired names.

Today, the Robinhood CEO put out a blog post calling for real-time settlement, which would eliminate the need for these capital deposits and open up the industry to new entrants. We have the technology!

[Text](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement)

>It’s time for T+2 to go.  
>  
>Last week we saw the impact the two-day trade settlement period has on investors and ultimately the entire American financial system. Clearinghouse deposit requirements skyrocketed overnight. People were unable to buy some of the securities they wanted. Investors were angry and concerned, an unintended byproduct of the antiquated settlement process.  
>  
>When people invest, they’re placing their hopes and dreams for the future in our financial system. We can’t let them down.  
>  
>The existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change. Every day, clearing brokers like Robinhood Securities have to meet deposit requirements imposed by clearinghouses to support customer trades between the trade date and the date the trades settle. Investors are left waiting for their trades to clear, and the clearing brokers have their proprietary cash locked up, until the settlement is final days after the trade.  The clearinghouse deposit requirements are designed to mitigate risk, but last week’s wild market activity showed that these requirements, coupled with an unnecessarily long settlement cycle, can have unintended consequences that introduce new risks.  
>  
>There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses.  
>  
>It’s been four years since the securities industry moved from a three-day to a two-day settlement period. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, as well as other stakeholders, have recognized the benefits of an even shorter timeframe, leveraging technology. Meanwhile, millions of new investors have entered the market for the first time as technology transforms the world.  
>  
>It’s time for the financial system to catch up.  
>  
>The last few weeks have been extraordinary. We’ve seen a social movement intersect with technology and financial markets, and retail investors take the lead. These are our neighbors and friends and many from our Robinhood community.  
>  
>As industry leaders, we need to meet this moment with a vision for the future and a focus on the people we serve. The industry, Congress, regulators, and other stakeholders need to come together to deploy our intellectual capital and engineering resources to move to real-time settlement of U.S. equities. Accomplishing this won’t be without its well-documented challenges, but it is the right thing to do and Robinhood is eager to drive this critical effort on behalf of all investors.   Technology is the answer, not the oft-cited impediment. We believe it is important for all relevant stakeholders to convene in the near term to discuss the urgency and necessity of this issue.

Yes its high but this could go way higher. I ran some numbers and concluded an opinion: Biogens alzheimers drug did nkt do well and it resulted in a 25 billion loss in market value for biib. Sava still only has a 2b value. If this drug works well like people wanted biogens drug to, it is not inconceivable it could be worth as much as  biogen's loss in market cap (25b, or 900 a share) depending on how the market values sava. Alzheimers is a bane for scientists and doctors and has been forever. . I encourage reading the results on sava ._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A few questions for experienced investors about market statistics such as YoY Growth and Total Market Value. I’m a new investor looking for some insight into your perspectives on markets as a whole. My experience is limited but I have a basic college level economics class under my belt so I went into this flurry with an understanding of what stocks are and how investment works, and I’ve done some deep dives into how short selling and options trading works recently (for obvious reasons).

How much weight do you give to an industry's overall performance? I'm probably not using the right terms here, so I will clarify some more: I’m specifically looking at the gaming market. Back in 2016 I was part of a (failed) startup in the Esports industry, and while I don’t have a background in business, our business major on the team researched market statistics so that we could present an accurate growth model to investors. One stat that they mentioned was YoY Growth, and from my understanding the gaming market at the time had an insane YoY. In 2016 the gaming market in the United States was predicted to grow to a value of 90 Billion, and to my current understanding it is at around 150 Billion today and projected to grow to 200 Billion by the end of 2021. So my question is this, does this statistic matter to investors when you look at companies in the industry? 

It seemed to be important to the angel investors we pitched to, but I don’t know if it is relevant to the stock market and IPOs. 

Another thing which I learned by being a part of that startup was that the typical wealthy investor is ancient. We gained some traction early on but once we got to the “top floor” so to speak we were pitching to a room of what may as well have been mummified corpses. After all our market research and pretty crayon graphs we reached the point where you answer questions and one of the first questions was: “So, your saying that people will pay to watch other people play video games?”. 

That was a pretty heavy blow, how would we explain the entire concept of Esports to these guys who hadn’t even heard of Twitch? Needless to say we did not receive investment that day. This lead me to believe that there is a serious lack of understanding of the gaming market among older (and richer) investors. Accordingly, I believe this is why we see younger Billionaires supporting Gamestop while hedge fund managers are in the news describing it as “the next Blockbuster”. Is there some credence to my belief that such a market thesis is wrong, and would any retailer that exists in an industry with such high growth be a good investment if you believed in their core business model?

TL:DR: Is Year over year growth of an industry as a whole important to you when looking at a specific company in that industry? 

Is it realistic to think a retailer in a high growth industry is going to go under without making serious mistakes?

Thanks for any input it would be much appreciated at this point in time. I'm having a hard time understanding the market thesis being touted on the news about "GME is Blockbuster 2.0"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on KE Holdings ($BEKE) **Intro**

**Own opinion**

KE is a long-term investment for me. They have a great growth potential. I really like the real estate sector, especially in such a large company like China, Also,  I started this DD some days ago. Today I read that ARK Invest also has invested in KE. And let’s be honest; everything Cathie touches turns into gold._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Short Selling Bad - A Video that Explains Why It Isn't This whole GME debacle has made many retail investors skeptical of the benefits behind short selling. Many people (in this subreddit and others) are of the thought that short selling is manipulative and a dirty practice used by hedge funds to profit off of sound investments.

This is why I wanted to share [this 12 year old video from khanacademy](https://youtu.be/zAkMhEqWFF0) that attempts to show the benefits from short selling.

Very important to note that this video was made at the height of the financial crisis and near the bottom of the stock market crash, so Sal has almost every reason to be critical of those who try to profit off of lies and deceit. Yet Sal does bring up many great points and does caution that short sellers who do actually manipulate the markets are bad, yet they are integral to an efficient and transparent market.

It also explains the crappy quality.

Anyway, I hope you learn something from this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Postal Service Replacement Vehicles- Discussion I came across a video from Donut Media about how outdated current USPS delivery vehicles are. They then went into how they’ll be replaced and the ~6 billion dollar contract that comes with them. Currently it’s narrowed down to 3 finalists but has been postponed due to COVID-19. The final 3 companies/ partnerships are Workhorse Group ($WKHS), Karsan and Morgan Olson ($KRSOF & no ticker found for Morgan Olson), and Oshkosh and Ford ($OSK & $F respectively.) I wanted to start a discussion on this and get some other peoples views on investment opportunities. Supposedly, a decision is expected to come out soon. 

With the big push towards EV vehicles I feel like workhorse has the best shot. Ford and Oshkosh are going with a regular gas engine while the other 2 manufacturers are going EV/ Hybrid. 

Not sure if someone has brought this up already if not and I’m sorry if I missed it.

I've been told high yield bonds are probably appropriate for this, but from doing some quick research it seems like they aren't all the same. I plan on holding the money here for about 2 years. 

Does anyone have recommendations for High Yield Bond ETFs and what kind of return can expect on these given the current market  state?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ risk mitigation: how can I soften the blow  

So, I bought GameStop towards the beginning of this whole debacle with 44 shares an average share price of about $250. I'll admit I let the greed get the best of me even though there were many times last week I simply wanted to just walk away with the money i didn't. Oh well..

All said and done, I'm currently down about 7k on this stock. I probably should just cut my losses but I feel like if the big boys have some tricks up their sleeves maybe so do some of you.

In the long term I was thinking about potentially averaging down my cost per share to try and sell at a break even if possible. This would obviously expose me to even more risk BUT... for example, say the price were to drop to around 20 dollars per share if I bought 500 shares this would bring my average cost to about $38.6. However, I've never done something like this so I'm not entirely sure how the math would work out in the end.

Obviously we don't know how to future of Gamestop will pan out, maybe it's worth around $100 in a few years like Chewy or it goes the route of KB toys and ceases to exist. What I do know is I played myself and took home a very expensive lesson lol._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME short interest down to 51% from S3 Partners Last week, GME holders were clinging to a data analysis by S3 partners that GME short interest was still high, even while other sources were claiming that many shorts had covered. Today S3 partners has updated to confirm that the majority of shorts are now covered. The short squeeze is over.  


[As of Jan 31 Ortex said that the number of shares on loan (a proxy for short interest was 30.28 million compared to 69.75 million shares outstanding and 46.89 in free float.](https://twitter.com/rationalsquad/status/1356083271524888580) Ortex's overall estimates for short positions was at 38 million down from 71 million last Monday.

Now [S3 partners has updated their data](https://twitter.com/rationalsquad/status/1356645940036304900?s=20) to show that GME is about 51% short.   


Unfortunately many of the GME bag holders are clinging to data from financial sites that only update every two weeks with a two week lag. Plenty of sites still show a high short interest. Some of which them show you that the data is current as of a certain date, many don't. Add this to the long list of reforms that are needed to increase transparency in the markets. Even the data from Ortex and S3 are based on their own fancy methodology, and are just estimates._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uber agrees to buy alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion Uber announced Tuesday it is acquiring alcohol-delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion in stock and cash.

Following the completion of the transaction, Drizly’s marketplace will be integrated with the Uber Eats app. The company will keep the standalone Drizly app as well, it said.

Founded in 2012, Drizly has become the leading on-demand alcohol delivery service in the U.S. and is available in 1,400 cities. The purchase could help drive people to use Uber’s app more often.

Uber Eats has been a key segment to Uber’s business amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has dramatically reduced the number of people leaving their homes.

“During this time our delivery business as been growing at extraordinary rates,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC on Tuesday. Drizly said it had more than 300% growth in the past year.

The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2021. Uber said that it anticipates that more than 90% of the consideration to be paid to Drizly shareholders will consist of shares of Uber common stock, and the balance will be paid in cash.

Uber stock was up more than 7% in the morning.

Uber has focused its acquisition efforts on its Eats segment during the coronavirus pandemic. After talks failed to acquire food delivery service GrubHub, Uber acquired Postmates last July.

At the same time, Uber has offloaded some of its more cost-eating transportation segments. The company last May transferred its electric bike and scooter business, Jump, to Lime. Uber also sold its self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group, to its start-up competitor Aurora Innovation on December 7, valuing ATG at approximately $4 billion at the time. Just a day later, it announced it was selling its flying taxi business, called Uber Elevate.

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at 3B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 575M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 6-8B.
* Alexander Tamas (AT) is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* AT previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and Mail.ru. His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to “self-deal” which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* AT has over 140M of his own dollars invested in VYGG common shares. This incentivizes him to only partner with a strong business that can truly grow over an extended period of time.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of Billions someday.
* Steve Huffman’s goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other “authentically”.
* Reddit has recently posted job openings for roles to lead an IPO of the company.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.

**What happens if I’m right and Reddit merges with VYGG?**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 41B, Pinterest - 43B, Snapchat - 83B.
* If reddit goes public for 6-8B then shareholders of VYGG could see a rapid revaluation up to 30-80B. That is between a 3 and 13x.
* Reddit has multiple communities of stock and options traders. Most notably [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) (WSB) which has grown from 1.8M members at the start of January 2021 to 8M today.
* WSB has a mentality of doing crazy YOLOs using OTM call options. Recently some in the community have been taking out student loans, leveraging them, and putting the cash into weekly expiry 100%+ OTM call options on companies.
* I am bringing this up not because it's a good approach too investing, but to illustrate the mentality that goes along with these trading communities. Those 8M members represent billions of investable dollars that could be used to bid-up the price of their favorite social media platform, Reddit.
* This means there will likely be a “mania” if/when Reddit goes public.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

* Alexander Tamas: VYGG Chairman - Social media and internet business expert.
* John Hering - VYGG CEO - Cyber security expert. Lots of experience scaling online platforms to millions of users. Strong aversion to the misuse of data. Fits with Reddits values.
* Hugo Barra - VYGG Board Member - Experience with expanding technology companies userbase internationally (Xiaomi). VP of VR at Facebook. Fits with social media narrative.
* Justin Kan - VYGG Board Member - Founder of Twitch.tv. Social media expert. Would be a useful Board Member for Reddit.

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $9.2 of cash is in the trust per common share so at my $10.20 cost basis I lose a dollar per share.
2. Medium case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share where I sell pocketing a 17-90% return in under two years.
3. Best case: I’m right and VYGG merges with Reddit. The market is still very expensive due to mass hysteria and low interest rates. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly punching up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 6-8B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell LEAP Put Options for income I'm considering a strategy to sell a put option with a long expiration date to earn income and would appreciate your opinions.

I know NOK is one of the RH stocks that saw crazy volatility last week (or was that the week before now? I'm getting confused!). I've been long the stock. It's been a pretty flat stock in my portfolio and it shouldn't be 7% of my portfolio, but hey still learning here.

I am having a hard time understanding this 8% drop today. With earnings coming this Thursday, and all "reports" pointing to a solid earnings report. Does this drop mean that some who "actually knows" what will be reported are starting to cover their positions? 

I guess I'm asking the following: Do drops in stock prices, right before earnings reports, point to the likelihood of bad news?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNM Analysis & Predictions I felt it was time for me to gather some thoughts about ShaMaran. Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility"

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.



The bond 

https://www.shamaranpetroleum.com/news/shamaran-proposal-to-bondholders-approved-122758/ 


We'll see what happens there. But I think we'll be surprised. With Lundin you can never know. "expect the unexpected" When i add up everything. ShaMaran has never looked more interesting. And had so many triggers for the stock lined up in the near future. Now there is only one direction for the stock and it is up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMMO INC ( POWW ) - A no brainer for gains - Pics and Reasons why I'm betting on POWW This'll be an updated version of my previous DD, I've answered some questions, done some more research and think these additional information should be added for yall to make a more informed decisions.

First of all, There has been a shortage of ammunition for quite a while now (half a year or more) so this is not something new. There are several company out there and most if not all of their online ammunitions are all out of stock as seen in the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/))

I will be focused on **Ammo Inc ($POWW)** and will provide the positives and negatives of the company and others (I will update these also based on questions and input from others).

# POSITIVE Thoughts

1. Positive note on the upcoming earnings, expecting a 272% growth year over year.
2. Increase in demand and popularity of its one of a kind specialty ammunition (STREAK Visual Ammunition) catered to military and law enforcement.
3. Increase in not just domestic contract but foreign contract.
4. One of the only company that owns a brass casing division where they can sell brass ammunition components for additional revenue.
5. Constructing new plants which is always a good sign of demand and growth
6. Increase in gun ownership grew more than 5 million in 2020.

# NEGATIVE Thoughts

* Democratic government means gun control, they will try to pass regulation to tax gun/ammunition
* High demand, ammo companies not being able to keep up with the order. Strictly bound by lack of components (primer, brass, etc...) from third party.
* Gain might already be priced in.

More details on the Positive thoughts below:

# 1. Positive note on the upcoming earnings

The company expects to achieve revenues of $55.0 million during fiscal 2021. Revenue in fiscal 2020 was $20.2 million which would represent 272% growth year over year. :

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html))

AMMO anticipates reporting in excess of $16.5 million in revenue for the third quarter of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year during the February 16th earnings conference call. Approximately 500% Year-Over-Year Revenue Increase.

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/))

# 2. Specialty ammunition

Their STREAK Visual Ammunition, tracer rounds *allow the military and police the ability to view their rounds' flight path* which can help you more easily spot impacts as well as missed shots, is increased in demand and popularity among the military and law enforcement. Additionally, STREAK ammunitions are non-incendiary and do not generate heat, so they're safe to use in places where many tracers have been prohibited.

There's more to it but you can read and do research from the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/))

Basically, these patented ammunition from Ammo Inc gives them a competitive edge against the conservative companies.

# 3. Foreign contracts

One of the few companies that contracts ammunitions overseas, many of which are foreign law enforcement agencies, and has been doing so consistently year over year as shown below:

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/))

# 4. Owns a Brass Casing Division (JMC)

Jagemann Munition Company (JMC), formerly known as Jagemann Stamping Company, is the brass casing division of Ammo Inc. They targeted the brass casing division in 2018 and closed the transaction in early 2019 for $27 million, rebranding the operations as Jagemann Munition Components (JMC). It has a reputation dating decades as being the best in class brass supplier to the ammunition and munitions industry.

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/))

# 5. Constructing new plant

The facility will support the Company’s plan to exponentially expand its manufacturing base of operations in the US and the increase of demand from over seas.

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html))

# 6. Increase in gun ownership

First time gun owner grew 5 million in 2020. Does not mean a continuous demand of ammunition but definitely is a plus for the industry:

([https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:\~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020).)

**My position on this is $7.50 30CALL 02/19/2021 & 400 Shares ( will most likely be selling my positions before or after the earning call )**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain the DD/IFF merger? 
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3656575-international-flavors-dupont-shares-diverge-as-merger-deal-completed

Dupont merged with IFF letting you exchange DD shares for IFF shares at a discount on the merger.

I elected not to exchange. I felt like DD getting the cash and a stake in IFF was good enough.

But now I’m confused because DD fell off a cliff monday. IFF is up nearly 20% since. What happened? Could i have sold DD friday and bought monday without consequence? The terms of the exchange are also confusing so im unsure how many IFF shares would become of the 20 DD shares I have owned for awhile.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Corsair - CRSR - Recent Activity and Earnings Play Posting some info on Corsair. Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.

What you need to know:

\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)

\- Earning's release for Q4: Feb 9th.

\- Announced release of new product (solid state drives) on Jan 28th

\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:

Net revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.

* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.
* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.

\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech

\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings surprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)

\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.

Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.

Analyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.

TLDR: buy CRSR.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $38.13

Edit: For people asking about the dip a few weeks ago and for those concerned about the announcement of non-diluted share offering at $35, here is my two cents: There are a lot of reasons for a company to issue shares: to raise money, to decrease volatility, to enrich themselves. That Corsair's execs have decided to sell some of their own shares at $35, is in my mind, a better alternative as it will not necessarily dilute the value of existing stock and it puts it out 'on the market', even if these institutional investors are unlikely to trade these often. This sale could mean the execs think it's not going to $50, but its just as likely they see $35 as a good price, attractive to both them and institutional investors, and they want to both take some money off the table , while simultaneously decreasing the volatility of the stock. The fact that the stock was $38 when they announced this, and that most investors bought in at $12 when CRSR IPO'd 6 months ago, is actually fairly bullish, to my mind. It basically indicates that institutional investors think CRSR is worth more than twice what they paid for it. My 2 cents.

Not financial advice. Positions: 2000 shares, $38 price average._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The quality of information on the internet and where to go when seeking the “truth”. - Learnings gathered over the last two weeks of research. **TL;DR: We’ve been bombarded with a shit ton of information over the last two weeks, and it’s important to take a step back and make inventory of it all. If it’s good information and truth you seek, the prudent thing to do is to do your research with all available avenues, and that means watching CNBC, and going on WSB. Maybe at the same time.**

---

I’m often asked where I get my investing ideas or “where I go for financial information” and I’ve always found that a difficult question to answer. That is because I have an (unhealthy) obsession with endlessly procuring information on a subject/company (provided it’s sufficiently interesting) but in doing so I’ve formed a long, yet reliable list of sources that I regularly use. After my voracious consumption of financial news over the last two weeks (I can’t be the only one!), I’ve decided to put pen to paper, my thoughts around the veracity and pervasiveness of information on the internet. 

There exists today a spectrum of information sources that can be loosely categorized into one of three categories: Media, Social Media, and Personal Resources. Conventional teaching states that information exists on a spectrum of quality, and while that may have been true for the last two centuries, the democratization of data has not only brought upon the **democratization of access, but also the democratization of quality**. You can find objectively good research on forums like /r/wsb and at the same time be grossly misinformed by what you hear on mainstream media channels. Below is my breakdown of all the different types of information on the internet, sorted by reach for the respective medium.

---

**Traditional Media (the greatest reach)**

* *Mainstream Media; (CNBC, WSJ, Bloomberg)* Mainstream media in its purest form is highly regulated, well vetted (for the most part) information that is disseminated through the crafting of “stories” that are meant to be consumed and not debated. Perspectives are often stated as facts, occasionally with devastating consequences, but this form of media remains the most universal and pervasive source of information even during the age of the internet.

* *Mass Media; (Yahoo Finance, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha)*; Tier 2 publications, one dimensional in nature but nonetheless with significant reach, are a step above in terms of sophistication, often with longer form analysis neatly packaged and easily proliferated. Quality of information varies significantly more than mainstream media but here is where more nuanced, detailed (public) opinions can be found.

* *Niche (but public) publications; (Short seller reports, Stock picking services, smaller financial news publications)* While definitely enjoying smaller reach than the largest communities and social media influencers, more niche resources found online still have value—granted you due your due diligence on the resource itself.

**Social Media (Medium amount of reach)**

* *Influencers (not going to name specific people, but you know the type)*; Influencers today carry a great deal of power, and it’s been proven time and time again they have the ability to move entire markets, sometimes well over an extended period of time. We’ve blown past the point of talking heads to the point where some figures are revered—often with good reason. Via social media, we are given access to some of the greatest thinkers of the modern era, considering their perspectives is absolutely something a prudent investor should do. Nonetheless, it’s important to identify these people as **people**, and **people** have biases, agendas, and underlying interests you will never learn about from a Twitter post.

* *Public Forums; (Reddit, YouTube, Twitter)* Sourcing information from communities is inherently a tricky concept, as the very nature of public forum invites discourse…for better or for worse. There is a significant upgrade to the quality of information the moment active discussion is facilitated, as ideas can immediately be challenged and debated over. Unfortunately, due to the (often) anonymous nature of discussion, the veracity of the source can vary wildly.

* *Niche communities; (Small YouTube channels, small subreddits, some podcasts)*; If you are patient enough to sift through some of the trash on the internet, here lies some of the best sources of information available. The sizes of these communities make them vulnerable to manipulation and misinformation, but the evergreen nature of these communities mean that plenty of high-quality information is put forth without any underlying agenda.

* *“Deep niche” communities*; This is wallstreetbets pre 2020, and like the internet as a whole, some of the best sources of information are often from the most degenerate. There is some incredible analysis that takes place in the dark recesses of the internet, that not only takes a lot of effort to dig for, but invested time spent distinguishing between gold and utter trash. Perhaps the most rife with discourse and discussion, these types of communities are less “communities” and more a jumbled mess of memes, trolling, and ridiculously high quality information.

**Personal Resources (little to no external reach)**

* *Immediate Friends, Family, Coworkers*; Gifted a modest network of knowledgeable peers, active discussion amongst one another is one of the best ways to bounce ideas and opinions off of one another. Yes, all of you are drawing from secondary sources, but active discussion of these ideas facilitated through conversation is often needed to weed out disinformation and low-quality analysis. Any quality investing thesis should be able live up to the basic scrutiny of your peers, regardless of the sources it is derived from.

* *Yourself*; Being able to apply critical thinking and your own personal biases to any investing thesis or idea is incredibly important and should never be discounted during your research. Being willing and able to aggregate all of the information you have collected and decipher a concise, accurate story is crucial to define your version of reality, from which you will do your analysis. Use your existing knowledge (obtained from books, school, online) and your past experiences to help guide you, and be equally willing to forgo these old opinions to form new ones. 

---

The point of this post is not just to dump a list of places you should begin to search for information, but to also push forward the idea that the traditional model of information quality (good information skews towards mainstream media) is no longer true. We’ve seen an almost identical increase in quality of information to match the increase in access, and this means to craft a well researched investment thesis (or to acquire an informed opinion on a particular topic), **to do proper due diligence, we have to explore all avenues of information** —from the front page of CNBC to the darker recesses of the internet. It’s a daunting task, but a small price to pay in pursuit of the *truth* which so often evades us in the current age where velocity trumps veracity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do we feel about REITS at the moment? Looking for diversity in my portfolio. REITS seem to be somewhat forgotten. Is there a reason we don't talk about these much anymore?

EDIT: To be clear, I'm genuinely trying to understand why they aren't currently more discussed, because they seem to have a lot to offer (solid growth potential, great dividends. If you accumulate the dividends, should have great potential for growth)

I cannot tell if investors are deliberately avoiding them for 'reasons', or, if people just feel the stock market offers far more

The downsides I am aware of include potential high volatility (if that bothers you), potential liquidity issues because the underlying assets are illiquid (though this may be less of a risk on traded ETFs), I also notice some of the funds I looked at are a mish-mash of equity and actual property holdings (so you may want to buy into the property market but actually just end up buying more stocks). That's about it really. Otherwise they look like a solid rival to stocks. Am I missing something?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA Earnings https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005625/en/

If it is not good, then this could bring another down leg.

Another down leg would mean the resurgence upward happening this morning Tues turns into another down draft.  That would mean the last market peak last week is not surpassed and a lower peak forms.  This is called a positive non confirmation.  It would seem no big deal, but the machines react to it by selling.

Having another stimulus is not guaranteed, and the last stim is already in the markets.

Businesses are still closing even though the pandemic is in essence peaked out.  Recessions begin looking like one thing and end looking like another.  The beginning of this recession is obvious - COVID 19 lock down induced.  The latter part of the recession would include foreclosures and evictions being allowed to happen, plus people becoming addicted to unemployment.

I am fairly new to this all and excuse me if I am talking nonsense. 

So I realize that ETFs have this thing called tracking difference. It says how accurate it is in tracking whatever it's tracking. And usually, it's like 1% or whatever off, because of administrative and transaction fees.

But are there ETFs that have tracking difference of 50%? E.g. if index goes -20%, ETF goes -10%. And if index goes +20%, ETF goes +10%?

[BAND](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/BAND) is in the Communication Platform as a Service industry. It is a close competitor to [TWLO](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/TWLO), so much so that BAND has a [page on their site](https://www.bandwidth.com/twilio-alternative/) about why they are “The smarter Twilio alternative”. Unlike TWLO, which acts as a middle-man by using other companies networks, BAND owns its own network. They say owning the network results in savings that they pass onto the customer, but BAND's gross margin is currently a bit below TWLO's (46.29% vs 51.54%). Perhaps in the long run, BAND's margins will be able to increase as they gain the benefits of scale.

I’m hoping the BAND will be able to produce similar returns that TWLO has in recent years because it’s:

&#x200B;

1. Starting to grow quickly
2. At a good value now
3. In a growing market

&#x200B;

1. Starting to grow quickly

Over the past four quarters, BAND’s revenue growth has accelerated from 18.46% to 40.12%. This trend looks like it should continue at least into the next quarter as the [company is expecting](https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-third-quarter-2020-financial-results) total revenue between $96.5-97.0M (\~56% growth). Its Selling/General/Admin and R&D expenses are still growing, but now at a lower rate than its revenue growth. This has helped the company to become operationally profitable, but not yet consistently bottom-line (net income) profitable.

Its Net Retention Rate is also increasing. Up from 116% a year ago to 131%. This is still behind TWLO, which is [at 137%](https://s21.q4cdn.com/963721274/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3'20-Earnings-Presentation_FINAL.pdf), but a strong figure nonetheless.

&#x200B;

2. At a good value now

BAND Price-to-Gross Profit Growth Ratio (similar to PEG ratio) is at 0.94. This is a bit above the median value for its industry, but well below TWLO at 1.41 (check out the [distribution feature](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) for this data). I think this is fine since BAND’s growth is one of the best in its industry and this growth is accelerating.

I’m using Gross Profit as my main comparison metric for a few reasons. I like that it takes into account the gross margin of the company. BAND has a lower gross margin than TWLO, so it should be penalised for this in the comparison. Using net income doesn’t make much sense since BAND is just missing out on making a profit, so its PE ratio is nonsensically low. The market caps in the software-infrastructure industry are correlated well with gross profit, so as gross profit increases, the market cap should increase in a similar step.

&#x200B;

3. In a growing market

As seen by both BAND’s and TWLO’s revenue growth, there’s plenty of room to grow in this market. TWLO’s management expects its total addressable market will reach [$87B by 2023](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/twilios-secret-growth-advantage%3A-its-own-customers-2020-11-26). Currently, their combined trailing-twelve-month revenue is $1.83B (TWLO: $1.54B; BAND: $292M). TWLO’s market cap is $52B vs $4B for BAND, so there’s plenty of room for it to play catch up.

TWLO offers a wider set of services than BAND, but I see this as more opportunities for the company. If it can continue to offer a lower price and higher quality than TWLO, as it claims it can, then it should be able to remain a strong competitor.

The reason for keeping half my shares in TWLO was largely a diversification play. BAND looks like good value now and is growing well. TWLO has a long history of growth and a wide product range. Given the size of the market, there’s plenty of room for them both. Since I’m not fully confident that one will outperform the other, I thought it best to own both.  


Edit: Expand the introduction._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gamestop Big Picture: Theory, Strategy, Reality *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

I've been looking into Solar, Electric Vehicle, and Rare Mineral associated stocks because of Joe Biden's transition to "cleaner" energy and the future potential for "long-term" growth in the industry (5-10 years or more). While researching, I noticed a notable prospect in General Motors and their announcement to switch from combustion engine vehicles to all-electric vehicles by 2035.

Given the size and scale of General Motors and their prominent (yet diminishing) presence in the American and foreign auto-industries, I believe there is great potential for stock growth. Some analysts have upgraded the stock price target from $50-ish to $80, among other excitable business prospects in the company and their multiple subsidiaries. Given that GM sold *roughly* 2 million cars in the United States (2019-2020) and 7 million vehicles worldwide (2019), I see great potential for a transition to the mass-scale production of electric vehicles.

General Motors has experimented with electric vehicles in the past (late 1990's-early 2000's), resulting in innovative technological successes without much consumer interest. At the moment, the fault in the company is the technological catchup General Motors will need to complete to "even the playing field" with established electric vehicle (EV) companies such as Tesla, although they are not alone. Looking at the business with a bullish outlook, I believe they can make the "leap" and leave other auto companies in the dust due to their large scale and semi-favorability among the American and Chinese auto-market. Compared to other combustion and electric car manufacturers in the United States, GM seems to have kept a market sales lead despite various consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.

I just like the stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help understanding basics of making less-risky options trading I'm fairly new to investing and the options lingo has a lot of overlapping terms,making it hard to google answers.

Lets say I think that stock ABC is going to drop significantly in the next 2 months. I would like to use options to profit off of that, but I don't want to short because I'm not comfortable with unlimited downside in case I'm wrong.  I also do NOT own any ABC stock.

My understanding is I can do the following:

1. Buy a "put option" as "buy to open". This gives me the right, but not the obligation, to sell ABC stock at the strike price by the given date. For this privilege, I pay a premium upfront. 
2. I would not want to "buy to close" as this would be "shorting" and leave me on the hook to cover the position (though without paying a premium).
3. Since I don't have stock in ABC I could *not* exercise the contract even if it were "in the money" (profitable), but I CAN sell it to someone who has stock in ABC who would want to exercise to offset their losses. 

Questions:

1. Are the above all fully correct? I really don't want to accidentally buy the wrong thing and be on the hook.
2. If that's all right, how does part 3 work? I don't see in my Ameritrade window a place to buy and sell existing options on an options market.

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8ogt7/the_green_rush_weedstocks_us_legalization/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Aphria & Tilray are poised for significant growth*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Potential Liquidity Fueled Bubble Hello All,

So i'm going to say upfront that I really hope that my analysis here is wrong. The fact that literally, NO ONE I've seen is talking about this indicates to me that I have to be wrong. But every way I look at it I come to the same conclusion. I'm really new to the investing game, but I have known about how financial markets and how the systems around them work since I was a kid though as my father is a trader for an oil company. So I'm not a complete idiot at least. A lot of this is parroted from other sources, some of which are even from reddit, though I have lost the posts I pulled from so I can't cite them. But I'm not INTENTIONALLY plagiarizing at least. I've posted about this in the wallstreetbets community but they are both idiots and so focused on the GME yolo train that they don't seem interested in anything else. I really hope that someone here can look at my analysis and point out where I'm wrong. So by reading and commenting you are doing me a huge favor so I appreciate it. I'm going to drop the TL;DR at the top and my evidence below.

TL;DR The behavior of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) of the last 20 years has created a market bubble with the value of the US Dollar. Their policies are based around constant and accelerating growth of GDP that is not a realistic goal from a practical perspective as even if there was the possibility of this there is always forces outside the market that affect GDP growth. (Such as a pandemic) As a result, the value of money in the economy is far far greater than the value of the actual dollars that exist. This has created a massive, if yet unseen, bubble that is bound to burst eventually with no real way for the Fed or the government to do anything about it. My expectation is that when this GME rocket goes off in the mother of all short squeezes we will see MASSIVE de-grossing and as a result a steep fall in the value of the stock market over all. Which will in turn cause a run on the banks just like what happened in the depression. When that happens the system will come completely unglued as since not only is there not enough cash on hand to give everyone, the debt backed by that money will no longer be collateralized so everyone is going to come knocking for their money. This sudden evaporation of "money" in the economy that's generated by debt will cascade and drive the value of the dollar to at or near 0. Triggering a global economic collapse.

The behavior of the Fed in the last 20ish years has been to progressively reduce the interest rate that they will loan money to banks to cover their minimum cash on hand amounts by law. This functionally increases the liquidity and availability of money in the form of debt as it allows the banks to make increasingly large amounts of loans for a profit. There's more going on under the hood than just the interest rate but it's historically the primary way that the Fed manages inflation and money supply. 

The Fed can't make large changes to the interest rate because to do so would not only shake confidence in the system but trigger amplification of the inflation/deflation effects on GDP, which in turn can further reduce the GDP due to decreased confidence by those with money to invest. You also don’t want to suddenly massively increase your money supply because this will amplify any effects increased money velocity has on inflation. Increased inflation will also lead to less savings and more people spending money as soon as they receive it. So gradually over time the Fed has decreased the interest rates to the point whereas of March last year they were effectively 0.

There is massive wealth inequality in the united states. This is not any new information to anyone. But why this matters is that a wealthy individual is far more likely to invest any money they get either through legitimate gains or through increased money supply by the fed than a "regular" person would be. This in turn makes it to where rather than circulating back into the economy as regular purchases of conventional goods like bread, milk, cheese, gas. etc. this money goes into investments such as the stock market. This is where the velocity of money comes into play. In short, the "velocity" of money is the rate at which it changes hands, usually due to the purchase and sale of real goods. Over the last 20 years the velocity of money has gone down dramatically as the wealth gap gets bigger and bigger.

The decreased interest rate has added more and more money into the economy through loans/debt. The new money supply, through loans, would be mostly issued for consumption, like a mortgage to buy a new house or a new car loan to buy a car. This will have the added benefit of increasing the velocity of money because this new money supply is recycled into the economy. After 2008, the Fed had to find a new mechanism, with interest rates being permanently too close to zero to have any meaningful impact on the money supply to actually help anything, especially since most Fed board members think that negative interest rates are a bad idea. With quantitative easing, direct purchases of treasuries artificially lowers the yields of treasuries and makes bonds and equities relatively more attractive when looking at risk / reward, inflating prices of those securities. We’ve effectively reached 0% yield on the risk-free-rate during the last crisis, so the next logical step for the Fed was to buy other securities, like commercial paper and now bonds. Except the biggest holders of treasuries and bonds were actually corporations and high-net-worth individuals, who compared to regular people have a much lower propensity to consume, and would not at all address the lowering velocity of money. It also leads towards higher wealth inequality, as it inflates prices of those securities, and all other financial assets which are concentrated at the top corporations and individuals, which tends to be bad for velocity of money. In simplified terms, the increase in money supply goes towards the people who already held a lot of wealth. This is probably why we’re seeing a steep drop-off of money velocity after 2008, even after the economy has recovered.

Then you throw a pandemic into this. Suddenly all the variables are changing rapidly with the economic shock of the effects of the disease. This causes a dramatic drop in the velocity of money. At the same time we're having the biggest sudden drop in GDP in history, at the scale of the Great Depression. The positive feedback loops mean that if the Fed is not able to expand the supply of money enough, we’ll quickly see a deflationary spiral. If they do too much, we quickly get into hyperinflation. The Fed has pretty much maxed out on everything they could have possibly done to keep inflation at 2% by increasing the money supply using tools they’re allowed to use. Interest rates and the risk free rate have been near 0% since 2008, and bond yields are already at unrealistic levels for the amount of risk they have, resulting in a skyrocketing increase in equities. Since none of these actually address the velocity of money issue, which has sharply decreased since March, we’re probably going to head towards a deflationary spiral.

This has lead to a situation where the true "value" of the money in the banks is way different than the value of the debt loaned out to the various parties buying assets in an effort to get greater returns on their investment than they would if they took a "risk free" stance. Hence the bubble. To put it another way, for every 1 "real" dollar in the banks there are many more dollars circulating in the economy/stock market due to collective debt and risk management.

The "risk free" investment of treasury bond's rate of return has reached effectively 0. So everyone is dumping their bonds, some of which aren’t even getting any bids when being sold, even briefly going into negative territory. Add on the fact that a substantial amount of non-US debt is denominated in US dollars, meaning governments and corporations around the world are trying to get their hands on USD to cover their debt payments with reduced revenue. The skyrocketing corporate bond yields make it virtually impossible for companies, even the ones with strong balance sheets, to raise their much-needed cash to survive through bond issuance.

How much longer can this last? Fed funds rates are already effectively stuck near zero; even in the “booming” economy that we’ve had the past decade the Fed was barely able to raise the repo rate past 2% before the stock market started crashing in late 2018 and was never able to meaningfully unwind their balance sheet from all the quantitative easing they did in the Great Recession. Now they’ve put their liquidity injection program on steroids with infinite QE. They’ve reduced the risk of corporate bonds by saying they will be the bag holder if things go bad.

The key takeaway here is that increased liquidity from the Fed causes inflation of asset prices. And at the moment we are at or near maximum liquidity in the economy due to the gradually changing economic policies by the Fed. In an effort to maintain constant "growth" of the economy during the financial recessions of 2008 and now 2020 the Fed has made the bar for banks ability to loan money (that they don't actually have mind you as they are using debt to do so) so low that with the effective 0% interest rate they can loan out as much as they want since they can just buy the reserve cash they are required to by law for a rate FAR lower than they can get the buyer of the loan to pay.

All of this has made the value of the single dollar in the bank is far less than the value it produces in the economy. Remember the bubble part from earlier? Well this is that but on a massive unprecedented scale. Now this could continue for a while and inflation will continue, but the velocity of money will continue to go down and the wealth gap will continue to increase. This increased gap in wealth has made it to where a greater and greater percentage of wealth is in the hands of investment groups like hedge funds which themselves operate off of taking both long and short positions to "hedge" their risk, which is thereby rewarded by increased ability to buy due to the confidence the banks/investors have in the hedge funds. So if you as a hedge fund have 1 dollar and your creditor gives you access to 10 dollars for your long positions as long as you promise to take a 10 dollar short position as well. This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk, but in reality your 1 dollar is exposed to 20 dollars worth of risk.

Then comes along wallstreetbets. They notice the massive overshorting of GME stock. They take this opportunity to trigger the mother of all short squeezes to spike the price of the GME stock and sell at the top for huge gains. In other words, as the meme stocks like GME go up the highly leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. This is called grossing / de-grossing and as a result of this massive sell off of other assets, be it stocks, bonds, commodities, what have you. Cause the price to drop. You can see this in the effect the GME thing has had on the overall stock market just last week. What makes this worse is that since the price of the GME stock has risen the financial market sees the short position as increasingly lucrative as once the squeeze is over if they can bear through it they will see great returns. This causes a feedback loop as the GME buyers buy more and more of the shorted stock the price rises, which causes the price of other assets in the stock market to fall. And since the GME stock is so over shorted there is theoretically no limit on how far this could go.

So when the short squeeze on GME begins there is going to be an unfathomably large amount of de-grossing causing the value of all other assets to hit the floor. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so if GME (and other common shorts) skyrockets the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis.

This would be very bad obviously. But to make it even worse, when the GME bubble does burst all the wealth that's been put into it basically disappears. If it were just major firms that were getting the gains from this they could conceivably reinvest in the now catastrophically low valued stocks. But as a practical matter this is unfeasible as the time between the GME rocket and the reinvestment the run on the banks will have already happened. Additionally, so many of these shareholders are now low net worth individuals and they are far more likely to "consume" such as paying off debt or charitable giving such as we've seen on the WSB subreddit already. The sudden decrease in net value of the stock market will trigger a panic and just like in the great depression a run on the banks. Which the bank obviously can't cover because they have loaned out so much of their money that they don't have even a fraction of the ability to return actual dollar bills to their customers. Making this EVEN WORSE the fact that the debt accrued by the banks is so overvalued when the stock market crashes all their loans become basically worthless so not only do they not have no cash on hand from the run on the bank, they don't have any means to recoup the losses from the loans.

All this to say, the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 20 years has artificially increased the supply of money without actually printing more money. As a result, the value of the stock market is several times greater than the companies that make it up are actually worth. This is going to see an economic crash not just on the scale of the great depression, but several times greater than that. Plus the "bubble" here is not tulips, or mortgage-backed securities, but of the dollar itself. So when this collapse happens the value of the dollar will become basically nothing. As the world's reserve currency this will trigger a worldwide collapse, which will trigger an international run on the banks, which will have their own problems respective to their economies financial policies.

I have NO idea how to stop this. If it weren't GME now, it'd be something else in the future, we're just seeing it now due to the massive acceleration of interest in the GME stock due to wallstreetbets and it's subsequent exposure to the main stream media. There aren't any tools left in the Feds toolbelt to get this under control. Even if the SEC froze all purchase/sales of the GME stock (which would be incredibly unpopular anyway) that would only be a temporary solution as eventually some other stock will see this problem and we'll have to go through it all over again.

This isn't just bad, this is apocalyptically bad. And that's not hyperbole. It could realistically cause the complete collapse of the global economy. There won't just be bread lines, there will be no bread for ANYONE to have.

My earlier mentioned trader father believes this will cause essentially what happened in the great depression. But this isn't a great depression. This is potentially the collapse of the entire system. During the depression, the stock market didn't hit zero. Not even close. Additionally, there is no "gold standard" to get off of like there was in the depression. ALL of our money is fiat currency and is only backed by our collective faith in the government to continue to exist. But that goes out the window now, no one will believe the government can pull us out of this.

If you've made it this far and think I'm missing something or have too few brain wrinkles then downvote the shit out of me. But I don't think my analysis here is flawed. I really, truly, and sincerely hope I'm wrong. If what I proposed here goes down it will be unspeakably bad. So seriously, if you have an alternative viewpoint or idea to help solve the problem. I'd LOVE to hear it.

Even if every member of WSB became a millionaire because of sick gains from GME, if that triggers the run on the banks and subsequent devaluation of the USD those millions of dollars might not even buy you more than a handful of tendies.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you think about Petco and Coinbase IPO this year? I've been trying to research and coinbase is great solely because cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular. They also charge a fee for when you want to withdrawal so they always make money even if you don't. 

Petco is great because they still have retail stores and they're stepping up their e-commerce. They also are getting involved with the veterinary world.

Anyone have more information and research on them as to why they're great businesses to get behind?!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ETNs too good to be true? I've been a long-time leveraged ETF investor (with typically \~30% of my portfolio) but the effects of beta-slippage and occasional poor tracking of the underlying index have always been difficult to factor in when making investing decisions. It's fairly hard to forecast medium-term and long-term volatility and how that might impact portfolio performance.

I have been researching ETNs and so far they seem an excellent alternative to hold vs. leveraged ETFs for the following reasons:

1. No short term capital gains tax
2. Far better tracking of the underlying index
3. Don't have to worry about beta slippage
4. The risk of a bank/lender defaulting seems (to me) extremely low unless we have a repeat of 2008 and the bank collapses

Can someone please poke holes in the logic above?
