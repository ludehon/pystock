It’s gonna be a while before I even make my first investment because I want more knowledge on the topic and I have a daughter on the way which will be time consuming.

But my question is to the investors and traders that have been around for a while, when did you get that AHA! Moment or when did stocks really start to make sense to you when you where learning and studying them ?

How long was it before you can look at a stock and it wasn’t just numbers and colors you can actually see strategic outlooks on the board ?

Or is there no aha moment you just kind of sink in to things and piece them together slowly ?

Everyone knows that gun sales go up before Democrat politicians take office and when there is social unrest. I’m going to assume you all have seen the news in DC today, Ruger is up 12% for the day.

The only stipulation I have is that I’m not quite sure how much more Ruger can rally off potential chaos. Any ideas? 

Also, my main concern is how weak today’s incident makes the US look. Foreign adversaries, particularly China, are going to love this shit.

Pros/cons ??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just a reminder to please take investment advice from social media with a grain of salt... there's a disturbing trend with "TikTok Investors" offering risky advice, especially now trying to capitalize on recent stimulus checks I saw this twitter account @TikTokInvestors where they screen cap some highly cringey stock "gurus" on Tiktok (aka Fintok) giving some crazy advice ([Article on all of this in case you do not want to put yourself through some painful TikToks](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1njqf7rw75qyx/Welcome-to-FinTok-Where-Day-Trading-Options-Investing-and-Misinformation-Reign)).

**Just a reminder to take investment advice from social media with a grain of salt.** ^Except ^for ^mine, ^NIO ^to ^the ^moon! ^/s

For example,["Index Funds SUCK, buy my portfolio instead"](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1333767727991857152?s=20). Most of it is just [people talking into their cameras boasting high returns and advertising a paid "class" of their's where you can learn their secrets](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343606698896973825?s=20), or just [risky as hell advice like "IPO's can only go up" so you should invest in Doordash](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1336360876169785344?s=20)

*Especially with the stimulus package*, there's some [very predatory videos](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1344410208429289474?s=20) claiming you should use that [$600 "stimmy" and get RICH QUICK](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1346139667939340289?s=20) like them by investing in their specific stock portfolio that is GUARANTEED to go up (because past performance = guarantees right?).

I'd hope that no one in their right mind would listen to this shit but there is a [massive audience on Tiktok](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343613688767422464?s=20) that this sort of misinformation is targeted at, ie. GenZ/young investors that may only know of the stock market as of 2020. From the article I posted at the beginning on these tiktok investors:

> “You’ve only been investing since April and have only seen a bull market since then,” they added. “Because you’re talking about money, you have hundreds of thousands following you because everyone wants to make money. You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”
> 
> Take, for example, @kriskrohn. Kris Krohn is a Gary Vee-style motivational speaker who offers mentorships on real estate investing.
> 
> On TikTok, he recommends that followers forgo investing via a 401(k), calling the accounts, “fake funny money,” that you “can’t use” and “can’t invest.” Instead, he advocates that his 250,000 followers invest in real estate.
> 
> Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.

If these financial moguls were so filthy rich from their investments, why are they *selling* a class for a fee? They could easily make exponentially more by simply using their secret strategies and investing more rather than spend their time getting $20 from a teenager on tiktok...unless that's how they actually make money??

Hello! To give you a bit of context, I have little capital to work with and I have been eyeing a few companies lately. I have done my DD on them and I made a call that purchasing warrants would give me better ROI in the long term - allowing me to also save up enough capital to exercise it.

**One company, in particular, has had multiple underwritten offers issuing warrants with a different strike price from one another.** Not to mention a different strike price for the warrants sold on the IPO. I did some research on IPO's and found out that on traditional IPOS's, underwriters would buy all the shares from the company and sell it to their pickings of institutional/private investors and more. Only after they had their fill will the stocks actually go public on the market.

A clause in the SEC filings for the underwritten offerings states that "The shares of common stock or the pre-funded warrants, and the accompanying common warrants, **can only be purchased together in the offering** but will be issued separately and will be immediately separable upon issuance."

**Do underwritten offerings work the same way? And if so, when buying a warrant on the market, how do you know which warrant with the specified strike price you are buying given the multiple underwritten offerings?**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ENB, ACO.X, and TRP All 3 of these stocks are down and have relatively high dividend yields.

1) What is the advantage that Shift have on the competitors?
Let me explain.
From what i understand the biggest advantage,is that they sells online and deliver cars at your home,and they allow you to do a test drive.
But such an offer is not easily replicable by the competitors,even those that don't sell online?


2)Why i shoul sell my car to them rather than others companies?
They pay a lot?


3)Why i should buy a car from them rather than the others competitors?

[BETZ vs. DKNG] [JETS vs. LUV] [MGM vs. CZR] When it comes to ETF's vs Stocks which would be the better buy between these pairs. I own positions in all but would like to just choose one and increase my position in them. Right now I'm about 50/50 in each.

\[BETZ vs. DKNG\]

BETZ has DKNG and PENN but in small percentages (\~5%) so a big rise in DKNG would not show very well in the ETF but it is less volatile in the end. I so see DKNG being a leader in the field but the ETF has more diversity in the whole online gambling sector.

\[JETS vs. LUV\]

JETS has a large stake in LUV with around 10% which is nice and the second biggest being DAL at around 9%. Both really good companies so I can see JETS increasing nicely once things get back to normal. However there are many other airlines in there that aren't as good and may not be around if the pandemic continues. LUV is awesome with domestic travel and I believe that is what everyone will be doing once the pandemic ends but who knows. They also have a great balance sheet same with DAL.

\[MGM vs. CZR\]

MGM has its online sports booking (Betmgm) but also owns a ton of the Las Vegas strip. Growth potential is huge when things get back to normal and people flood to Las Vegas. I feel the same way about CZR but after they merged with El Dorado they've had a pretty good run but could definitely go higher. I'd rather remove one and put it in the other.

They are all over the world_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ America V China: Their leading stocks and predictions moving forward into 2021 **China**

China is the world's second-biggest economy - it's big. As in 1.4 billion people big. I think it's highly likely that it will overtake the US within the next decade. It's the heavyweight of manufacturing, global exports, and it is the world's biggest food producer. Between 1977 and 2017, China's economy grew almost 10,000%. Let that sink in. The biggest banks are no longer Citi or JP Morgan; the top players are all Chinese. If you have heard or read about the "Great Firewall" you will know about the billionaires that own Tencent and Alibaba. There's been a lot of people speculating to sell Alibaba because Jack Ma has gone missing. Some are arguing that one should sell BABA because it is doomed and some - who I would have to side with - are saying buy the dip as it will rise back up once the politics have been resolved. Just today I saw that NYSE reversed their decision to de-list 3 Chinese telecom companies. Once the news broke, the firms’ stock prices surged. This is a good signal that international relations are improving - i.e., quite unlikely that China will liquidate BABA. There are a lot of US and EU investors in BABA, Tencent, and more to come. Also, if China did do that, imagine the trade-war that America would unleash. You also have to consider how China wants to keep growing and to do this, they need a free flow of money. 

China has a complicated relationship with global financial markets and is basically a communist country. You have state intervention that you would never see here in the West. Quick history lesson: Foreign investors not that far back were unable to buy any Chinese shares. However, since allowing it (*see: QFII program, circa 2002*), the flow of free money, Chinese stocks have grown. Ask yourself, are China now suddenly going to reverse this boom? Who really knows, but I highly doubt it. 

It is worth noting that foreign ownership is capped at 30%. If Chinese investors dumped a given stock, foreign investors (that's me and you) could find themselves inadvertently holding more than 30% and then be forced to sell at market price - which would probably be pennies. Under Xi Jinping, the Govt's control has been getting tighter - meaning that a stock's fortune could change suddenly. However, markets in China are used to benefit the Chinese people. In short, if the market moved in a way that was not beneficial to China's rise, the Chinese Govt would not hesitate to intervene. So, a good question to ask yourself when investing in companies like BABA and Tencent is: Do these stocks benefit the Chinese Govt?? To help answer this, look at Chinese Funds and Chinese Institutional Investment as well as knowing that they already own 70%. If the answers are yes, I think it unlikely that the Govt would put a grenade under their best-performing stocks. The biggest issue with Chinese stocks is their accounting and auditing - -this becomes less of an issue for large-cap stocks. 

The US-China trade war has taken its toll on China. Harsh tariffs on Chinese goods have reduced demand for their products as well as reduced profit margins. Because of this, their manufacturing industry shrank throughout 2019. Risk-averse investors will probably want to wait on the sidelines and wait for a resolution to be reached. However, as some famous guy once said 'Buy when others' are fearful'. China also has many other problems such as a shrinking population and the national debt is increasing, meaning they want their companies to be as successful as possible. They can't afford to simply write off companies - profitable ones at that - to simply "show Jack Ma who's boss". Granted they will give him a dressing down, strip him of his assets; or even put him in jail. But hurting their own companies?? This doesn't make sense. 

***Prediction:*** I am Bullish on both BABA and Tencent. I actually love Tencent because of their 40% holdings in Epic Games. Clue: Unreal Engine > Mandalorian. 

**America**

Tech companies in the US have been getting bigger, and bigger (especially during the Coranavirus pandemic). Unless you've been asleep, you would have seen that Amazon wants to relocate its operations to Cyprus (link:[https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020)). If this happens, their presence would be so immense they would literally be able to buy political influence across all levels and lobby for tax rebates. The Cyprian Govt would happily lobby for the company in the EU Parliament. The EU would not allow this and would enforce sanctions against Amazon as well as teaming up with the US Govt to fight such a monopoly. We live in a democracy and we've been quite successful for a few centuries now. If we suddenly had a superpower rising that would create an imbalance in the system. For instance, the profits of Amazon circa 2009 grew from less than $1BN to $10BN in 2019. However, the amount of federal tax it pays is close to zero. With the US Govt (and many others) short on cash due to printing/borrowing money, they will need large corps to start paying their fair share of tax (and then some). Meaning profits will go down moving forward. There is an active effort by the US and EU Govts to punish these kinds of monopolies. Many IBs and Strategists see all these tech giants - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook - being persecuted by the Govt. 

If you have been holding tech stocks for a long time like me, good for you. Keep your stocks. However, if you are new to the game of investing, I would consider personally ETFs in tech rather than the stock itself. For example, the QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 and has about 50% of its holdings in Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 

***Prediction:*** After seeing Amazon & Microsoft, trade sideways for 5months now, I do think they will reach another peak soon from Covid-related sales, however, I do think that will be short-lived. Apple and Google have seen massive rises over the last 6-months. Apple was because they are going to start making cars, which will take a long time. It took Tesla almost 17 years. I see the upside for these stocks being modest gains, while the downside will most likely be what's happened to me: "Opportunity Cost" - whereby your money will be tied for months on end doing nothing. Neither up nor down.

Netflix is looking to swing big by Jan 22..

Article copied below:

 

Investors in **Netflix, Inc.** NFLX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 22, 2021 $770.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

### What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

\- ADVERTISEMENT -

### What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Netflix shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Broadcast Radio and Television industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.37 per share to $1.38 in that period.  


Given the way analysts feel about Netflix right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling stocks (strategy, not 'when to') I have seen the "sell at 20-25%" or "reevaluate the holding/analysis" and recently read "sell initial investment and keep the rest as free shares"...I thought this last one was interesting because you can do vice versa and sell the profit but keep initial investment in?

Streaming hours is relevant because advertisers are willing to pay more as account engagement rises, which is a multiplier on revenue growth. 

Something interesting to note - among advertisers with total spend greater than $1 million, Roku had a 100% customer retention rate, which indicates a high level of satisfaction with Roku's ad platform.

So, Goodfood Market is a Canadian company which delivers the groceries for predetermined meals including the recipe etc. I assume it's quality groceries, e.g. free range, organic, not too bad for the environment etc., so every millennials/big city persons dream.   


I'm from Europe and we have HelloFresh here as the biggest player in the market [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HFG.F/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HFG.F/) (12B in Market Cap). My first question, in North America, which are the similar companies that does this? Like, in the US, there gotta be someone who does something similar like HelloFresh and this Goodfood Market? The usage of companies like these have exploded during corona, the question is just how many people are going to continue use it? Environment, health, animal rights, financial independence are all super in topics right now. I could imagine many young professionals living in big cities using services like these? You save time, you don't have to get creative (they do it for you), you eat healthy, there is something about cooking your own meal and compared to eating out, it is just cheaper.   


Can someone tell me the competitors here? I would assume a Canadian company would enter the US market at some point if it booms. The market cap is less than 1B, but it had huge growth lately. Again, if someone with a strong economic background could throw some facts at me I would really appreciate it.

In fact, the losses endured by Tesla shorts were more than the short losses for the next nine companies -- combined. Losses on No. 2 Apple (AAPL) in 2020 came to $6.7 billion, which is only slightly more than Tesla shorts lost in the month of December alone. Amazon (AMZN) cost the shorts $5.8 billion, according to S3.

Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020, which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher, as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions.

But the year ended with short investors still holding roughly 5.5% of Tesla's shares, which equates to a $31 billion bet against the company's future prospects.

Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities & Real Estate just finished in the red.

Most small & mid-cap value & core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil& Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.

The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.

We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index & supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.

If the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it’s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big & important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn’t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any “big tax changes” or any other “big regulation changes”. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn’t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay & WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don’t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.

Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN’s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.

Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more & more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development & future outlook for the company before. I think both GM & Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling & portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.

Curious to hear your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investors: The case for BBBY! I'm  looking to increase my BBBY position to 2-3% of my entire portfolio  today, with the end goal of 4-5% to DCA post-earnings / see post-earnings movement.  Why?!  Three big reasons.

&#x200B;

1. **Leadership and Potential**:  BBBY is a "**start up with the financials of a fortune 500 company**."   BBBY, over the last year, changed its entire management team.  A new  group of senior executives with experience ranging from amazon, target,  nike, etc.  Check out their video and look up some of their names.   Incredible turnover of leadership. [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vfyg6s3k](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vfyg6s3k)  And they've done some good work over the past year.  BBBY only has to  beat itself.  I'm not saying this will be the next 200 dollar stock.   But at 20 dollars a share, a rise to 40 alone would be 100%.  This stock  has been beaten down so badly (and rightfully so); however, I think the  drive from this leadership team can really do the company some good.   This leadership team is focused on investing in the company, cutting out  excess that doesn't work, and zeroing in on what captured BBBY as a  leading brand many years ago.
2. BBBY is already **streamlining its stores**.   They are closing down stores that were in close proximity to each  other so they are not in direct competition with each other.  Closing  down stores will help them save money, and it shouldn't hurt their sales  because of their proximity to others.  They are also changing the  interior design of their stores to inspire consumers to purchase various  set-ups as opposed to individual pieces.  There are powerful articles  in consumer-psychology around the detriments of choice.  When there is  too much to choose from, the brain becomes more hesitant and indecisive.   BBBY is changing the layout of their stores to reflect this.  By  inspiring consumers first with entire set-ups, they are locking  consumers in on what they want, which helps them focus on the particular  products they are looking for.  They are also increasing their online  marketplace presence and bettering the user experience.
3. The  macrotrend of **remote work and the demand for home-based goods is likely to last**.  Many companies are now grappling with remote vs office work.   Some big names already came out and said that remote work will be in  place for all of their employees until the summer of 2021.  I think many  companies will realize that a hybrid of remote/office work is  preferrable.  It can save companies money as they do not need to have a  bigger office space and, arguably, it increases the efficiency of their  employees.  It's about how well you work, not how much.  Post-pandemic, I  don't think we'll have a full 180 reversal of everyone going back into  the office.  Remote work will definitely leave its footprint, and that  gives BBBY potential to grow.

For a further look into some of the moves BBBY has made:  [https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/](https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/)

Check out a number of youtube videos on the stock! (wasn't allowed to post them for some reason, but the info is out there!)

Quite frankly, for all the shit FB gets these days for seemingly being The absolute end all be all epitome of evil; the simple fact is nothing in life is free. Facebook makes money off of selling your data for ads. In exchange, you get unparalleled internet access and connectivity across the globe, for no out of pocket costs.

Meanwhile, for a similar level of experience through Apple, you have to pay Apple a considerable amount out of pocket. Ok. Fine.

Yes, they track your data in exchange for targeted ads...in order to continue providing a service for no out-of-pocket costs to the user (which, believe it or not, out-of-pocket costs are kind of a big deal if you don't make a lot of money).

The race to build a self-driving car has been one of the hottest topics in the media (after COVID of course) and it seems that everyone is looking for whether it is possible as opposed to whether it is needed or solves a problem.

Modern cars have cruise control and the newest models (notably Tesla) have perfected it to a point where little intervention seems necessary in long trips. Is the jump to absolutely self-driving cars really necessary? What difference does it make? So that passengers can sleep behind the wheel or drink? I would think regulators would forbid this even in the case of self-driving cars as there would always need to be a failsafe or someone behind the wheel who can intervene in emergencies.

Personally I enjoy driving short to medium distances and even longer ones aren't that bad every now and then. It just seems like something companies are putting so much money and effort into without really meeting a broad costumer demand.

**So for this example, let's use Tesla...the gains would be:**

ITM Call option - $750 strike and $6.95 premium

OTM Call option - $800 strike and $0.63 premium

((($800- $750) - ($6.95-$0.63)) \* 100) = **$4,368 MAX gain if the stock price goes past $800 strike** \- is this correct?

**If the current stock price is 753, and by January 8,2021 (call expiration dates) the stock price rises above the $800 OTM call option that I sold and ends up ITM, then do I need to supply the 100 shares to the person who is most likely going to exercise the call option?** This seems super risky to me, and I don't understand why people are doing spreads then if there is a chance you need to supply 100 shares.

What do you all think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New Year, new mindset. I’m looking at you beginners. **Best time to invest was yesterday**

List in no particular order. Hope this helps.

1. Stop trying to time the market. Time in the market beats timing the market.

2. Owning fractional is perfectly fine. How many shares you own is irrelevant.

3. Buy on a schedule, you can’t time the market.

4. If you don’t have an individual stock to contribute to, hold cash for an opportunity or keep contributing to your ETFs.

5. Stop asking us for individual stocks suggest. You wont know when to get out or why you actually own it. Own what you know.

6. Stay away from penny stocks. It’s high risk you’re not ready for it.

7. It’s ok to have a collection of ETFs vs owning individual stocks.

8. Don’t track dollar amount but what your % return is. You get out what you put in. It’s all relative to % of movement.

9. Have an exit plan for individual stocks.

10. Stop saying “I know it’s not much” it’s something and it will grow. By investing when you’re under 30 you’re doing yourself a huge favor later in life than you know and way ahead of your generation or even your parents.

11. **Patience, Patience, Patience**

12. Understand what your stock allocation % of each security takes up of your net worth.

13. **Do your research** DD = due diligence

14. Not a single person knows what’s going to happen to the market if they say they do, walk away.

15. YouTube! Learn but check the credentials of said creator first. There are plenty of certified individuals teaching.

16. Ask for book’s recommendations.

17. Taxes and how they apply to your income, dividends, special dividends. 

18. Your wealth is in your hands not anyone else._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can anyone help Hi I'm currently trying to find , watch and potentially buys stocks in MSTR  I'm currently using apps like etoro and plus500 but can't seem to find MSTR stock on either can anyone send me in the correct direction.

For example, if I were to sell a $20 PLTR 1/2022 Put I would net nearly \~$500 in premium, if I have the opportunity to purchase 100 shares at $20 I would be thrilled as I have 300 shares of them myself already. It seems like a low risk way to not only gain liquidity but to also have an opportunity to purchase the stock at a set price.

&#x200B;

What are your experiences with selling puts to enter positions? Obviously it could backfire and the stocks could tank. But obviously I am not concerned about the future of the company. The other stock I had in mind was selling a NIO 1/2022 Put as I have 200 shares already and would be interested in adding at a certain cost basis in the low 40s if it was still that price come next January..

&#x200B;

Edit: For specific example, a $22 1/2022 PLTR Call would net you $718 premium. That feels like it is really high considering the odds of the stock being that low are very low themselves..

Just opened a Roth IRA and a taxable account a few months ago for the first time.  

Roth breakdown:  

ICLN 20%
QQQ 21%

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Making weekly investments into the same stocks. Should I auto buy on the same day each week or should I manually try to buy the same dollar amount each week on whichever day dips? I understand a single day dip might not necessarily be considered a dip. I’m new to investing and I can only afford to invest a small amount each week rather than a lump sum. Wondering if I should set a reoccurring investment for the same day each week or try to snipe the most affordable day that week. Obviously it’s unpredictable but right now I invest on Wednesdays and almost every week all my stocks are on an up by the time my buy goes through. Not exactly the same as DCA from my brief understanding. If I set to reoccurring is there a better day of the week on average to buy? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ On RH can I write/sell a call if I don’t have 100 shares but do already own a call on the stock? Hopefully this makes sense and I’m wording it correctly...basically I wanted to see if I already own a call option (which I want to keep) but in the short term want to hedge against can I write a call without having to own 100 shares of the stock?

Basically I believe this would be the same thing as a call credit/debit spread but not buying them at the same time. Also If this is possible do the options have to be for the same expiration date or could I write one the expires sooner?

Any help is appreciated, thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I put my 14k in ARKK ETFs? Hi everyone,

Need some advice. I have about 30k of different stocks I am invested in through E-trade. A Roth IRA that I contribute the max to every year. Along with another 14k account that I have invested with mutual funds through Edward's Jones. I have a checking account, but this 14k is for emergency uses and I only pull out of it when contributing to my Roth if I don't want to pull from my checking. Should I instead split the 14k between ARKK ETF's and take out money from them whenever needed? Would this not be smart because of taxing purposes? I don't know. I feel like it could grow better instead of being in mutual funds. Any advice helps. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICELANDAIR GROUP HF and MAREL HF Hey guys!

$BGS - Beautiful channel going on. Extra strong support area, it may dip lower so be prepared for that. RSI over sold, and Vortex has never been lower. 

&#x200B;

$DRE - Has room to drop to $38 but this 200EMA bounce is strong; and an area of support. Higher lows is a great sign. Stoch is super low and so is Vortex.

&#x200B;

$EBR - Has a tiny bit more room to drop, but 200EMA, support, and channel? Love it. All 3 indicators are oversold, time for a reversal.

&#x200B;

$ED - I mean.... what a channel to play off of. What a great value at $69. Stoch super low, RSI is fair price.

&#x200B;

$KNDI - More risk; I want to see life first. But strong support and channel area to play off of here. All indicators are consolidating.

&#x200B;

$KREF - Fantastic area of value, stochastic divergence, and RSI is over sold. The price action alone is enough to buy in, but the indicators are just icing on the cake.

&#x200B;

$MORF - Resistance retest as a support now, can dip to the 200EMA line still. RSI is fair, and Stoch is super low. May have another day or 2 of selling off.

&#x200B;

$NSA - Fantastic. 200EMA, Support, and a channel altogether here. All 3 indicators are low, this should be a great reversal. 

&#x200B;

$OPTT - Reversing above the area I would like to see, but if it holds go long. Massive potential, more risk than usual. RSI is fair, But Vortex is low and has room to run.

&#x200B;

$PEAK - 200EMA and support are here. Could drop to $28 still. All indicators are oversold, but if it lives we are at the ground floor of a new channel.

&#x200B;

$PEG - Great channel up, this areas has support and trendline. All indicators are low so we should see a reversal soon.

&#x200B;

$WYY - Strong support, strong trend, possible flag here? Massive move possibility. More risk than I like though.
