In my screenshot below for Facebook, I've drawn some trend lines and extended them both left and right on the 180day/4hr time scale. At the time of this post, the oldest date I can see on the 180day/4hr time frame is June 22, 2020. While remaining on the 180day/4hr time frame, how do I "move to the left" (the orange arrow I drew) to see more of the chart? For example, how do I view the graph for June 22, 2019 while still being on the 180day/4hr time frame?

[Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo suffers apparent abort in 1st launch from Spaceport America

(https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-launch-abort-spaceport-america)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Chevron a good buy Hey guys so I recently added chevron to my portfolio at $86 a share. They have the lowest debt to equity out of all oil companies by far as well as low expense and not an insanely high or ratio. And on top of that they pay a 5.7% dividend. I just wanted to get thoughts if whether this was a good or poor decision and why_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About 



When suddenly the BlackBerry and Amazon partnership was announced on December 1st, 2020, most people were shocked (other than those who have been following the story), to learn that BlackBerry “the Phone Company” was still around. Soon they all realized that the phone company from back in the day has now transformed itself into a Software Security Company using AI and Machine Learning. Once a pioneer in smartphone technology, is now pioneering the technology of the future. AI, ML, EV, AV, 5G, WFH, UEM, UES, EPP, MTD, EDR, UEBA, Zero Trust, Zero Touch, Crisis Communications, Cloud etc etc…. After I started writing this article I also wished that it was only a phone company then I would have only had to write about one topic…. It is not the case and let me lay it out.



As you can see from the list above it is not a phone company and it is just not one item that I need to cover. So I will do the best I can, you may search each of these to find out more about them.

BlackBerry - The transformation from a Phone (Hardware) Company to a Software Company


Remember even though BlackBerry has transformed from a hardware company to a software company the technology it developed is still in use today on mobile phones. BlackBerry owns a ton of patents due to being a pioneer in the smartphone business. Some of us don’t realize this but the work email you get on your iPhone, Android Phone, laptop or desktop (Mac or Windows) is secured by BlackBerry…

https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=t.bb&postid=32093887_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cultured Meat Current Opportunites For the last year or two I’ve been interested in the culture (lab-grown) meat industry and have been wanting to invest in some sort of way. 

I’m a newbie to stocks and investments, and understand that the industry has potentially a few years or decades to really take off. With that in mind I’m still down for investing for the long run.

I’ve been trying to do some research on it but all articles/reddit answers are dated 3-5 years ago and all seem to state they are still private companies. I don’t have the money to be doing the private investment route but I did see that other public companies who have invested may be my next option. 

Are there any changes or updates to this situation? Is anyone able to help direct me to where I may research or have my best luck investing? 

Thanks,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to calculate the average return of a group of dividend paying stocks I have a bunch of dividend paying stocks with different position and dividend return sizes. I'm looking to get the average percentage return I am getting for all of my dividends, but am unsure how to do that. Data points I have available: Dividend Percentage, Amount of Stock Owned, Price, Position Size, Payout (either Monthly or Quarterly) and Total Yearly Payout. I have not been able to find the formula needed to put this question into Google Sheets and am wondering if anyone knows it and has it handy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Categorizing the cloud market I am trying to classify the cloud market for DD and comparison.

I have left data storage and computing as these are mostly done by the big cloud players. Data storage has many players other than the big ones like BOX as well. 

I have left out the big cloud players like AMZN, GOOG, MSFT etc as well since they fall into more than one category and cloud is not their main business.

Jumped into some personal investing about $25k a few weeks ago and wondering if I made the right choice with TDA.

- try to hold a stock for at least a year before considering selling.

Current Sell Strategy:

Taking profits;  
If the stock makes 100% gains I sell my principal & leave the rest for 5-10 years (aka to the moon/ground)

Mitigating losses;
If the stock is down 25% or more in the year span I will either sell or keep for another year. If I think the stock is good long-term (5-10 years) I’ll keep it and monitor it.

Risk factor:
- a year out of college
- high risk tolerance
- drawbacks: dealing with the stress of the risks (FOMO, etc...)

Let me know what you all think_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to place a call on ETrade I want like to dip my toes into option trading, but have no idea exactly how to set up a call. I think it is something I really need to do myself in order to really understand how they work. 

If I buy 1 call on Apple, as an example, do I select how much I believe it will go up by a certain date? What if it does goes up but not as much as I thought? What if it surpasses my predicted call? If it drops, how much could I lose with a single call?

I was looking for some advice or what you would personally do if you were in my shoes. I was thinking of buying some Tesla/amazon stocks but I don’t know if it’s too late to profit from that. Thanks for the advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New EV stock $GIK - The company that delivered more commercial electric vehicles in the US than Ford and Daimler combined We have seen about a dozen EV companies this year to go public, but this one is different. Most of this companies like Fisker entirely base their valuation on projected revenue estimates and have not a single unit sold and driving out on the streets.

Lightning eMotors has delivered more commercial electric vehicles this year in the US than [Ford and Daimler combined](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1332377396192837632).

**Lightnings customers are Amazon, DHL, Ikea, Keurig/Dr.Pepper** and many more who buy their electric delivery vans as you can see in the [investor presentation](https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck_vF.pdf). This might not seem like a big deal, but it is. Lightning eMotors actually already does today what many other companies claim to be able to do in a couple years if everything goes by plan. They have many large orders lined up as well and sold over 1,500 units in the last few months alone. Lightning said in October that it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, ramped up production and that it had doubled its workforce.

Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)

This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).

This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).

Don't make the mistake to think that all of these EV companies are garbage because some like NKxx are. This seems to be one of the few like Chargepoint which actually have their shit together.

**The best thing about GIK/Lightning:**

The valuation of Lightning eMotors is just 0.8 billion.

NK\*\* currently trades at 7 billion.

PIC/XLfleet currently trading at 2.4 billion.

Hyliion at 2.7 billion.

CIIC/Arrival at 15 billion.

I posted about SBE/Chargepoint when it was trading at $12 and I was right: [proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyu629/sbe_could_be_the_next_spi_biggest_ev_charging/). This is my next big EV play and I am confident it will work out just as great as my last one did.

GIK already traded at $16 in pre-market but lost a little of its gains on Friday as all EV stocks had a slight sell off. I am confident this will go back to $16 by Monday and might even see $20 next week.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.

# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**
*****
> The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.
*****
> First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there’s a divided view, there’s room for market reaction either way.
*****
> Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.
*****
> Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&P 500 at Friday’s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility — the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.
*****
> “To me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don’t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don’t get one,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “The tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.”
*****
> Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer’s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.
*****
> “I think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,” Hogan said.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.
*****
> “But you can’t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,” he said.
*****
> Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.
*****
> Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.
*****
> “There’s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,” he said. “Both sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.”
*****
> # Tesla revving up the S&P
> Tesla’s entry into the S&P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday’s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .
*****
> “I don’t know if it creates volatility. It’s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. “Given we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn’t take much to see the VIX spike.”
*****
> Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. “It’s just going to create more noise,” he said.
*****
> Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&P.
*****
> Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.
*****
> “What you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,” Bartolini said.
*****
> “It will be exciting. You’re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.
*****
> There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.
*****
> The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.
*****
> “It means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn’t do,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. “That has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.”
*****
> Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.
*****
> # Window on the economy
> There’s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.
*****
> November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.
*****
> Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.
*****
> “I think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it’s pre-vaccine,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.

> # Not All Bad for Small Business

> This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**

> Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.

> As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.

> For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.

> We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.

> Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.

> In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**

> Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.

> Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.

> # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders

> The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.

> At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**

> The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.

> # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish

> For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.

> # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern

> For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.

> Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.

> # Is Inflation Looming?

> The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and “core” readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we’ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.

> “Congress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “but it’s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.”

> As shown in today’s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HEXO I was talking to my friend about our portfolios and he made the suggestion on buying HEXO since it is such a penny stock. I did some of my own research and see they have been running at a loss over the year but given the pandemic it makes sense as to why it has been at a loss for the year. I do not know much about Dispensary companies so what do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking For Book Recommendations Or Free Resources On A Few Stock Subjects. Hi everyone. For a little background I'm 30 years old and just starting to take finances seriously. I'm in no way rich but I want to make my money work for me rather than being paycheck to paycheck my entire life. 

Thankfully, I do have a job and life situation where I have excess money to put away weekly if I dont splurge, I'm trying to save up around 5 to 10k in order to get started and learning in the meantime. 

There are some things I'd really like to learn about related to stocks but I'd like your opinions and trusted resources. I want to learn about different types of strategies in order to have an educated opinion on investing generally. Not in any specific order:

1) Economics in general. I'd like a better understanding of how American and Global economics impact the stock market as well as a better understanding of the economy in general. 

2) Fundamental Analysis. I've read The Intelligent Investor and The Interpretation Of Financial Statements but I'd like to go deeper into evaluating a business if possible. 

3) Technical Analysis: I know this covers a WIDE array of subjects and opinions. I've read a bit of Bollinger but I'd like recommendations on books or resources you feel took your ability to the next level in thus area of technical analysis. 

4) Dividend Investing: Probably not so much a book as just any resources that go over strategies involving making dividend payments work to the fullest. Though a full book would be great I'm not entirely sure if such a thing exists.

In a few days Tesla will be included in the SP500 as we all know. Now there are two people.

On the one hand ppl predict $1000+ on the stock saying that the inclusion boost the price to the moon.

On the other hand ppl predict a drop refering to the history of stocks before they went into a big index.

It  is called the "index effect" and the theory is that a stock performes  very well before getting into the index and underperforming after the  inclusion.

And I am wondering if  it is likely that this will happen since many of the big rating  companies forecast a very low price and they are far more specialised  then I am.

What are your thoughts on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “What a great pair trade... Long Airbnb, short DoorDash.” A conversation with Laurence Tosi (former CFO of Airbnb and Blackstone) about Airbnb, DoorDash and the overall market.

[https://www.newcomer.co/p/airbnbs-ex-cfo-on-airbnbs-ipo](https://www.newcomer.co/p/airbnbs-ex-cfo-on-airbnbs-ipo)  


Here's his analysis of Airbnb vs DoorDash:  


Tosi is much less excited about DoorDash. Right now, investors are betting on Airbnb despite the fact that its business has been hurt by the pandemic. But DoorDash’s business has clearly benefited from the lockdown. Tosi said, “I think the one that could be mispriced here is DoorDash, not Airbnb.”

**Here’s his math**: Airbnb did $4.8 billion in revenue in 2019. DoorDash did $885 million. Airbnb’s revenue is on pace to be $3.36 billion based on the first 9 months of 2020 disclosed in the S-1. DoorDash is on track to generate $2.6 billion. “That's a bubble,” Tosi says about DoorDash’s 2020 revenue. “That's a tremendous amount of growth to come out so quickly.” Airbnb’s market capitalization today is $83 billion. DoorDash’s market cap is $55.6 billion. “If Airbnb is trading at 20-times last year’s revenues and DoorDash is trading 20-times this year’s revenues – Airbnb has tailwinds coming out of the recovery and it might be that DoorDash has headwinds as it comes out of the recovery,” Tosi said. In other words, investors are assuming that Airbnb will grow from a base of pre-pandemic activity and DoorDash will grow from a base of pandemic-level activity. The question is how much DoorDash holds on to its pandemic growth spurt.

I complained that we were only talking about the top-line, itself an indicator that we’ve entered the world of bubblicious thinking. Well, neither of the companies turns a profit, he said. But longer term their earnings profiles are dramatically different. “Airbnb, for sure, is a 35-40% margin business at scale. That's like the best tech companies. DoorDash is going to have margins like Lyft and Uber. I think those are grocery store margins – best year ever a 10 or a 12%.”

I offered my best case for DoorDash relative to Airbnb: DoorDash’s CEO Tony Xu has proven he can out-operate in a tough business. Food is to DoorDash what books are to Amazon, I said.

Tosi took that point in stride, “I do tip my hat to Tony,” Tosi said. “He was a killer operator. He was neck and neck with a bunch of other people – that is pure operational excellence.”

Still, he’s not betting on DoorDash. “What a great pair trade,” Tosi said. “Long Airbnb, short DoorDash.”

So as the tech industry booms away and the bull market for the time being seems to be continuing, what is everyone’s opinion on the resurgence of airline/travel industry for 2021 and when people can travel again? 

Surely the airline industry will pick up again with people flying globally again. Few of the stocks I looked at are; 

UAL - United Airlines Holdings. 
Current Price: $48.36
Price pre-covid: $90+

DAL - Delta Airlines 
Current Price: $41.74
Price pre-covid: $55+ 

AC - Air Canada 
Current Price: $26.16
Price pre-covid: ~$50

AAL - American Airlines Group
Current Price: $17.05
Price pre-covid: ~$25

LUV - Southwest Airlines Co. 
Current Price: $45.88
Price pre-covid: ~$54 

SAVE - Spirit Airlines 
Current Price: $26.23
Price pre-covid: ~$38

Am I the only person thinking that 2021 into 2022 will be booming for the travel industry? Everyone who has missed out on trips, all the young people who go backpacking to figure out who they want to be, all those that couldn’t see family for over a year, with the whole economy picking back up. 

Now some of you may ask if I’m so bullish on the travel industry and airlines in particular, why did I wait til now to consider them? Particularly the uncertainty regarding covid and how long the solution will take. With the vaccine here, we’re still at least 6 months to a year out until normal is a thing, in my opinion, but some of these stocks still have massive upside, no? 

For example UAL, one of the largest airliners in the world. Currently about half the valuation it was pre-covid, surely there must be a 50% upside in the next 1-2 years? Even if there is a 50% upside it would still only be about 75% of its valuation it was pre-covid. I can definitely see some of these companies returning to permanent levels below where they were before, because of the uncertainty and risk of something like covid happening again. 

Am I crazy or are people also bullish? Any discussion would be appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much can we expect PFE to jump? Just want to get some advice. Currently have 15 shares.

Ty_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ELI5 - How can the price for Live Nation, a concert venue and live event promoter, be at or above pre-pandemic levels when revenues are down 95%? Hi everyone. I’m just trying to get some help understanding the macro-economic factors that could lead to this seemingly impossible situation. 

Live Nation is one of the largest live event promoters in the world. They own Ticketmaster and a slew of live event venues across the world. Due to the pandemic, their business has essentially ground to a halt with revenues down over 95% YoY. Despite this, their stock price is currently trading at or above their pre-pandemic levels.

The company has a significant amount of cash on hand at 2.63B with a quarterly burn around 500M. So it is unlikely the company will completely fold unless the pandemic is extended for many years. But still, I don’t understand how the valuation of this company by the market could be so high. Once live events do come back, wouldn’t the company be in a significantly worse financial position than before pandemic because of the huge amount of cash burned? Wouldn’t it make sense for this weaker future position to be priced into the stock now?

Sorry for the potentially dumb question. I’m new to investing and can’t really wrap my head around this one. What do people see in this stock that I am missing?

Please share your experience. Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unpopular opinion had to share Replying to another post I felt I needed to share this with some of you.  It helped put things in perspective for me earlier this year.  As I continue to refine.

1.  If you are buying a stock based on it's fundamentals then holding it for a few weeks or months before selling, you are not an investor, you are trading the stock.  Minimum of a year to even begin calling it an investment....

2.  If you aren't beating the SP500 (at least, preferably the Nas100) as a benchmark, you are NOT a successful trader or investor, and have no business giving advice.  Just because you've made x $ doesn't mean you are a wizard, I think everyone is up on the year unless you are just completely incompetent.  

3.  If one of you stocks did not exists (aka tsla, Nio, etc.) You wouldn't be profitable (so take away all your profits from that one stock and see if you still are still ahead of the benchmark sp500) then you aren't a profitable trader or investor.   

4.  If you aren't tracking your progression and don't actually know the answer to the previous 2 questions.....  Well I just hope you learn something new in the next year when everything calms down again, because you are about to give everything back  chasing the good ol days when you made a grand in 1 day.

Let's say I work a normal day job in the US and have an annual tax burden of tens of thousands of dollars. Let's also say that I'm a pretty conservative investor or that I've had a generally good year and I'm projected to end the year with no capital losses to report.

Since I can write off $3,000 in capital losses against my normal income tax each year, shouldn't I be able to freely allocate $3,000 towards slightly riskier positions and see how they turn out before the end of the year?

From what I currently know, it seems like 2 outcomes are possible:

I’ve also heard brief rebuttals on these. 

My question is what are the short term concerns? It seems with the hype behind this stock and the possibility of uplifting there could be solid profit to take (with obvious risk of people selling or say dilution). But doesn’t it seem worth the risk? I want to hear concerns and bear hypotheses!

I should mention I’ve already purchased shares at 2.80. Not trying to talk people into buying Monday or jumping on ship (though it does help me if you do). Mostly looking to bring me down to earth and risk stratify for selling._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling an Amazon covered call If I buy 100 Amazon shares, I could be selling covered calls every month and making about $21,000 from my calculations. What are your thoughts about it? My worry is that it will fall when Walmart etc. open back up more but then again I feel that more people have become reliant on Amazon as of late. Is this a good strategy? I could also buy Google. Maybe even do a spread if I want to play it safer.

In my Economics class next semester we are playing Howthestockmarket works game and we all have 100k to invest. I'm just wondering what stocks should I choose from? I know that I must diversify my portfolio and in my real portfolio, my biggest gains are from Carvana, Square, Shopify, Abbvie, SPY, and Boeing.   Please, if you have any recommendations let me know or I'd like to know your opinions on any of the stocks I mentioned above ❤️_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If the bubble bursts... After reading through this sub and others discussing the stock market, I imagine many of you are in the same boat as me thinking this gravy train that is the current stock market can’t last forever. I (30m) had a goal of hitting 100k in my retirement accounts by the time I hit 30. Unfortunately, the timing of COVID caused me to just miss my goal by a couple weeks before my 30th birthday when the market took its big dive in March. However, I took that drop as an opportunity to buy and just hit 200k. I know full well that a significant portion of that money (~40-60%) could be lost when the market comes to realize the current state of the world’s economy as a result of the pandemic. But like the path I previously took in March at the start of the pandemic, I’m starting to stock pile money to buy when the correction happens (expecting in roughly 12-18 months). Should you have a stock pile of money when the next correction happens, what sectors and/or stocks are you eager to scoop up? 

I personally approach the market as purely long-term investment opportunity and am not looking for the quick turn and the risk that comes with that. I understand most on here will point to SPY and VOO for the best options or other general index funds for long-term investing; however, I’m wondering what some of your long-term, potential home run swing ideas are. I’m curious on your all’s thoughts regarding those companies that may not be well known enough right now but have the opportunity to change the world should their vision take flight. I’ve personally tried to shape a majority of my investing around companies that are pointed towards the future. 

Looking forward to hearing everyone’s ideas!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FDA grants historic authorization to a Covid-19 vaccine, setting stage for rollout The Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, a seminal moment in the effort to curb a pandemic that has so far infected an estimated 16 million people and killed nearly 300,000 in the United States.
The decision means vaccinations will begin in a matter of days in individuals 16 years of age or older, though the FDA said the vaccine should not be given to individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component. Such reactions were reported once vaccinations began outside of clinical trials in other countries. Initial supplies of the two-dose vaccine are expected to be used primarily in two groups most at risk of getting infected or developing severe disease: health care providers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities.
“While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement.
The vaccine is the first to be authorized in the United States, and has already been authorized in the United Kingdom, Canada, and several other countries. But neither in those countries, nor in the United States, is the vaccine expected to be a panacea for the pandemic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Track ARK trading logs  Hey, guys! I created a project in Github ([https://github.com/Allen1212/trace-ark-trades](https://github.com/Allen1212/trace-ark-trades)) to record all purchases and sales made by ARK Invest from 11/12/2019 to the present and utilize Pine script to visualize these trades in TradingView. It includes trade records of a total of 257 stocks.

Kinda confused and hoping someone can clarify something for me. 

Rolls Royce trades in London under ticker $RR and there is an OTC version in USA with ticker $RYCEY. From my understanding, the OTC is tied to the stock in London, but of course gets traded on its own, so there may be differences in performance based on how those markets trade. But the performance of the two stocks are so different and nearly opposite except on big crash days. 

Can someone help clarify how they work? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Used to like/respect Jim Cramer until recently and here’s why I reversed “Not trying to make friends, just trying to make *you* some money ...”

Before I jump in, I think Cramer does some things really well: entertaining, creating awareness around great companies, calling out WS BS and putting out sensible bull/bear theses. This to me is fully offset by the below:

Cramer has two audiences for simplicity: boomers and us. I have no comment on his boomer “tutelage” and will stick to “millennial, Reddit, RH, whatever’s ...” as he puts it. I mean no actual offense to actual boomer gens; just the term the kids using.

If Cramer really wants to make *you* money he’d say “take the spacs, EVs, and memes to fucking Neptune” since that’s how they trade until he or some twat issues an “in-depth report” stating, in-full, that “Stock X had a great run but at this level, you’d have to be a mentally deranged grandmother of a mentally deranged dipshit to not take profits”

For example, he says on CNBC that CIIC going to $30 is ludicrous and as a result it pulls back by 50%, only to two weeks later dub CIIC “the son of Tesla” and here’s the kicker - knowing full fucking well that we’ll take it overzealously to ATHs - only so that in one week’s time thereafter, “beg you to take profits at these new levels, pretty please.”

And by “beg you to take profits” all he means is “algos, takeover and sell off, leave retail holding the bag, and accumulate over next 2-4wks and then take to ATHs let retail eat shit once again”

I bagheld a couple times because of Cramer and other less-entertaining cucks but wised up and made bank - meaning anticipated his seemingly bi-polar tendencies but more likely his backdoor intentions to make *him and his people* money. 

Many of you have seen this but for others, the proof is in the fucking pudding. YT “Jim Cramer shorting” which features Cramer admitting that he spread misinformation during his hedge fund glory days to enrich himself at the expense of others and get this - how he got kicks off it

Maybe Cramer still doesn’t get boners from shaking down soft-handed retail traders since he now has a fortune from being an entertainer with newfound presidential-level adderral and viagra script but there’s little question that he’s still trying to print AT YOUR EXPENSE based on his incessant flip-flopping that’d make any career politician sleep easier at night_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You think mindgeek will ever go public ?

Consider my losses donations to breast cancer as for now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do I understand put options correctly? From the videos I've watched and the sources I've read, it appears that put options are more of an insurance type Trade.

Let me sum up as I understand it:

"A stock is selling at $100. You think that the stock is going to fall so you place a put order at $75 plus the fee. The stock falls to $50 and you decide to sell. You're still able to sell at $75 as per your options contract."

Now where I don't understand is where the profitability comes in. You own the $75 share and when the stock drops to $50 your  put option saves you from losing $50. Sources I've seen say you're now at a $25 profit for the share, but in the context of your entire portfolio you net zero. Right?

So with the Biden admin coming in most of us assume corporate tax rate will go up. Now with trump's taxes cuts, alot of company growth can be contributed to these cuts among other things.

Thabks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Call Options Profit Can someone explain how you profit from call options I' m not really understanding.

For example, if TSLA has a current market price of 600 and there is a call option with a strike price of 590 and a 10 dollar premium, this essentially makes it break even right? No profit. 

Or is it that as long as the market price ($600 in this case)  is above the strike price ($590 in this case), then it will always be profitable to purchase the call option regardless of the premium price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on Jamie Dimon and 2008 recession This year I have studied a lot on the causes and effects of the housing market crash.
