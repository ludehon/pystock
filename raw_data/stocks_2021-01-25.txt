 Options trading 
Hey everyone first time poster and relatively new to investing . Fair warning I understand the risks associated with option investing and more so asking this question to educate myself .

Was wondering if anyone would be so kind to break down how option trading works .

How do we profit from the sale of an option? (I understand  that it is a right to buy or sell at a certain price but what determines the value of the option ) 

How is it used as a risk reducing strategy ? 

Am I correct in my understanding that at the expiration date we have to honour the terms of the option ? 
-- for instance if I was I had a call option for xyz company to hit x dollars by ______ date and the option expired but the stock never hit the strike price ; do I now have to honour the option and buy the stock at a premium ? 

Appreciate any responses üíØü§ò_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do people think about TTCF? I think that TTCF can be a good investment compared with **beyond meat (BYND). It currently is sitting on** $66,718 million with a liability of 56,550 million. And revenue of 40,962 million up to 9 months in 2020. As of today from the TTCf website "Sam Galletti, Tattooed Chef‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer said, ‚ÄúWe are pleased to streamline our capital structure and enhance our cash position by eliminating the Public Warrants. We have received $124 million of cash from warrant exercises to date, and now our cash balance is well over $200 million."

**$33.9bn is the market value for what they are currently selling in such as frozen foods.**

A good resource is the Analyst day presentation on the 15 of December 2020.

But what really is getting me into water is the volume increase in water futures, and I think it might be the new hot commodity towards the end of this decade.

The World Wildlife Fund estimates by 2025, 2/3 of the world's population may face a water shortage.

A water shortage goes hand in hand with a food shortage as well.

I know renewables and short squeezes are the hot topics right now . But I feel we take water for granted and it is being overlooked. And water can be a great long-term investment. How great? That will be is determined by if and by how will the USA be affected by a water shortage. But we are already seeing how droughts are affecting California's water supply.

I think bulk of the money to be made in this sector will be from purifying water and transporting water.

I think within 10 years, water stocks will be like EV and renewables stocks are now.

Anyways, here are my favorites, from most favorite to least favorite.

# Danaher Corp ($DHR)

Absolutely huge and diverse company with a lot of resources. Their environmental solutions division is where their water businesses are at.

This is an overall safe bet. And I think if there is a drinking water shortage, Danaher's technology to diagnose and treat water will be beneficial worldwide.

# Evoqua Water Technologies ($AQUA)

They specialize in technologies that remove chemicals from water. They do so much, it's hard to give the cliffnotes. Better off going on their website.

# Taiwan Semiconductors ($TSM)

Not a pure water play. But $TSM might benefit from a water shortage. Since water is already scarce in Taiwan, they created advanced practices that recapture and re-filter water multiple times. I'm not sure if they can sell this technology/equipment to other semiconductor or tech companies. But what might happen is while other companies are blindsided by a water shortage and can't mass produce their chips like they used to, they might outsource to TSM.

# Xylem ($XYL)

Xylem has "SmartBall" technology that is used to find non-revenue water (water that is lost from leaks, unauthorized use, inefficiencies). For example, this was the technology used in Africa to investigate problems with their water pipes, which impacted Rand Water (largest water utility in Africa).

# Advanced Drainage Systems ($WMS)

They basically do the pipes. It has already seen a huge run up this last year though. And they are mostly focused on moving/directing water (sewage, rainwater, etc.).

# American Water Works ($AWK)

This seems like the obvious choice, but I put this one last because a large portion of their business is being a utility. Utilities are already heavily regulated by the government. I can't imagine them making more profits if water is scarce in the USA. And they are currently only in 16 states, so it's not a global play.

&#x200B;

There's a bunch of desalination (turn salt water to fresh water) companies out there as well. $CWCO looks interesting, but they have a bad habit of closing out deals.

Another area to explore would be water transportation. Water is actually expensive to transport. I will have to do more research on this. But if you have any names here, let us know.

I'm not sure any huge companies like Pepsi and Coke have water rights that would give them a 1 up on other companies if there is a water shortage. If things get so bad, we might rely on these companies for bottled water.

Right now, I am only in $DHR and $TSM (though I didn't get in this one for the play on water). I might explore buying $AQUA._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biden pumping $AMER Made in America ETF Anybody watch Bidens briefing on manufacturing and Infrastructure, specifically mentioned American Steel and a "made in America initiative", I bought $STLD Steel Dynamics, and $AMER Made in America ETF before close, I'm also holding a lot of battery tech, EV, and sustainable energy.

GAMING: In addition, they just acquired Yo Yo gaming, which is one of the top 2D gaming design softwares out there. They are making moves in the gaming industry which we all know is booming, especially in developing areas like Africa/SE asia.

ADVERTISING: They also have Opera News, which is one of the biggest content providers for Africa in delivering news and advertisements on their mobile platform.

EARNINGS PLAY: Feb 25th is earnings, they are expected to exceed their expectations and will provide guidance for 2021, which i expect to be ++ positive

TLDR; $OPRA  is much more than a browser company that it used to be, it is a tech company well diversified in gaming, advertising, fintech and targeting rapid growth areas in Africa and SE Asia and it is profitable already.

This is a much safer play than $JMIA with their shady past imo.

Mkt Cap: Only 1.16bn, leaving much room for exponential growth.

Since AMWL‚Äôs IPO in September 2020, where it issued a total of 41.2 million shares and raised $742 million, the stock has risen to $32 from the debut price of just $18, an increase of about 77% in 5 months. Amwell has positioned itself as a leading performer in the healthcare industry, having quickly become one of the biggest players in telehealth. It connects healthcare providers, including mental health practitioners, to patients over secure video - giving people access to healthcare from virtually anywhere. For obvious reasons, this has been especially necessary in 2020. Despite a recent IPO, the company already has a market cap of about $6.53 billion.

AMWL was founded in 2006 and has grown exponentially over the last 15 years. Though the pandemic definitely gave it a large boost, it‚Äôs not going anywhere once it's over. It seems like the pandemic was the final push for healthcare providers who were holding out on telehealth to finally get it on the action; it was no longer an option for them. Widespread vaccination won't eliminate the necessity for telehealth as a service--much less the demand. Many people are now treating telemedicine as their first choice care option. In fact, in a recent survey, 62% of telehealth patients said they‚Äôd continue to have virtual visits with their mental health providers once the pandemic ends. The company is expanding at a significant rate since the start of the pandemic and is quickly expanding its services, growing its network of doctors and working with more insurance companies. 

For the more technical folks who like to see hard numbers: AMWL has a YoY revenue growth of 80% to $62.6 million and had total doctor visits of more than 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 450% compared to the same time in 2019.

Google invested $100 million into AMWL. To me this is not only a strong indicator of viability, it's a virtual guarantee that they will have the resources necessary to execute on their growth strategy.

Compared to last year, the total number of providers increased 930% percent from just 6,000 to 62,000 - allowing more patients to receive care while increasing specialties provided; as the network expands, the value of the network grows.

$AMWL reported revenue of $114 million in 2018 and $149 million in 2019, an increase of about 31%. The company projects revenue to be between $235 million and $239 million for 2020 (I will try to remember to update this once these numbers are announced). 

In addition to a major partnership with Cleveland Clinic, AMWL recently announced the introduction of 3 brand new products designed to reach a bigger audience: Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software and C500.

It's clear that AMWL is growing at an incredible pace as evident by the YoY revenue, network size, and patient growth in the past 1-2 years and will continue to grow into the foreseeable future. As the company‚Äôs provider network and insurance company network continues to grow, so does its efficiency at attracting new patients in a broader range.

TDLR; AMWL: Good company to invest in, great future prospects, incredible revenue, patient, and healthcare provider network growth, as well as substantial new product offerings and joint ventures.

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thryv ($THRY) A VERY Undervalued and Growing SaaS business. Hey all, wanted to post a stock idea that I really like: THRY. 

The basic story is that it is 2 businesses, with only one being valued by the market. It is a growing SaaS business, kind of like Hubspot (HUBS) called Thyrv- it has about 1/2 the customers of HUBS, and while the businesses are a little different- they do very similar things. HUBS does software for businesses (lots of enterprise) whereas THRY does so for small businesses. 

I have some experience with the software, and I think that it has a really good setup that will benefit lots of small businesses. Seems VERY undervalued.

the other part of the business is the yellow pages. It's a declining revenue one BUT it is cash flowing like crazy- and the company was able to get customers from the YP business, over to the SaaS business. They are also in the process of acquiring another YP style business to juice for cash flow, and get customers off of. It seems to me like the market is valuing the YP business, and not assigning much, if anything to the SaaS business. Especially for the growth that is coming up.

The company has lots of presentations to look at, that explain the thesis better than I ever could. 

here is the most recent: https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/register.aspx?conf=needham103&page=thry&url=https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/thry/2287146

Bagholders that have been looking for an exit for years may start to sell. I know my brother did yesterday. Institutional and value oriented investors look at this significant jump, see the $$ and jump ship...

Additionally, their performance really isn't that great, sure they are transitioning, but that transition has already taken place years ago, phones haven't been a large part of their revenue for atleast 3 years. 

Their EPS is down 282% Q/Q, with sales down 18.4% Q/Q. If Apple and Amazon start working with Blackberry, sales could increase? But who knows how much? Certainly competition will emerge. Microsoft has already partnered with GM on their self driving platform.  Who knows, Tesla or Nio may sell their software. Elon likes making patents available to the public...

I hear a lot of people saying BB is criminally undervalued, even after the jump. I'm just not that sure.

Disclosure: Jan 29, 13c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Medmen $MMNFF .. Huge upside potential 
Medmen $MMNFF ... huge upside potential

I have accumulated shares in Medmen for the following reasons:

- New management team with turn-around expertise and banker backgrounds including m+a (opens door for possible takeover)

- Last quarter was first positive cash flow quarter in history. Successful cost cutting overhaul from previous managements failures. 

- Strong backing by Gotham Green. So far, when money is needed-  they have continued to be a partner that medmen can lean on. 

- Potential cannabis legalization in NY should help revenues a lot. Governor Cuomo has hinted at this.

-  Potential passing of federal banking bill which should allow more institutional ownership of cannabis stocks especially those not on US exchanges. The blue shift in house senate and presidency may make this happen sooner than later.

- On their last investor call they mentioned a potential partnership with the atlanta hawks. Which can only help their brand.

- Many people have given up on medmen and it felt like many had dumped shares in december likely for tax loss reasons. It feels like anyone who has wanted out of the stock has done so at this point and i feel the potential growth and turn around story is not yet at all appreciated by the market. 

- Despite the markets opinion , medmen still seems like a premier brand that can be a potential acquisition target 

- This is a new year, with new catalysts , and new potential buyers and I feel medmen has a lot of catching up to do with the cannabis space. I think the current stock price  is a bargain with a potential large return for shareholders if they successfully execute their plans.

Disclosure- I own the stock. If the stock rises to the point at which I feel the value has been unlocked i may sell the stock. The stock carries risk, there is a large debt load which can be dilutive, and they can even risk bankruptcy. However, they did recently secure debt from Gotham green in the form of warrants at$.16 which i believe wont hit (dilute) the market until the 5 year lockup expires. 

More information about recent debt raise here - https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005717/en/MedMen-Announces-Additional-US10-Million-Senior-Secured-Convertible-Note-Financing-Under-Gotham-Green-Facility_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investors: So you bought BBBY after my last post, how do we deal with it today? A few weeks ago I made a post about my case for BBBY as a long-term investment.  I made note of some impressive changes BBBY has made over the past year to cut down on waste and increase their presence in e-commerce.  Most notably, I expressed great interest in their leadership team, bringing in prior execs. and management from various big shot consumer/commerce brands.  They characterized their opportunity in BBBY as "a startup company with fortune 500 financials."

Back then I said BBBY was worth 2-3% of my portfolio pre-earnings, and I said I was willing to DCA down to 4-5% post-earnings.  Well, clearly, I did not have to DCA down.  BBBY has already doubled since my last post.  Althought, I will say that as a long-term investor this raises some flags... So... what now?

**I still believe in the growth of BBBY long-term.  However, there is nothing wrong with taking some profits.**  I did not expect BBBY to grow 2x within a few weeks.  It looks like we are getting away from the valuations and potential of the company, which makes me uncertain in the short-term.  A great rule to follow as long-term investors is to not to dabble in things that start to fall beyond your comprehension.  This not only applies to your knowledge of certain industries but also your knowledge of how the stock price is moving.  I have no idea how the options world works, and I have no idea how to play around "short squeezes" and all that stuff. 

**What am I doing today?**  Since I am at 2X+ my initial investment, I set a stop loss at that mark.  That way, at the very worst, I get my initial investment back and what's left of my position is "free money."  I can consider re-entering once things calm down.  I don't want to sell right away because I still believe in the growth of BBBY long-term--I just don't think the price meets where the company's value is at, currently.

If these are indeed hot, should I consider these ETFs instead? The rationale here is to go for a more "diversified" investment, so that even if these stocks underperform in 2021, I can capitalize on the general market trends that they represent.

Shares of the video game company soared more than 50% to $101.01 at its high of the session shortly after the open. The stock was last up 35% to $87.80 when it was halted for volatility.

‚ÄúThe sudden, sharp surge in GameStop‚Äôs share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze, given the high short interest, and, to a lesser degree, speculation by retail investors on forecasts for the new gaming cycle and the involvement of activist RC Ventures,‚Äù Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said in the note on Monday.

GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer, has been a popular short target on Wall Street. In fact, more than 138% of its float shares had been borrowed and sold short, the single most shorted name in the U.S. stock market, according to FactSet citing the latest filings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO also heavy shorted and with space to grow FUBO is also a heavily shorted stock with lot of space to gain until $60, the maxs of december.

I didn't invest a penny into GME, and that's simply because it's fundamentals are broken. Yes, it was undervalued, but at today's $100 it trades astronomically high and should be avoided (posting here instead of WSB who are a bunch of self-proclaimed dummies).

Palantir is the Google of the next 10 years. As we speak, Palantir's data platform is being deployed to solve Coronavirus and other problems that require real time data and insights much faster. Google does not have these capabilities to the scale and use that Palantir is developing. While their data harvesting may lead to some negative implications, this is no different than most other ethical dilemmas facing other large firms (Facebook, Google, Amazon). The advantage Palantir has is being entirely data focused - they don't sell phones, their business is entirely in the cloud. The other advantage is long term contacts - Palantir does deals in the multi million or billion range over several years. When you sign clients at that range, you grow such loyalty and use that it is unlikely that a company would churn (not sign on again).

This isn't a short term play or squeeze or whatever - hold this one for at least a year, if not five. It is the kind of stock you build an estate around, and at a price that is criminally low (due to a direct listing). There are few companies that will build the data moat and intelligence this company will provide, and they could become the de-facto operating system of the US government (and others around the world).

Wall Street has allowed illegal activities from large hedge funds and wall street MM's for years. Many are calling this out on GME - and I applaud!

" Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock, or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short. Due to various loopholes in the rules, and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems, naked shorting continues to happen.

These short sales are almost always done only by options [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) because they allegedly need to do so in order to maintain [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) in the options markets. However, these options market makers are often brokers or large [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp)¬†who abuse the options market maker exemption."

I do not know how the GME saga will end. Perhaps the most fitting end would be for the Gamma Squeeze to continue this week and GME bail out the shorts by issuing a ton of shares at around $250. This would then fully fund their on-line cloud-based gaming empire!

Now for WKHS. The play is the same - heavily short stock, lowish market cap, weekly options with good volumes, and a future story that many dought - the EV revolution. These same short firms, climate deny funded firms(big oil, etc), attacked TSLA last year - that did not work so well!

So now some have moved on from TSLA, and are attacking other EV firms like WKHS. Currently, WKHS has a 30% short position - not huge, but high. The play? Buy the stock, and buy the OTM calls. WKHS build electric vans, trucks, etc for commercial work - hense the workhorse name. With a Joe Biden win and control of congress - I expect a lot of EV funding over the next year.

One big catalyst will be the bid for the $8.1 billion USPS contract award decision that has been delayed beyond the US Presidential Election date. With Biden now in Charge - I expect a larger $$ for USPS, and WKHS will get a % of this deal IMHO.

**Waitr Holdings inc - WTRH**

*Market cap: $*375 million

*Current price:* $3.3

*Price target: median $6 with a high estimate of $8 (CNN)*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background information**

Waitr is an online food ordering platform started in Louisiana, providing delivery, carryout and dine-in options. Waitr, along with Bite Squad connect local restaurants and grocery stores to diners in underserved U.S. markets. Together they are a convenient way to discover, order and receive great food from local restaurants, national chains and grocery stores. As of September 30, 2020, Waitr and Bite Squad operated in small and medium-sized markets in the United States in over 700 cities

**Companies Financials**

* Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $52.7 million, compared to $49.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 7%.
* Net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $4.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $220.1 million, or a loss of $2.89 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019.
* Adjusted EBITDA1 for the third quarter of 2020 was $13.0 million, compared to a loss of $15.4 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $28.4 million.
* As of October 31, 2020, cash on hand was approximately $80 million.
* The Company completed its at-the-market common equity offering program on July 10, 2020, issuing an aggregate of 23,698,720 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $47.6 million during the period of March 20, 2020 through July 10, 2020.
* On August 3, 2020, the Company prepaid $10.5 million to its lender in exchange for a rate decrease of 200 basis points for 1 year along with a one-year extension of the maturity date to November 15, 2023 on both its credit facility and convertible notes.

2020 was a great year for them, it's their second consecutive quarter of continued profitability and operating cashflow --> result of fundamental strategic initiatives such as cutting costs, doubling assets and cutting liabilities.

**Why not invest in its competitors with bigger name such as DASH or UBER**

With 2 million active users, Waitr has diversified its product offering beyond food delivery, having recently introduced its tableside service technology. Combining this ‚Äúdine-in‚Äù offering with its existing delivery and take-out ordering services, Waitr now offers an integrated payment solution that can help restaurants improve their safety protocols, sales and efficiency, both inside and outside the four walls of the restaurant.

It should also be said how Waitr has been profitable even **before** Covid-19. Companies such as DASH and UBER just started making money thanks to the lockdown as restaurants started relying more on delivery services as well as an increased demand for food delivery.

Waitr is gaining traction, with a dominated market in Louisiana and most south east states, Waitr now focuses to expand in smaller cities and suburbs as the "big players" have already marked their turf in the large cities and urban areas.

**Stock prediction (TA)**

r/stocks *does not allow pictures :(*

Waitr has been in the $4 - $3 range for some months now. A catalyst would be needed to break through the $4 barrier. Thankfully, there are two:

1. Earnings on March 15, 2021. Rapid growth suggests expectations will be met and estimates will be exceeded. Expect less cash on hand ($80 million Oct 31, 2020)
2. Short interest. Now this ones the good one gentlemen (and ladies ?), Waitr price has suffered due to shooters and inside trading (CEO Carl Grimstad excised his right to buy \~2,000,000 January 4 @ 2.70) . Current short volume is about 15,070,000 out of 20,490,000 shares giving us a short percentage float of 73.55%!

A break through the 4$ range after Q4 2020 earnings released in March can lead to shorts covering their positions, increasing price again, and again, and again, and again. Think about it! Price prediction of $6 was not realistic, (for those of you that actually read this DD, my personal price prediction is $15 EOY). 

This play might turn out like GME (lower scale of course). Now, take those words with caution, this is not a pump and dump scheme like some of you think GME is. This is a value play, we are just getting lucky with a ridiculous number of shorts ;).

**Risks** 

Now I may not know much about DD's, but I know I must include some risks.

* CEO Carl Grimstad might sound like a good guy (on paper) but investors don't like him. No publicity, events news etc. People say he was brought in (January 2019) to get in negotiations with a large potential acquirer, but no changes have been made. --> If a company acquires Waitr, Stock will be valued at \~7 per share
* There's a chance short sellers keep benefitting and drive the stock down, would be possible if we are presented with poor Q4 results.
* The big boys in town (UBER DASH) advance faster than WTRH and take over their terrain... not much evidence on this one but worth mentioning, WTRH is still a small cap stock.

**Conclusion**

I had fun writing this, don't know if it all makes sense or if my claims are backed up well enough but let me know in the comments.

Remember, do your own research first and don't just throw money onto a stock because people hype it up and put rocket ship emojis.

Been investing for 3 years now, every penny I can into funds for 10 years. 

Swayed from funds slightly around May and got super lucky with 50% of my portfolio on a certain stock before a split, which made me think I was leonardo di caprio in that trading film I can‚Äôt mention  incase post gets flagged! Jumped on a meme stock, lost 40% of my overall profits in a day! I absolutely know I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm still in the green and thought I‚Äôd learned my lesson. 

That is until last week where you-know-what stock is blowing up... I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm getting massive FOMO and apparently I‚Äôm not content on 40% loss on profits...

I‚Äôve just this morning on a white board, written out the same projections I made 3 years ago, ‚Äúif I save ¬£x amount every month and use 7% as my average interest). And I was more than happy with the results over 10 years. I think I‚Äôll create a more permanent board somewhere with my estimated numbers year on year compared to the actual numbers, to remind myself I‚Äôm on track. 

Sure more money would be good, but it‚Äôs not worth the FOMO. I will have as much as I need sticking to my funds and I can‚Äôt really ask for more than that!

TL;DR
Combat FOMO by reminding yourself why you got into investing, crunch the numbers and see you‚Äôll more than likely still be on track regardless of others profits!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PERI (Perion Network) DD - The next MGNI, PUBM, TTD Good day gents, let me bring your attention to $PERI.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel‚Äôs drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday‚Äôs close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday‚Äôs close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It‚Äôs expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I‚Äôve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla‚Äôs models. It‚Äôs the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way‚Ä¶ [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron‚Äôs Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don‚Äôt think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the possibility of the pullback‚Ä¶ keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005282/en/Arcimoto-to-Acquire-Tilting-Motor-Works_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on Lucid merger? Hey guys,

I was planning on buying Lucid with all the rumors of a merger happening. However, I feel like its too late bc the price is high at the moment, and even though a merger happens and prices soar, I still feel it is risky because it is all based on rumors. 

Saying all that, I may buy if prices drop, though I highly doubt they will.

Also, long term, I‚Äôm not sure how well Lucid will do in the market. Prices may soar, but I don‚Äôt think they will match Tesla, or even NIO. Their cars are $160k+, and although there may be a market for these kinds of EV luxury vehicles with the richer class, my thinking is why would you want to buy a Lucid car with that kind of money if you could buy another high end brand name car? (Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Lambourghini etc.) And what if these high end dealers come out with EVs of their own?

> Many Tesla fans view the electric carmaker as a world leader in self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk himself has repeatedly claimed that the company is less than two years away from perfecting fully self-driving technology.

> But in an interview with Germany's Manager magazine, Waymo CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla as a Waymo competitor and argued that Tesla's current strategy was unlikely to ever produce a fully self-driving system.

> "For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all," Krafcik said. "We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system."

> For Musk, these two technologies exist along a continuum. His plan is to gradually make Tesla's Autopilot software better until it's good enough to work with no human supervision. But Krafcik argues that's not realistic.

> "It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system," Krafcik said. "In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers."

> This isn't a new argument.

> **Tesla keeps missing Musk's predictions**

> Tesla has a lot riding on its efforts to develop fully self-driving technology. Since 2016, Tesla has been selling cars with a suite of cameras, radar, and other hardware that it has touted as ready for full self-driving with a future software update. The same year, Tesla started charging thousands of dollars for a "full self-driving" software package that was supposed to be delivered later.

> If Tesla can't deliver fully autonomous software, it's going to have a lot of angry customers. Musk initially predicted that this technology would be ready by 2018, but he's repeatedly pushed back the timeline.

> Last October, Tesla finally released a beta version of its "full self-driving" software to a selected group of Tesla customers. Where earlier versions were limited to certain driving environments‚Äîprimarily highways‚Äîthe FSD beta was designed to handle most common road and intersection types. It could stop for stop lights, make left turns, and navigate roundabouts.

> But the software was clearly not ready for wide release. I watched a few hours of early unedited footage posted by Tesla owners who received the new software. The software made a number of mistakes, including two incidents where a Tesla seemed to be on the verge of colliding with another vehicle before the driver intervened.

> Tesla, of course, is working to fix these issues and improve the software over time. Musk believes that before too long, the software will be good enough that it can operate without active human oversight. And not long after that, it will be good enough to operate completely autonomously‚Äîwith no one in the driver's seat or even in the car at all.

> **Waymo rejected Tesla's strategy years ago**

> But Waymo's leaders have long doubted that premise. They believe that lidar sensors will be indispensable to get early self-driving vehicles on the road. They also believe that the transition from a driver-assistance system to a fully driverless system is fraught with danger.

> The Waymo team believes its own early experience‚Äîwhen it was the Google self-driving car project‚Äîbears that out. In the early 2010s, Google developed a driver-assistance system similar to today's Autopilot and considered selling it to automakers. But when they let Google employees test the software on public roads, they found that drivers came to trust it way too quickly. Drivers who were supposed to be closely monitoring the system instead spent their time looking at their phones, putting on makeup, and other distractions.

> The fundamental challenge here is that the better a driver-assistance system gets, the harder it is to get drivers to pay attention, and the less likely they are to be prepared if the software makes a mistake. The Google team didn't see a good solution to this problem, so they completely changed their strategy. They focused on building a self-driving taxi service that would never have customers in the driver's seat, relying on trained, professional safety drivers to oversee the software during testing.

> Krafcik says that Waymo has largely completed technical work on its self-driving software and is now focused on scaling the technology up. If that's true, the company may be able to demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of its approach in the next couple of years. Musk has dismissed Waymo's approach as a "highly specialized solution" and questioned whether Waymo can scale it up.

> Meanwhile, despite the repeated failures of his past predictions, Musk continues to insist that Tesla's full self-driving technology is close to release. "I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base" in 2021, Musk stated last month. Krafcik, meanwhile, believes Tesla's approach is a dead end.

Anecdotally, I‚Äôve noticed when a stock has an insane run up until earnings, any good news (or especially lackluster news) has already been baked into the price (think: Tesla battery day). When a stock doesn‚Äôt run up until the earnings it takes just a little positive news to move it up (Netflix last week). 

AAPL had an insane run up last week. I sold covered calls at 138 and aapl is 140 right now. I‚Äôve never seen AAPL move this much in a week. I hold a leap as my underlying so I will continue to lose (1-delta of long) for for every additional dollar it goes over the sold calls. I‚Äôll probably hold until the end of the week to see what happens but curious: 

Does anyone have any data showing what happens to companies during earnings when they‚Äôve had run-ups prior to them? Conversely, when they were stagnant up until earnings and the company announced they beat earnings?

So I was thinking about stocks and youtube videos and wall street bets. Are YouTubers and wall street bets causing artificial price inflation, because they are all recommending certain stocks and with big enough audiences they can act like institutions and raise the prices of stocks even though there is no reason for their price to get that high? The Youtuber and people who recommending these stocks will then profit with less risk because the stocks they are already holding with raise in price because they recommend it on their youtube channels and if it keeps happening it will cause a bubble and the companies eventually won't have anything to show for the price being that high and the people who know this will get out before it pops and make bank while screwing thousands of traders in the process? In the end, the stocks they say do raise, but that is because everybody watching or in-wall street bets will buy it?

Very new stocks but from what I can see there seems to be significantly less risk buying in the money options with relatively the same reward. Ill use BB as an example here.

The % increase to break even on a call is so much lower vs a out of the money call. I ran some calculations on the profit vs the two, and it just doesn't seem worth it. Am I missing something here ?

Let‚Äôs say I have $100 in my account. There‚Äôs a stock at $10 that I think is going up, so I buy a call option with a $15 strike price (for some time frame, that‚Äôs not really important). The premium is $1 each, so I spend $100 total for the 100 shares in the contract. I now have $0 in my account. 

First question: the most I can lose is the $100 I spent on the premiums, correct? I‚Äôve heard stuff about options having lots or even unlimited risk, but in this situation with call options I‚Äôm only risking the initial $100, right?

Second question: say the stock‚Äôs price increases to $20. I now have a profit of $5 per share, minus premiums. I have the right to buy each share at $15 and sell at $20. However, do I need more money in my account to execute this trade, since I currently have no money in my account? Or is it possible to execute the $15 buy and $20 sell simultaneously so that I don‚Äôt need the $1500 in my account that I would need to buy the shares outright at $15? Or is there a way to sell the option itself without having to manually buy and then sell the underlying stock? (Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm on a certain zero commission brokerage for this example)

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Peace!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about deep In The Money options I understand what options are and how they work in general, but I'm a bit confused about the pricing of something I'm seeing.

There is a stock whose share price is currently around $15. I can see some call options with a strike price of $5 ($10 profit per share if exercised now) being sold for $9. Does that mean if I buy a contract of that for $900 and immediately exercise those options, I can spend $500 (for a total cost of $1400) to buy 100 shares of that stock which is actually worth $1500??

Thanks a lot_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tellurian $Tell DD Long Term Outlook and Value Proposition Below is a recap of why I believe whole-heartedly in Tellurian and the potential growth in this company. As full disclosure and being transparent,  I currently hold 117k shares and calls Jan 22 $3, $5, $10, $15 sprinkled in. I began buying Tell at the COVID crash in the .70s. I've wheeled options while rolling money into shares as I've gone. It's been an emotional roller coaster (especially October dips) In one year I started with 60k YOLO and now I'm at 417k at Friday's close. Even with the recent growth in the last 30 days, this is just the beginning for Tell. I'm holding for the long term at least until 2024 when Phase 1 construction is completed.

I could make this post a college essay, but I'll aim to keep it short and to the point.

**Who is Tellurian?**

Tellurian is an LNG (liquid natural gas) provider/exporter that will be a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for sourcing, a pipeline for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic HH prices as they'll be selling on JKM.

Driftwood has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision.

Link to Tell's latest presentation: [https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation\_tellurian\_january-2021\_final/](https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation_tellurian_january-2021_final/)

The Management team is comprised of heavy hitters and LNG legends including the LNG godfather Charif Souki who was the founder of Cheniere Energy.  If they can do it once, they can do it again.

**LNG**

Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to "cleaner renewable" sources. Green Energy is forecasted to be 74% of energy generation. For renewables, Solar/Wind is forecasted at 10%-15% of the renewable sources with Bio Mass as 70%-80%. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shutdown during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again.  Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

LNG will be the source for heat/cooling as it will be used for power generation including all those EVs and Tesla's that need to charge from the grid.

**Price Targets**

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I came up with a simple method to balance risky and safe investments as a long term investor and to ensure ending the year green This method works by calculating the risk tolerance and deciding how much money you‚Äôre going to invest safely vs take risks with. However it requires the discipline to cut losses after exceeding the risk tolerance.

The first step is to ask yourself ‚Äùhow much am I willing to lose at the end of the year?‚Äù

Now pick some safe stocks that you believe will grow by a guaranteed amount if nothing bad happens and calculate their average expected growth for the year.

For example:

The FAANG rose up nearly 50% last year and for the sake of this example let‚Äôs expect it to do as well this year too.

Let‚Äôs say your risk tolerance percentage is 20% of your $10k portfolio for the year ($2k).

Now to safely end the year with at least a 0% loss margin, you would to have to invest $4k into the FAANG ($4k * 50% = $2k profit).

That would leave you with $6k to invest in other stocks and of that $6k you are allowed to lose $2k and still manage to end the year at 0% or possibly green thanks to the reliable FAANG returning your losses.

Obviously you would have to be very certain about the minimum expected growth of the ‚Äùsafe stocks‚Äù to base your risk tolerance on them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ question about the bubble fears So many people are saying that we are in a bubble and are due for a huge correction.

CEO has major connections in Washington having previously served as the Deputy Secretary of Energy prior to his current role.

Newest product is HALEU (High-assay low enriched uranium) - necessary for newer advanced reactor designs.¬†

One such design is used by TerraPower, the Gates-backed nuclear energy firm. In September, the company announced a partnership with Centrus Energy to supply HALEU in order to ensure domestic supply.

Under contract with the US Department of Energy, Centrus Energy is building the only US facility that will be licensed to produce HALEU.

With Joe Biden elected and a blue wave, more investment into clean energy is highly likely. One can imagine that Bill Gates himself will have many ears following his warnings about preparing for a pandemic, however he is even more vocal about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. His book ‚ÄúHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster‚Äù will be released in February and will no doubt talk about Nuclear energy being a key factor given his stance on the issue through his various media appearances (and private investments).

Nuclear energy has many tailwinds but $LEU is a lower-risk (and high upside) way to gain exposure given its government contracts and partnerships given their deep pockets. The thesis is long-term given plants are being built now to prove the concept, but the way markets anticipate, there will be a lot of enthusiasm for these companies in the near future.

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week so the watchlist this week will be shortened. It's¬†earnings week so most plays will be high reward with higher risk. A lot of stocks on my radar are also quite over-extended it was difficult to find some perfect setups this week. I'll post my current positions at the bottom of the post. Only two positions currently down and the rest are in the green. As it gets closer to expiration they will be more volatile with reactions to the stock price. I might close out COTY this week. It hasn't been my favorite play and fortunately my covered call has off-set almost all of the stock price going down about 8%.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my "watchlist". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares.

**SNAP ($54) - Earnings Feb 03**

[SNAP chart](https://imgur.com/I7LpsWL)

SNAP earnings coming up in 2 weeks. Last quarter the stock pumped 30% after a blowout quarter. IV will be VERY high for this earnings coming up. Looking at the chart it looks like it's been consolidating for a few weeks. It's just kissing the current support/resistance level it's trading at, but still in a healthy spot on the upward channel. I think I will look to sell at the $50 and get some good premium there.

**Positions on the watchlist**

Feb 12, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $3.15 or $315 premium. 

Return: 6.3%.

Break-even share price: $46.85

**PSTH ($29)**

[PSTH chart](https://imgur.com/oZLaOCv)

Everyone loves PSTH thinking Ackman going to bring something big and soon. Shares seem to be on that steady grind up without many pullbacks. We are at a slight pullback and decent entry point IMO to sell some puts. Even selling $28 PUT might provide enough premium and a cushion should the stock actually pullback soon. Otherwise there is lots of hype surrounding this stock and Bill Ackman knows how to play the game. Not many strikes available on this play I will sell the $30 put. You may notice that it is already in-the-money, which is ok because I will receive enough premium to make my break-even share price, and cost basis should I be assigned, at around $27. Stock currently trading at $29.20

**Positions on the watchlist**

Feb 19, 2021 $30 strike puts sold to open for $2.75 or $275 premium. 

Return: 9%.

Break-even share price: $27.15 << this is my cost basis should things go against me

**CRON ($10.65)**

[CRON chart](https://imgur.com/N19xK9B)

A lot of people were sleeping on Cronos at the end of the year last year. The stock price has since doubled! This one is a bit of a lotto play for me since the chart has no real trend or support/resistance after this huge move. They report earnings 2nd or 3rd week of February I believe, this is NOT confirmed yet. You can see the gap up it had last earnings and how volatile this stock is. I might try and sell puts at the $10 level and collect premium there. I will be looking to close this PRE-EARNINGS if I can collect some of that premium.

**Positions on the watchlist**

Feb 19, 2021 $10 strike puts sold to open for $0.45 or $45 premium. 

Return: 4.5%.

Break-even share price: $9.55

**INTRODUCTION**

On social media, this disruptor company has been called the Robinhood of fintech. Its customer base is the little guy: small and medium enterprises the world over.  How?

> Otherwise you‚Äôd have to contact multiple parties and in the end they wouldn‚Äôt bother doing business with you, cause you‚Äôre too small of a fish.

Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won‚Äôt in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.  [This total addressable market is only expected to grow to $2.5 trillion by 2025.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/exporters-mind-trade-finance-gap/)

Better yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived. [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]

**TRADE FINANCE INDUSTRY**

Trade finance was [described in The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/07/04/trade-finance-stumbles-into-the-digital-era) as "the world's most complicated paper chase":

> Take operational troubles first. Trade finance is notoriously paper-based. Processing credit requires involved parties, from financiers and carriers to warehouse managers and customs officers, to exchange an average of 36 documents and 240 copies. But lockdowns trapped bits of paper in shut-down offices. Printing became a palaver. When couriers eventually got to banks, they often found no one there.

Part of why the trade finance gap will grow to $2.5 trillion by 2025 is a financing crunch.

> To assess clients, banks and insurers rely on credit ratings. These have plummeted as firms‚Äô cashflows have dwindled. The resulting squeeze may linger, says Ebru Pakcan of Citigroup, a bank; firms are downgraded quickly, but upgraded slowly. Some lenders may focus on large clients or exit some markets entirely.

And the conclusion of the article?

> Still, the pandemic could lead to lasting gains by forcing the industry to digitise.

**COMPETITION**

According to The Asset, however, trade digitization is ["a priority for some, a wait and see for others."](https://www.theasset.com/treasury/41087/trade-digitization-a-priority-for-some-a-wait-and-see-for-others)

> Banks nevertheless have attempted to eliminate physical paper for their trade finance processes with global trade finance banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered executing cross-border letter of credit transactions based on blockchain networks for several clients already.

> Though these initial transactions are a step in the right direction for the overall industry, they still represent the minority of trade finance transactions and are actually not the main focus of banks when looking to digitalize trade finance processes. As the ICC survey reveals, the majority (55%) of banks surveyed sought to create online platforms instead to make it easier to request trade financing services, as opposed to 22% looking at distributed ledger technology such as blockchain.

Where bank enthusiasm for digitized trade finance falls short, non-banks will try to pick up the slack.

The unicorn Tradeshift, a cloud-based business network and platform for supply chain payments, is also struggling to do so, [having laid off hundreds in striving towards profitability](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/tradeshift-cuts-headcount-by-three-figures-in-effort-to-turn-towards-profitability/).

Flexport, whose main line of business is freight forwarding and not so much trade finance, is also struggling to do so, [having laid off 50 employees recently](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/flexport-layoffs/).

Even we.trade, a preferred Blockchain platform for bigger players, is also struggling to do so, [having cut some jobs because a recent funding round came up short](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-platform-we-trade-cuts-jobs-following-funding-slowdown/).

[Approximately 60 other trade finance players are trying to digitize](https://www.bbntimes.com/technology/coronavirus-hastens-trade-finance-s-blockchain-moment).  They are simply not doing so fast enough.

**LEADER IN THE FIELD**

Enter the leader in the field of disrupting trade finance through fintech innovation.  The Chairman of [the reverse merger company], Martin Jaskel, [commented on social media](https://i.redd.it/rn5dgq2wkib51.jpg):

> These consortia are all behind the leader in the field. Triterras ,soon to IPO on NASDAQ [...] The platform is powered by blockchain with all transactions insured from 85-90% for lenders. [...] New customers and lenders are being added on a regular basis.

While bigger players in business-to-business (B2B) trade finance are still paper-based, trade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [‚Äúmost innovative fintech company‚Äù in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).  One could call this paperless system a "beyond paper" innovation.

**TRANSACTION VALUES**

Based on the [Investor Presentation](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-029502/), the published transaction values are as follows:

Pro forma common equity value is approximately $853.6 million.

Proposed enterprise value is approximately $674.1 million.

**AGGRESSIVE GROWTH PROSPECTS**

While already profitable at $14.8 million EBITDA and $13.2 million net income, Triterras Fintech is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year. Of its $1.5 trillion total addressable market that is the gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $3.7 billion (finalized for fiscal 2019) and aims to more than double this, not just by the end of fiscal 2021, [but by the end of their next fiscal year, despite COVID-19](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/10/167452-triterras-a-blockchain-based-fintech-for-trade-finance-reports-23-7-million-in-revenue-14-2-million-net-income/).

According to Global Trade Review, [expansion into South America would help accomplish this](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/):

> Koneru adds: ‚ÄúThe platform is not limited geographically, but it started out with a focus in Southeast Asia and the surrounding regions. Looking forward, there is a growth opportunity and a lack of funding for SMEs in other areas. We are looking to expand and provide more trade financing options in South America later this year.‚Äù

System-wise, the company's Kratos platform started out as just a trade discovery module, before expanding this year into a trade finance module and a risk management module.  Later this year, Kratos will expand further into an insurance module and a shipping and logistics module.

Triterras Fintech is the Dominos Pizza of SME trade finance.  DP developed its app, then vaulted ahead past the traditional restaurant players.  Likewise, the expanding modules of Kratos demonstrate aptly the company's leadership in the field of disrupting trade finance through fintech innovation.

**CONCERNS**

Much of the revenues of Triterras Fintech is dependent on related party transactions with Rhodium Resources.  Both companies are owned by the same people.  Rhodium provides Triterras much of the transaction fees and trade finance fees projected in the Investor Presentation.

The binding, definitive merger agreement contains a "rights by any other name" arrangement, in the form of additional shares for initial shareholders of Triterras.  These performance earnouts can be issued regardless of the share price, provided that EBITDA targets are met.

**CRITICAL THINKING: VALUATION**

The contractual enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio was 8.0: $674.1 million / $84.3 million EBITDA in 2021.

In comparison, the S&P 500's enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio is over 14, a mix of growth stories and value duds.

The contractual enterprise-value-to-earnings ratio was 9.4: $674.1 million / $71.4 million net income in 2021.

In comparison, the S&P 500's P/E ratio is over 27, while the Russell 2000's P/E ratio is over 60.

[Northland analyst Mike Grondahl established an $18 price target for the stock, before taking it down a notch.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231872&headline=TRIT-Triterras-downgraded-to-Market-Perform-from-Outperform-at-Northland)

On the other hand, most reverse merger targets tend to go *down* after the completion of their business combinations.  Buy-and-hold, fundamental institutional investors tend not to buy directly from the arbitrage funds, which is the only way for non-hype reverse merger plays to avoid going down.

For the first six months of the new fiscal period, [Triterras generated $23.7 million in revenue, $17.3 million in EBITDA, and $14.2 million in net income.](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/10/167452-triterras-a-blockchain-based-fintech-for-trade-finance-reports-23-7-million-in-revenue-14-2-million-net-income/)  Each of these figures is less than half of their corresponding 2020 estimates contained within the Investor Presentation.  It remains to be seen how the company can meet the rest of the 2020 estimates, whether seasonality ought to be considered or not, and whether expansion into South America had been factored into the merger discussions.

Are the projected revenues, EBITDA, and net income for 2020 realistic?

Are the projected revenues, EBITDA, and net income for 2021 realistic?

Are the projected revenues, EBITDA, and net income for 2022 realistic?

Are the projected revenues, EBITDA, and net income for 2023 realistic?

What % of transactions are arm's-length transactions (i.e., not between Triterras and Rhodium)?

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TRQ - The investment deal of the decade and the Copper Bull case Been YOLOing TRQ since 2018. In 2019 due to leverage I was wiped out when there was a shock funding shortfall. Went back in again in 2020 with some leverage. I‚Äôm here to tell you about the TRQ fire sale and the Bull case for why the investment can be once in a decade opportunity 

TRQ has an open pit mine and is developing the underground Oyu Tolgoi, a lowest cost producer expected to be the 3rd/4th largest high grade copper mine in Mongolia that can last as long as 100 years with current reserves. Oyu Tolgoi is the only major mine besides Ivanhoe to come into production for this decade. Project footprint is the size of Manhattan. The underground mine has a depth of 1284 m (equivalent to 2.2 new World Trade Center towers) and is expected to sustain underground copper in October 2022 and ramp up production for years to come.  The mine will also produce significant gold.

Copper Bull case is from electrification and electric vehicles which requires 4x more copper than gas cars.  Also the charging power grid will consume just as much copper to build out.  Copper end game is to replace oil commodity to which copper should explode exponentially. Since EV is hot, the secondary play of commodities should pick up pace. There is a massive supply shortage of copper and it will just continue to grow with no end in sight.

TRQ currently trading for peanuts (.2 book value) for the risk that Mongolia is a horrible place to invest and that they love to trash their investors for political gains. The only thing that protects TRQ from the angry Mongolian mob which have received well over 10 B in inflow of investments are the international agreements and massive 5B debt from a consortium of international banks borrowed to fund the mine development. Other risk is RIO being the scumbags of corporate world has a controlling interest in TRQ and has been on a crusade to destroy shareholder value. The RIO end game reveal came in Q3 2020 when they tried to block TRQ from raising more debt to fund the shortfall. RIO wishes to force an equity dilution and get the remaining TRQ shares for free by backstopping the offering.  Fortunately for TRQ copper and gold have been on a tear delaying the shortfall and the TRQ CEO grew a pair and started Canadian financing arbitration against RIO their own parent company, sided with Mongolia on the investigation of cost overruns to which only could lead to blaming RIO, and said that the project should not be delayed due to RIO demands.

Oyu Tolgoi is literally Mongolia‚Äôs economy and if the politicians screw it up the country will lose its political/economic independence.

TRQ is the only copper producer with 4x ($60-$80) upside from just the story being played out thIs year. TRQ along with most copper stocks are thinly traded and swing easily on momentum. When Copper and gold makes new all time highs there is no limit to TRQ share price and the earnings will be supported by ‚Äúreal‚Äù billions in cashflows and future dividends. Rio Tinto will attempt to buy TRQ out before this happens if they see that their equity dilution strategy is to fail. 

Earnings will be phenomenal because they are extracting a ton of gold q4 2020 and 2021. In 2021 their earnings should be 1B and the market cap is currently 2.5B. If TRQ plays out there will be further expansions from known reserves for it to become possibly the 2nd largest copper mine.

TRQ was once one of the largest cap mining stock on the prospects of just a dream in 2011. Now that dream is soon becoming a reality at a fire sale price. I‚Äôm long with leverage and will hold until this story plays out. GL to all._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
