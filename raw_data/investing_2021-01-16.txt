 How many funds is too many in a portfolio? I’ve got approx $50k to invest. 40yo, wife and two dependants. $~200k Mortgage that is manageable. No other investments.  I have a separate amount of cash that means I should be able to weather any unforeseen medium term problems without touching any investment so I am expecting to put the investment away for the long term.

I want to build my own portfolio of low cost funds with a relatively aggressive mix of US and overseas stocks including a mix of large, mid and small caps.

I am an 18 year old in the United States. Currently employed with about $200 a month, after budgeting and sending some into savings, that I would like to begin investing. I have no investing experience but I would like to get started. Ideally, I would like to just put money into this for 30+ years and not touch it until retirement. I want to find a company that I can pay to do the investing for me. It is more appealing to me to pay someone who actually knows a thing or two rather than me just investing on a whim. I currently own no stocks, paid all cash for my current car, and have no payments such as college. I will be going to university next year but am planning on living at home and will be paying about 5 grand a year in tuition.

&#x200B;

With all  that background information out of the way here is what I am asking you all. What is the best robo-investor that you could recommend to me? One caveat that makes this a little bit more difficult is that my bank account is tied to my mothers name since I started working a few years ago when I couldn't open my own account, not sure if that is applicable.

&nbsp;

>The Buffett Indicator is the ratio of total US stock market valuation to GDP. As of January 14, 2021 we calculate the Buffett Indicator as:

&nbsp;

Aggregate US Market Value: $47.6T

&nbsp;


Current (Estimated) GDP: $21.5T

&nbsp;

**Buffett Indicator: 221%**

&nbsp;

>By our calculation that is currently 82% (or about 2.7 standard deviations) above the historical average, suggesting that the market is Strongly Overvalued. It has not been around this level since the Internet Bubble of the early 2000's. 

&nbsp;

>**Criticisms of The Buffett Indicator**
It is important to call out that no single metric is illustrative of the entire market, of course. The primary criticism of using the Buffett Indicator as a valuation metric (and particularly in late 2020 using it as a metric to justify the overvaluation of the market), is that it does not address the state of non-equity asset markets.

I'm trying to decode what specifically investing in "commodities" vs "commodity related equities" means for a retail investor and how to invest in them.

> **Currie said commodities, as an asset class, are better poised than commodity-related equities** to capture any sustained pickup in inflation pressures as COVID-19 vaccine distribution ramps up and governments add more fiscal stimulus to the policy mix.

> President-elect Joe Biden is expected to unveil a relief spending program worth around $2 trillion later Thursday, on top of a roughly $900 billion package approved last month.

> **While financial assets “anticipate the future,” commodities are spot assets that rise “as a hedge against potential inflation” and reflect “unanticipated physical moves in the real economy,” Currie said.**

> With the economy likely to “physically take off” with the vaccine-related improvement in economic activity, “you’re going to want to be long spot assets, real assets, so **we much prefer the commodity as opposed to the commodity-related equity,” he said.**

I'm thinking that investing in commodities, for a retail investor, means futures? Like ETFs or ETNs (like JJC)?

I'm thinking that "commodity related equities" are the miners or producers of the commodity supply, like CLX and MT are for steel demand. Is that correct?

If I'm on the right track, can someone who knows this area of investing discuss some more about what kinds of asset classes and securities are actual investments in commodities and what kinds of securities are "commodity related equities" aside from mining and refining stocks.

If "commodities" means actual futures and "commodity related equities" means the ETNs or other vehicles that enable retail investors to trade on futures, could someone who understands this area discuss this?

I do want to have significant allocation to commodities for a retired relative's conservative portfolio as we enter a period of elevated valuations and risk for stock market corrections.

Basically, I'm trying to find a strategy for investing in commodities for the next year

I have been offered to invest in a fund that trades binary options in Dubai (along with forex). It's run by a company called Psionic Group and each of their clients gets access to an app to see all live positions along with the loss/profit for each day. I personally know at least 4 people who sell this investment package. They claim they only had 1 losing month in 5 years' time, and guarantee 1% a month profit, paid each month, and any profit on top of that is reinvested and pays for the fees. However, you can't withdraw the deposit within the first 3 years.   


I see people who have invested with them cheering and claiming to have made 2% a day, 5% a month etc. I'm still not convinced, but struggle to find any fault with it apart from the fact that it's very unlikely to be profitable in "gambling" so consistently.

Obviously, if people go back to the office, then theres always a market and a real estate fun will be a valuable part of the portfolio. If work from home is the norm that market will not do so hot.

Of course we hear this a lot, and in a sense yes, if there were other places to put money then some people might do that. 1.5 on a 10 year note does not seem that impressive however.

Thanks for your thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Trading 212 Pies: From EV to 5G and Semiconductors, feedback and thoughts welcome? I've been experimenting with a feature on Trading 212 called Pies.

It's a great feature lacking on other platforms I use like Freetrade and Wombat Invest. The reason I'm such a fan of this is that it allows a range of great investment benefits, e.g. fractional investing, diversification, auto investing / pound cost averaging and the ability to create portfolios or themes.

At the moment, I've created four pies (basically themes) based on my personal interests and experiences in investing in individual stocks:

**Electric Vehicles (EV) & Auto Tech** \- [https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqiLwCBMY72](https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqiLwCBMY72) \- I searched long and hard for a suitable ETF and while a few keep getting mentioned like CRIV and iDRV I couldn't access these on the platforms I use. So I came up with this selection, which ranges from popular EV manufacturers like Tesla and Nio to battery and component stocks. They've performed very well individually and the great thing about this pie is that I can re-adjust the weightings when needed. Currently Tesla and Plug Power are very prominent due to current growth but it won't last forever.

**Low P/E or Potential Value Opportunities** \- [https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrLLyOufQJ](https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrLLyOufQJ) \- This is a collection of stocks (mainly British companies) that saw a massive drop due to Covid, Brexit or other factors. They all still have low share prices compared to their historic average and I expect to see substantial growth as the world returns to normal.

**5G and Semiconductors** \- [https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrMHRqMirC](https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrMHRqMirC). I follow [Fool.com](https://Fool.com) who were heavily promoting 5G stocks but I didn't want to pay for a subscription. I did my own research and this is a collection of stocks I have been investing in for around 1 year and they've all seen excellent growth.

**Medical Cannabis** \- [https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrLLudtBWN](https://www.trading212.com/pies/l7j0m6xQkOiMB02AuqqrLLudtBWN) \- I believe this is an up-and-coming industry with massive potential health benefits and likely to explode as governments around the world follow Canada.

Next steps are to create pies for Solar/Green and Hydrogen. I'm also planning to create pies for my children as it's an excellent way to establish an investment "portfolio" designed specifically for them and their personal interests.

The US market has vastly more investment opportunities than the Canadian market, with far lower fees.

As examples, per the calculators [here](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/calculators/) (all in non-registered accounts):

\- The combined MER and FWT drag of VEQT (CAD) is 0.27%

\- The combined MER and FWT drag of VT (USD) is 0.21%

\- The combined MER and FWT drag of VTI+VXUS (USD) is 0.14%

Another example would be QQQM (0.15%, USD) vs ZNQ (0.38%, USD), who have identical FWT treatment.

Disclosure: I own shares of NEXE._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will the underlying holdings in the ARKX already be priced in when it launches? The ARKX ETF will be launched later this year. However, I would imagine the holdings will be available earlier than the release of the ETF. Wouldn't the top holdings and the industry at large already account for the ETF launch?

Even the news of the ARKX ETF a few days ago caused a spike in stock prices for the industry. 

Would it be wiser to simply buy the top 2-3 holdings of ARKX or other noteworthy companies in the fund instead before the ETF launches? Curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about SEC filings? I am trying to read some of the SEC filings for AMC. When browsing through the SEC filing Form 4, Table I is pretty straightforward. But Table II is a little confusing. In column 5, it states that a member has (D) "Disposed" of shares. However in column 7, it shows that the number of shares that they have are increasing. How can their share value be increasing if they are "disposing" of their stock?

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on XL Fleet With all these EV stocks flying off the shelves, being absolutely ridiculously overvalued any thoughts on this hybrid EV stock and its upcoming earnings report date on feb11th? The stock went public through a spac in December 2020. Went to 35 then dipped into the low 20s. 
Client base consists of reputable large cap companies looking to electrify their current fleet vehicles. Tech seems solid, considering it doesn’t void factory warranties, and the ROI over vehicle lifetime is impressive. Can fleet electrification really be a viable solution for companies looking to slowly integrate electric tech in their fleet vehicles? Obviously their tech can’t be applied to individuals looking for mpg boost under the pretense of saving money. But for large companies the potential seems very real. Not sure what I’m missing, with all these other EV companies not bringing a dime to the table. Wondering if anyone else thinks this stock could be highly underrated.
Let me know why or why not this transitional EV tech is worth investing in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bitcoin/crypto miner stocks In the UK it has now become illegal to buy BTCE through a broker, which is disappointing because I cant use my Tax free investment ISA with real BTC. So as a substitute I've invested in RIOT and considering buying into ARGO too. 

They seem to correlate very strongly, but are much lower in market cap so are potentially good for better returns, assuming BTC keeps going up, as I believe it will. 

What are you guys opinions on these companies, and it's a good substitute for your ISA in the UK if you don't have and BTCE._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
