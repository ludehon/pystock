Earnings This Week: Disney, Walmart, Tencent, McDonald's Hey everyone,

Tons of important names [reporting earnings this week](https://assetdash.com/Stock/largest-companies-by-market-cap?m=Earnings)!

* **Chinese Stocks:** Tencent, JD, Pinduoduo
* **Retail Stocks:** Walmart, Disney, McDonald's
* **Internet Stocks:** Cisco, Palantir, Unity, DraftKings, Datadog

What are you watching this week?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions on $TTCF and $BYND both having there earnings tomorrow? The Tattooed Chef ( relatively new IPO ) and Beyond meat both have there earnings tomorrow? $TTCF are already making good revenue and have just expanded to online shopping. Do you think $TTCF is a competitor to $BYND In the plant based food market, in the future or not?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A case for bank stocks...are they a safe investment? So... bank stocks will probably be one part of my portfolio’s safer side’s investments. The question is: Are they safe? They tend to drop a lot in value during big recessions like in 2007-09. Of course that crisis’ main reason was heavily linked with banking, but I hope you get the point. I’ve realized that you should be picking one of the larger banks availible, since they aren’t gonna go bankrupt (as easily) if something catastrofical like the 07-09 happens. 

So investing in banks like $JPM or $BAC might be good. One quality I’m looking for is going for good/great dividends, that are steadily growing. I’m most likely to go with $RY since they offer a pretty good value with a dividend that’s been growing for a long time. Plus they are the biggest bank in Canada so it probably isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Is that a good choice? What do you think?

Do you have any bank stocks in your portfolio or do you have one that you’d like to share? Will be doing my own research as always!

As always, thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I buy and hold TQQQ for two years? I'm a freshman in college with $3000 dollars to spare. I expect tech stocks to do well in the next two years. If I put my money on TQQQ and hold it for two years that's not a bad strategy, right? even if it has a lot more risk to it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Has Square just 'Game Overed' Banks and every other fintech? They have p2p on lock huge growth.  They were first to bitcoin and actually bought it.  They have a robust merchant ecosystem....now every bank is trying to scramble and copy.  But its too late.

&#x200B;

Its near impossible to kill a leader, you need to be 10X better than their current product to get people to switch.  

&#x200B;

Now they are becoming a bank...so when rates rise they will get a tailwind by raising rates on loans etc.... 

&#x200B;

I'm shocked Amazon hasn't pulled the trigger and taken them out.  Which would allow amazon to see just about every small business transaction outside their network and cross sell even more.

  
Long story short SQ to 1K!++_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Portfolio diversifying and need your help! So I have been interested in stocks for the last 12 months. I haven’t invested any money yet but will be doing it during the next month or so. I am very young (17M) and looking to invest in the long term. This sub has given me lots of good hints whether it was a ticker or something else. Thank you for that.

To the main point. I am looking to do a diversed portfolio with big tech companies such as AAPL and MSFT having the major percentages of the portfolio. Don’t worry I know I’m young and will be doing some riskier investments/growth stocks (probably in tech). BUT seeing the result of COVID-19 doing some damage in the short term (and maybe little on the long term) I also need SOME stocks in different sectors which don’t get so much damage/ are less volatile than compared to some tech stocks WITH the ”safer” companies also paying good dividends and are able to up their dividend consistantly. 

Question nro. 1 goes like this: Can you name some of these stocks? I will be doing my research on my own still, but it helps a ton if you people can name some of these. I’ve already look some of them, which I’ll be investing in and these gets us to question nro 2...

Question nro. 2: These are the stocks I’ve already looked up, let me know if they are any good: $PG, $JNJ and $PEP.

And of course, thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone interested in BWXT? What are your thoughts on BWX Technologies?
The company has consistently beat earnings and has strong financials. I also think that they have a bright future with the growth of nuclear energy. As a provider of nuclear reactor components for US naval submarines and aircraft carriers, they have a strong base and their plans for the expansion of their operations are great._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2 energy stocks with a Biden connection  

Jonathon Silver is a green tech CEO who worked with the Obama administration (so with Biden as well) investing a $40 billion green energy fund. He's currently heading-up green tech investment for Guggenheim Securities but is still on the board of two companies:

PLUG

NGG

PowerPlug has seen some gains recently, presumably from a presumed Biden win. Its valuations are a little crazy (23 p/s, 21 p/b) and debt-to-asset ratio is not great. Still might materialize into great value though, especially if Silver ends-up serving a role in the Biden admin. Seems like hydrogen, while it won't compete with EV's for personal vehicles has a niche in commercial vehicles (b/c of weight and range issues).

National Grid, while a much different company, has more palatable valuations (p/e 25 p/s 2.2 p/b 1.6) and less leveraged than PLUG. They have been moving into renewables and AI/IoT tech upgrades to grid management. Election day provided a bump but NGG is still trading below its 52 week high by a bit.

Not promising that either stock will moon because of this connection, but its something to keep in mind as Biden preps his transition team. If Silver's name gets dropped a few times, it could be worth keeping an eye on these stocks.

Do you guys think that there is any chance that it will return to its former glory? Or are there better options?

Also, I was wondering if any of you happen to know if it is perfectly legal for a US resident to buy Cannabis stocks such as Aurora Cannabis. HEXO, Cronos?

Thank you for your time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Received notice to participate in a class action against NKLA from my bank Hey everyone, not really sure what I should do, so I’m here to ask! I just received a notice directly from my bank to participate in a class action lawsuit for NKLA. I won’t divulge details, but I was wondering if this was for people who would have a net loss from the stock, or if people who reported net gains from the stock would also participate._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell me on oil stocks long term I was curious if anyone was bullish on oil long term. I just looked at four major oil stocks five year charts and all seemed to be cut roughly in half. With the growing prevalence of green energy and growing number of plastic alternatives I don't see this as a viable sector to be involved in. Dividends are respectable but if the sector nearly goes away I can't see that as a long term thing. The broader market appears to agree with my conclusion at first glance. Does anyone disagree? And if so, why?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Researching a stock/etf Hello everyone I am relatively new (6 months) to investing and I am just wondering what you guys do when researching a stock (what sites do you use and how do you determine if it’s a buy) I have a strategy but I’m curious what you guys do and how to improve what I already do._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biden wins | nVidia stock |NetFlix stock |Buffet’s stock moves & more [11-8-2020] **Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen’s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let’s talk about everything** 

Hey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next

So late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk’s prime minister, Canada’s prime minister, France’s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden’s.

So this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)

Yesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.

Bank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)

And as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time.

Here are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)

Nvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks.

Buffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company’s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.

The company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)

The buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire’s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company’s stock as long as they believe it’s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.

I just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix’s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.

Microsoft Corp. is making a serious attempt to attract fans in Japan with its new consoles and network services. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based Sony Corp. moved its PlayStation business headquarters to California in 2016 and has built the U.S. into its largest single market.

But Microsoft’s targeting of the world’s third-largest video-game market -- including with services that can be accessed across a variety of devices -- could potentially yield strong results. As the Xbox has virtually zero presence in the country, there’s plenty of room for it to increase its share.

But Microsoft, which is launching its next-generation consoles in Japan on Tuesday, the same day it does so in the rest of the world, sees an opportunity in the country’s market. Microsoft didn’t start selling the Xbox One in Japan until almost a year after the U.S., which contributed to its disappointing sales in the Asian country._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir - Earnings & Democratic Election Win Play How will Palantir stock price play out in the short term given they have earnings out this week but more importantly The Democratic Party will be in the White House from next year?

Obviously with Biden winning the election sustainability is on everyone’s mind. Personally, I consider myself a green investor and already built up decent positions in companies like ENPH and RSG..

However, the only analysis in terms of green stocks are those in green energy such as solar, wind, solar components, etc. Has anyone done their research on SAF (sustainable aviation fuels)? I work in private aviation and I’ve noticed more and more growth in talk about development and use of SAF over the years. In fact, last year during the WEF there were (I believe) around 30 independent operators who traveled to and from the WEF utilizing SAF. Currently, it’s not widely used due to the premium cost but large-scale manufacturers, like Gulfstream, already have several aircraft which can operate on either traditional Jet A or SAF (such as the G650).  

I was checking out a Market Insider article from April which discussed that the SAF marker is expected to see CAGR of 56% from 2020-2024. This is a pretty consolidated market with only a few players. I was wondering if anyone is checking this out? I think it can be a HUGE investment opportunity given our increasing push for green initiatives and electric doesn’t really work for jets. The article mentions HON, GEVO, NTOIY, and some others as notable companies in this space.

If one begins to regularly sell their holdings as income to live off of they eat into the compounding growth and run out of stocks eventually. It probably wouldn't take terribly long to not have gains that adequately meet living expenses in this scenario.

I imagine a good way to achieve a living off these long term investments for someone who doesn't want to bother with the time of day or swing trading would be to rebalance and transition enough of their portfolio into an actively trading investment brokerage. I looked at the success of Titan Invest for instance. They actively trade for you profitably (ideally), keeping your time free. The profits then grow your account, meanwhile the gains can be accessed for living expenses without harming the continued growth rate of the account.

Basically if a longterm investor ever reaches a point where they're gains have been consistent enough to provide sole income for a few years in a row, is the only way to live off these capital gains without eating away your holdings and then finding gains have diminished in a compounding way until they're no longer enough to survive on would be by transitioning into active trading methods?

Thoughts on Nio? 

The electric-vehicle market has plenty of room for growth in China, and Nio seems to be a key player in that market. 

China definitely is pushing for EV to become the norm, and so Nio seems is good stead to keep on with their growth being as though the market and government backing are proving favourable. 

NIO announced early in October that it had delivered 4,708 vehicles in September, an increase of 133.2% year over year. 

NIO has a market capitalization of $26.6 billion and is valued at roughly 12 times this year's expected sales. 

There’s also rumours they’re moving into Europe, planning to sell 7,000 of its ES8 and ES6 SUVs on the Continent within two years.

However unlike Tesla, NIO doesn't yet have a factory of its own; its vehicles are built under contract by Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group.

Although, as part of its "Battery as a Service" strategy, Nio also runs battery-leasing and battery-swapping services. Essentially, the car and the battery are sold separately. Subscribers to the program can rent the battery for a monthly fee.

Having said all that, Ford and voltwagen are also moving towards EVs and have much more capital and factories of their own, so could easily outpace Nio, as could Tesla. 

Should I be bullish?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it worth joining motley fools subscription So i maybe want to join the motley fool stock advisor subscription but i am not sure if it is worth it. It is 99$ for a whole year and you get two stock picks every month, plus acces to their platform.

It seems there is true evidence that motley fool beats the market for almost 15 years with great numbers with the stocks they pick, so i thought it could be beneficial to use it and spend some money that i have in investing in stocks that they pick, instead of researching stocks myself.

Does anyone have experience with this motley fool subscription and do you think is worth it. Or give some opinions about motley fool, because i am going to use it to evaluate buying it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO shorts have lost at least $2.66 billion this year https://www.google.ca/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/11/08/nio-shorts-lost-at-least-2-66-billion-this-year/amp/

According to this post, people attempting to short $NIO have instead lost money.

Shorting a stock is when a person sells a stock (and can be done without ownership of that stock) in anticipation of buying it back at a lower price. When the anticipation is incorrect and the price of that stock goes up instead, then that person must buy back the stock at a higher price (hence, the loss of money)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Teledoc- an buy? They’ve managed to do well in the current climate with their virtual health care offering. 

It’s has seen its shares skyrocket 146% this year, soundly beating the S&P 500 and its 8.5% returns.

Virtual visits for the three-month period reached 2.8 million, a 206% increase from the prior-year period.

For perspective, Teladoc's virtual visits totaled 4.1 million for all of 2019. It's on track to smash that number this year, already reporting 7.6 million visits through the first nine months of 2020. 

As a result of the strong increase in virtual visits, Teladoc's top line also got a big boost in Q3, climbing 109% to $288.8 million

With all this being said it looks very promising and I’m considering going bullish- does anyone have any thoughts against doing so? 

[Motley Fool Data](https://www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/07/3-bullish-numbers-from-teladocs-q3-results/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you guys feel about the formula of calculating the intrinsic value/fair price of a stock? So you basically calculate it by first getting the future price, so....

EPS*(1+Growth)^10 *PE

after that you do a reverse to date, which is

Fair value = Future price/(1.15)^10 

And that’s how you get the ”fair value” of a stock. It seems very hard to get that value so low and that’s why it bugs me a lot. What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New TSLA, ENPH, TTCF or UPWK hi So 2 of those mentioned stocks I have found in here,

common for all 4 is that I hat a good time (2018, 2019, 2020 and 2019) have bought them at a good time with 1/4 or 1/8 of all my money.

now I want to know what is the next hot stock.

ENPH I knew almost nothing about but from reddit and yahoo boards I could hear that some sound convincing. I know many don't recommend this strategy but it has worked for my largest investments.

TTCF I believe will be the same deal and is a nice buy before 2021.

So.

what is new and hot besides vegetarianism /veganism and freelance work portals?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ investment rules advice? hi guys, i'm a 13 year old kid looking to get into real investing as i've had decent success with stock market simulators and mock stocks such as a %110 percent annual gain, so i've laid out 2 platinum rules for investment

1. invest in things that can change the world in any way
2. invest in things that can give people amazing opportunities

does anyone have any advice? are they good and are they enough? also i currently reside in Turkey so is there any way i'd be able to invest in foreign stocks from there? i'm looking to do startup investing too and start that with Detroit FC and PhorMed ( but it seems insanely sketchy so idk about that one).

any tips and advice on the 2 rules and in general? thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Trade Desk DD Investment Thesis for: The Trade Desk (TTD) – Disrupting Online Advertising with Real Time Bidding Platform

The Trade Desk just killed their earnings and are a big portion of my portfolio. Heres some information on why I am so bullish on them long term.

Summary: 

The Trade Desk is a self-serve cloud-based advertising platform that connects ads sellers to ads seller using a real time bidding system and helps their customers. Customers can create, manage and optimize their campaigns, and help the customer both choose what sites to advertise on and also what types of ads (display, audio, video, text, social) through multiple delivery channels (mobile, desktop, connected TV) they should use for their company using data driven analytics.

Qualitative:

·  Self-serve platform digitizing the old advertising transaction method, as opposed to in the past when it was typically manual transactions with large sums of money.

·  Founder lead CEO - Jeff Green is a fantastic CEO, he is a visionary and he has executed very well so far operating the company and is very ambitious when tackling this massive market. CTO has been with the company for 10 years, CFO joined in 2019 from Amazon, he was VP of Finance for the International Consumer business.

·  The Trade Desk is perfectly positioned in the middle of a Massive trend – the shift from traditional media advertising to digital advertising.

·  Excellent financials –

o  Impressive profitable revenue growth of 30%+ post pandemic 

o  High gross margins of 75-80% I think there is room for expansion 85%+ as more ad dollars move to digital. 

o  Profit margin historically hovers around 15-20% I think this can grow to 30%+ long term. Proven lucrative business model. 

o  Good balance sheet 

§  Cash: 426M 

§  Short Term Debt: 0

§  Long term Debt: 142M

§  Current Ratio: 2.04

§  Debt to Equity: 1.43

·  Big partnerships having ad placement opportunities for eBay, Spotify, Walmart, LinkedIn, Google, partnerships with companies like Oracle and Adobe to gather third party data for clients.

·  The Trade Desk has massive market opportunity as digital ad spend was 333B in 2019 and is estimated to grow to 517B by 2023, and will only have 60% of total media ad spend.

·  The Trade Desk makes money through the fee they charge their advertisers, taking a percentage of their gross media spend. They also generate revenue by connecting customers with third-party data sets, and create their own datasets to measure modeling and campaigns as a means to up-sell. Another additional fee upsell TTD has is they offer account management services.

·  Customer retention remained over 95%, as it has been for 5 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lets talk about AMC Predictions? 

I've read they will likely go bankrupt (like Hertz) they are trying to survive so hard... you can now rent a whole theater for ur self for $99, like wtf... those are trully emergency measures. Fot me it sounds like they will not hold 2 more months. Short it? 

Any thoughts on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for some good value and blue chip stocks to balance out my portfolio against my growth stocks. The title says it really. Good and a growing dividend is also a big plus! Maybe outside the tech industry since most of my other stocks will include tech, BUT again if you know a good stock in the tech industry, please tell about it! Looking for long term stocks of course, since isn’t that blue chip stocks are about? Getting your money in the long term with steady income and dividends? Don’t worry I’ll be taking your suggestions with caution and will be doing my own research!

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys think will happen to the cannabis market now that biden won Biden in his younger years was hard against all drugs, but now he seems to be more easy going about it. He said that he would be for the decriminalization of any past cannabis offensives, but it doesn't seem like he will make it federally legal. I think that he will help the cannabis market move forward greatly and that cannabis will be a long hold stock to put 5-10k in and wait 5-10 years and you will see come back, but i wanted to know some other opinions on both short term and long term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ STELLANTIS 
 So we know that Peugeot and Fiat plan to merge. I own some peugeot stocks, what happens to them after they merge into stellantis? It is not really a company acquisition so i am not sure what will happen since i am kind if new to investing. The CEO of the new company will be the peugeot one if that make any difference. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on dividend stocks that might do well under a Biden Presidency? Possibly in the market for a dividend stock that would do well under Biden.  Some of the common suspects don't seem to be good options, e.g.:

* Energy stocks (e.g. XOM, CVX) - they are already struggling from COVID, Biden will phase out fracking and will favor green energy

* Defense stocks (e.g. GD) - at best, defense funding will remain consistent, but it could also dip; I don't see defense funding rising to any significant extent

* REITs (e.g. O) - reeling from COVID, there might be another shutdown (limited or full)

* Telecom (e.g. T) - again, COVID issues, and I haven't heard any Biden policies that will revitalize telecom

Any stock ideas?  I will of course do my own DD, but just looking for some names to look into.

Also, I'm not interested in political debate or intrigue, but I only mentioned Biden as the macro we are working with._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
