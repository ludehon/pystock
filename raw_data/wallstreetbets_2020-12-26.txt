Because I'm a naturally skeptical person, particularly when anonymity is a feature, I offer proof to avoid any BS below.

**Confessions of a Voyeur:**

I enjoy reading about insanely degenerate "YOLO" moves or some of the all-in or bust plays but that's not my style and I suspect not the style of many on here so I thought this might help to see another flavor. Having read and been entertained (and inspired) by some of you who have shared your stories I have decided to do the same to offer a slightly different perspective and I of course do not mean to criticize any other strategies. I actually thank all of you who have shared your gains and losses for our collective entertainment. The big losses especially always help to keep me grounded to a strategy of going after double and triples instead of only grand slams. In fact, quite the opposite and I'll have a few shout-outs that come to mind below.

**A Journey of Five Years to Seven Figures:**

I will keep things brief because I know only a fraction of the membership can read, and then another fraction within that grouping can read more than a few sentences, but I think it's crucial to draw a line in the sand when I really got serious with this goal as 2020 marks the first time I rolled over $1M.

I would say 2015 was the year when I started making what I would deem *good money*, at least in my eyes. A top priority of mine was to pay off all debt (minus a mortgage) and I achieved that. At the end of the year, though, I was lucky enough to be blessed with a CPA who explained something to me which has guided my investing ever since. **He explained how an IRA account works, the different types, and most importantly the fact that taxes are deferred. This is critical to understand if you're serious and I'll cover that below.** At first I thought I was misunderstanding him but long story short, I was not. While I would say that since starting my career I was hyper focused on my business I would also say I was equally focused on tax-minimizing strategies and when I learned about deferring gains until far into the future I was hooked!

At the very end of 2015 I opened my first two IRA accounts, a Roth IRA and a SEP IRA, and in the first quarter of 2016 I fully funded both to the max.

Candidly, while in life I'm fairly comfortable with risk (I gamble regularly, I ride a motorcycle, business risks, etc) I would say I'm more conservative on the investing side (relative to the degens I find here). The first few years of my investing was essentially comprised of maxing out my annual limits on any IRA I could open (those familiar with Roth and other types will know about AGI thresholds limiting what accounts can be contributed to or not) and utilizing index funds as a form of passive investing.

**Pro Tip #1: If you're not maxing out your IRA accounts annually if you can afford to you're retarded, period. And if you don't have any IRA accounts to invest in after reading this then you might be mega-fucking-retarded.**

At times I stupidly thought I'd "time the market" and I'm embarrassed to say that during this incredible bull market run we've been having since 2010-ish there were occasions where I'd move to cash because I didn't want to have any big drops. I've done a lot of reading on this topic since and I think this was a combo of stupidity first but also the age I was when the 2008/2009 crash happened and how it warped my perception of the stock market in general. Though I have had plenty of losing plays, particularly moments of gay beardom where I'd short companies, the bigger mistake was thinking I had even a slight ability to spot market highs and lows.

**Pro Tip #2: Basically 99.9% of** **~~gamblers~~** **investors have no real ability to consistently time the market.**

In 2018 I decided to take a more active role in my wealth accumulation and this is where my tax aversion strategies really paid off. Because I had been maxing out every IRA account I could get my hands on (eventually ended up with a SEP, Roth, and solo-401K) I had \~$200K of contributions through 2017 and once I threw in my full 2018 contributions I was off to the races! Now, not all of my money is in retirement accounts unfortunately and my strategies of plays are largely dependent on the account in which I'm making the play (meaning, plays that are short term in nature are made from retirement accounts and plays that are long term go through my non-retirement accounts).

**Pro Tip #3: The CV19 dip was probably a once in a century type of opportunity. I say this because it happened so fast AND it recovered so insanely fast and strong. Don't expect every year to be like 2020 for investing. Growth I had during CV19 was much more luck than skill.**

This year was exceptionally lucky for me, and for many others as we've seen, but in my case it was mostly due to the fact that much of money was in cash when Covid really hit in March. Not all of it, unfortunately, but because of my natural tendencies to want to focus on protecting against downside I do tend to have more in cash than most people on a percentage basis. That was beneficial to me this year, in past years not so much, but I think overall for the past several years I might be break even or possibly slightly ahead. But having cash on hand when the market tanked in March was extremely lucky without a doubt.

I would like to dedicate a brief paragraph to luck, a subject that comes up as a throw away a lot here but something that I don't think gets a full amount of appreciation. I have been lucky in life across the board, and in the areas of life that it counts most. In family, in relationships, in friendships, in business, through some close calls I've had on motorcycles, and countless other ways. Investing takes luck as well and that's just to be in the game. Lack of luck definitely happens in investing too so as far as my investing goes I don't attribute much of my growth to luck per se. Instead I would say that being lucky enough to have the support system of great people around me, which is all the luck I could ever ask for, provided me the strength to get through some losses and to have some moderate level of confidence as I started having some wins.

**Journey From Occasional Gay Bear, Frequent Degenerate, and Eventual Consistency:**

I was born a gay bear. By that I mean I am naturally untrusting and that goes for people, studies I read, data I see... you name it I'm skeptical. I believe a certain amount of this is healthy but in investing it's the kiss of death. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU ARE WRONG! By that I mean even if you spot a fraud (think NKLA, KODK, etc) the stock can still go up. Why?? BECAUSE STONKS ONLY GO UP, and amazingly that stupidity is actually true, who woulda thunk??!?!

When I became active with my investing I was lucky enough to get burned on some small shorting ideas that all failed to one degree or another. I say lucky because they were small and they happened at the start and so I was then able to learn my lesson and never do that again. Though I have not developed much of a strategy to brag about I can share some (probably obvious) things that have worked best for me:

1. As much as I can control myself to do so, I stay away from options. Frankly, I don't have enough conviction in most of my ideas to be willing to predict both the price and timing of how they'll perform. And I am too lazy to fully learn all of the intricacies needed to be consistent with options.
2. I don't consider myself particularly skilled at picking up trends so I prefer to place bets on more established mid-caps. Sometimes I think they're getting unjustifiably beat down, sometimes I think they have a bright future and/or the ability to outperform the general market. I do still have my degen moments and I can't help but play around with some smaller companies too.

**Why Taxes Matter With Investing:**

I've already written about this at length so I'd first suggest reading: [Tax Info to Cuck Uncle Sam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4phe2/tax_info_to_cuck_uncle_sam_so_simple_even_a_wsb/)

Myself and other members on here have also pointed this out ad nauseam and yet most of you fucking idiots are still investing in non-qualified Robinhood accounts BUT I WANT TO HELP AT LEAST A FEW PEOPLE. To make a long story short, if you intend on growing an investment account and not using it for your regular life expenses you are a fool if you're not doing this in a tax-advantaged way. I have seen at least a dozen people this year that have turned small sums into 7-figures and to do that within a tax advantaged environment means you would owe $0 this year in extra taxes. Even if you took $10k and turned it into $20K this year, which would be great by the way, then wouldn't it be greater NOT to owe taxes on that short-term gain??

If you're trading today because you need the money tomorrow then this doesn't apply but a lot of us are trading for fun, or to learn. If your job creates enough income to pay your bills then I think the smart move is to treat your investments as your retirement money when you have no income (beyond measly social security) so it only makes sense to lock it up today in exchange for tax breaks that will compound into huge savings down the road.

My strong strong strong suggestion would be to have both types of investing accounts, what are known as qualified and non-qualified (aka retirement and non-retirement) accounts. This will allow you to utilize qualified money for your short-term plays (less than 12 months) and your non-qualified money for your plays that are expected to last more than 12 months.

**Treating Investing Like Poker:**

I consider investing to be much like my experience with poker. Before CV19 I played occasional live tournaments and what I learned while doing that has been more important than the obvious stuff above.

* The importance of not getting knocked out. To win a tournament you have to be in the tournament and so a reckless strategy of frequent all-ins is not just risking your buy-in, it's risking your ability to remain in play. ICM is what I believe this formula is known as within the poker world.
* If I win chips, you lose them. It is a very zero-sum game like that. We celebrate our fellow degens here on WSB as royalty among us but one man's victory is another man's defeat and I feel it is important to always be aware of this just for the sake of empathy.
* The more people playing the bigger the prize pool. Anybody who has played in a poker tournament before has noticed that the more entrants the more the total prize pool grows. This seems to be the same with the market because the more appetite retail and institutional investors have to participate in the market the more companies want to go public to take advantage of that appetite. This means the winners win bigger, but interestingly, the losers don't lose bigger. IE unless you buy in more than once (which is why I don't risk going bust), a loser only loses one buy-in but the winner (or those that place in the Top 10) gets the benefit of all of those losers' buy-ins making up a bigger final score.
* THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE: You don't have to win First Place to make money. In general you can place anywhere in the Top 10% and typically double your money, or better.

**Brief Catalogue of The Winners & Losers:**

I place this last because I don't think it's very important but some of the tickers I did best on were JD, PDD, SQ, LUV, CHWY, CCL, PLTR, CRM and more recently I've been dabbling with SPACS. I'm also part of the GME gang now because of WSB and so far I couldn't be happier! The degen in me still awakens occasionally. I still hold some of those and that's not a complete list. My biggest losses came from shorting HLF and shares of NAT, CHK, and a few others I can't remember. Perhaps it's PTSD that I can't remember.

**My Final Reflection & Perspective For Those Who Are Still Reading:**

More than anything else I'd like any reader of this post to realize that doubling or tripling your money is hard, but it's a lot easier than making 10X or 20X or 50X like some on here have been fortunate to do. **In fact, even doubling or tripling your money over a period of a few years is fucking hard!** I fear that people see a handful of individuals make 10X, 25X, 50X, etc and then think they're "doing something wrong" or feel inclined to take obscene risks in an attempt to duplicate that pattern and I frankly feel it's a fools errand. Admittedly I enjoy reading about those plays too, and I give props to those Gods of Investing who walk amongst us mortals, but I like watching high stakes poker and yet I realize that I am unlikely to ever be playing in those games because of my tolerance for risk. AND THAT IS OKAY! My goal is not to be a billionaire. My goal is to be happy in life and enjoy the company of those most important to me and that's what I was doing before I hit the 7-figure mark and that's what I'll be doing as I continue to (hopefully) grow my portfolio bigger. My main strategy as always will be to not lose money as much as possible and to happily take a 25-30% gain vs. always chasing the clouds.

For full disclosure, I didn’t hold it, but I just checked it this morning and it’s up 216% since March. Yes I’m happy with my big PLTR gains and some small QS ones, but as much as I am a fan of maxing out my gains, I also like to do so with the best sharpe ratio possible. So I think $IPO might have a good run next year too. 

The big IPO’s I’m waiting for in 2021 are R0bl0x, Affirm, and Petco, and I will literally be betting my entire portfolio that these will be winners. I mean come on, Petco’s ticker will literally be $WOOF. So I will be buying these ones in particular, but aside from these, I really am not too sure about the others. 

I bet there will be nice 60% - 100%ers, but I know we’re going to be seeing a lot of what happened with ABNB and DASH, so maybe reverting back to the classic WSB SPY days will be the play, except just with $IPO instead of SPY.

As the semiliterate among you know, GameStop was scheduled to present on the last day of the ICR Conference (an investor conference for public & private companies to show off how big their shlong is going to be when fully pumped) on January 13th, under the retail category. GameStop analyst extraordinaire (I won't speaketh the naughty Eeking Salpha words, mods) Justin Doperiala at DOMO Capital caught this minor, yet massive tweak.

At some point in the last few days, GameStop was shifted from the Retail & Consumer category on the 13th to now present under the TECHNOLOGY category AH on Jan 11th. What does this mean? Management may not be-a-buncha-bitches after all. They clearly requested the category switch and have something TECHNOLOGY related to share. M&A? Strategic shift/review? DIGITAL FIRST OMNI-CHANNEL?!?

Now, #WeWantCohen and there's really nothing the boomers can say to change that. But what they can do, is speak boomerish in a way that the other market participants are made aware of the tech & e-commerce opportunity that has not been valued in any way by the market (yes, even at $20/share the stock is an easy 2-3x+ on fundamentals over 2021-2022).

Melvin's put position was rolled to Jan21 (see here: [https://imgur.com/a/BGSxG91](https://imgur.com/a/BGSxG91)), and management surely knows this. Could they be competent after all? Yes. This tells us they are dropping dongs. Now will Melvin bend over and take it? Doubtful. But don't believe the FUD. The upside opportunity and near term re-rating has been enhanced by Management's choice of the words TECHNOLOGY in this case.

p.s.: GME 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME. Not YOLO update. 12/24. Collared 5k shares when it hit 22. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🎥Cineplex (CGX) – DD – The Movie Theatre Play You Have Not Been Paying Attention To 🎥 **Cineplex ($CGX) – DD - 🎥LIGHTS, CAMERA, MOON 🎥**

**The Company Cineplex**

(CGX) is a Canadian 🍁 movie theatre operations company. Actually, it’s really the only serious movie company in Canada, a North American country with 35 million people. Outside of movie theatre operations, CGX is involved in digital commerce and online e-sports platforms for competitive gamers. CGX was originally founded in 1912, headquartered in Toronto and essentially has a monopoly on the movie industry in Canada.

**NOTE:**

**For the RobinHood Crowd, see ticker CPXGF:**

[**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cpxgf/**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cpxgf/)

**The company has three business segments:**

Film Entertainment and Content (including a fast growing and innovative streaming service that out-competes any of the American movie companies).

Media and Amusement

Leisure

**TLDR (sort of)**

Cineplex (CGX) is Canada’s movie theatre company. With 164 locations across the country and 10 million accounts through its Scotiabank supporter SCENE program (there are only 35 million people in Canada), this really is Canada’s movie theatre. It has next to no competition in Canada and its stock has suffered incredibly during COViD and is wildly undervalued.

The company’s financials are sound, and it has completed several deals including arrangements with Scotiabank (one of Canada’s largest bank) in relation to its customer loyalty program as well as Universal in USA to ensure Hollywood pipeline for new releases and its streaming service (one of the best in the USA/Canada) is successful. Both deals happened just in the fall.

**Humans are social animals and will return in large numbers to the majestic experience of the movie theatre. This play has both short term and long-term upside – the upside in both cases is enormous. While risks exist here as with any deal, they are reasonable.**

A simple, predictable, cash flow positive company that is wildly undervalued and about to pop on stimulus news (back to fair value) and even more in Q1-Q2 on re-opening and widespread vaccination.

Given the pent-up demand for social activities like this, the pent-up production supply in Hollywood, and the fact that many are sleeping on this play, a big swing anytime in the next couple of months is possible, making options attractive.

Short term price target = $15 (+65% from current levels)

In the medium term = $30 (+230% from current levels)

**Background Info on the Play**

Pre-COVID the stock was trading at around $35, doing very well for itself and had secured a deal for takeover with Cineworld (big UK company). When COVID hit, CGX, like all money theatres clearly took a hit. CGX took another hit in that Cineworld abandoned the deal in light of the pandemic.

Since this time, the company has made several important decisions in dealing with COVID and planning for the future:

***Quick on their feet in response to COVID:***

They were responsible during the lockdown in the spring as well as into the summer when they re-opened their doors to millions of movie-goers.

They quickly implemented new COViD-friendly practices and discounting for patrons. o They brought back a ton of old movie names like Jaws, Tarantino movies, etc.

Private Venues - CGX began promotional offers for block bookings to use up the theatres, they were not screening movies in. For $120, 20 people could book a private party and choose from more than 1,000 movies to screen. These moves are anticipated to continue once the second wave of lockdowns lifts in early 2021.

Sale of their Headquarters to ensure further liquidity and the payment of debt

***Negative Tailwinds leading to the undervalued stock price:***

**1. COVID – Enough Said**

**2. Cineworld**

In 2020, after covid hit, Regal owner Cineworld Group (UK) withdrew its planned $2.1 billion takeover of CGX. The deal would have led to one of the world's largest cinema companies with more than 11,200 screens globally. The Cineworld pullout has impacted the stock as well and again we think it’s dropped too much even considering that failure. In July, CGX sued Cineworld for leaving the deal. We’ll see what happens.

**Specific Important Moves CGX has completed:**

**Scotiabank Deal (Scotiabank is one of the nation’s biggest banks) – December 2020 Deal**

On December 18th, CGX announced that they have entered into an agreement to enhance and expand the SCENE loyalty program by bringing together the full benefits of SCENE with Scotia Rewards, Scotiabank's flexible customer loyalty program. *In addition to providing SCENE's over 10 million members with the opportunity to redeem points for a variety of entertainment and dining options, beginning in the fall of 2021 members can look forward to redemption opportunities for a wide selection of brand-name merchandise from popular retailers.* Members will also have the opportunity to apply points as statement credits on certain Scotiabank products, as well as book flexible travel.

**Online Streaming Platform Deal with Universal – November 2020 Deal**

Cineplex is also well positioned in terms of long-term investments it made in the online streaming sector. CGX, as a theatre operations business in Canada is better positioned then any of the American theatre companies, who have been slower to adapt to COViD (and in many cases did not have this streaming infrastructure in place prior to COVID as CGX did). *CGX and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group announced a multi-year agreement for theatrical exclusivity windows in the Canadian market.* This new dynamic window agreement between the two companies preserves the theatrical experience, while adapting to changing consumer behaviour, particularly as the world and the entertainment industry navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

\*Similar to the agreements that Universal has established with other major exhibitors, coming into effect immediately, the agreement guarantees at least three full weekends (17 days) of theatrical exclusivity for all Universal Pictures and Focus Features theatrical releases, at which point the studio will have the option to make its titles available across premium video on demand (PVOD) platforms, including the Cineplex Store. Under the terms of the deal, any title that has a North American opening weekend box office of $50 million or more, including franchise titles, will play exclusively in theatres for at least five full weekends (31 days) before the title can be made available on PVOD.

**Financials**

On review of the companies 2020 Q3 financial report and on review of the balance sheet, CGX is not poorly position considering its sector, the pandemic, and the monopoly it holds in Canada.

The *current ratio* (ratio measuring assets to liabilities) for the company is around 0.45-.50. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. Textbooks report 2.0 or higher as a strong ratio. Movies and banks are different entities for sure. But context matters.

As of Q3 2020, Cineplex had US$350 million in outstanding debt on its balance sheet and a monthly cash burn rate at around US$15 million to remain in operation. The company has a lot of property to play with if need be. It will utilize the federal refund as well as rent forgiveness programs during COVID to manager operating expenses.

**Bull Case for the Future**

Ultimately, we all know that several sectors have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Many will not be a priority for government support or bailout. While this is sad for the economy, it also represents an incredible buying opportunity for those with some tolerance for volatility. Based on the analysis here, CGX is trading at an incredibly high discount when you take into account the balance sheet and a reasonable look to the future. **One thing to keep in mind here is the difference between the American and Canadian perspective on funding.**

*As mentioned elsewhere in the DD, CGX has the ability to receive government money and incentives. The Canadian gov is super liberal and would never let this flag ship die.*

**A few key points and some speculation to consider:**

The pandemic will come to a close. Companies as big as CGX who have not become insolvent thus far, will soldier on through the winter if their management makes the right moves. CGX has an exceptional management team.

***The in-person movie theatre experience is going to come back in a momentous way. Humans are social animals and there are few activities as gratifying to us as going to the movies with friends and family and loved ones. We make cherish memories with this sort of activity, its fun and it has an intrinsic value and purpose in our society.***

There is pent up demand for spending of all kinds. This isn’t limited to people going to the mall. They will flock to the theatres when this is all over as well. The mall and theatre stocks will be the last to bounce on the end of the pandemic news. Even more than airlines (because the GOV knows it can’t let them die).

Pent up demand for traditional consumerism is matched by the pent-up supply Hollywood has to offer. While production has slowed down in tangible ways, screenwriting etc, has not. How many scripts and plans were made during covid? The floodgates here are going to open. COVID 19 as a sub-genre in film is something that we will come to appreciate in the years to come.

***\*\*As the big player in Canada, CGX will be in a position to buy out any of the remaining small movie companies in Canada as we emerge from COVID and its financials improve.***

**Price Targets**

This is highly speculative. The company trades at $9 presently. Pre-pandemic is traded at around $35.

Its % in terms of asset/liability does not justify this stock price. Its fair value is somewhere in the mid to high teens right now, all things considered. *It traded at around $15 for the majority of the pandemic, which reflects this well.*

As hysteria lessons and as theatres re-open, this stock is set to move a lot. It has been hit very hard by the pandemic, the closing and failings of huge American theatre companies and the controversy over the Cineworld deal.

Short term price target in the next few months will likely mimic where it was during the lockdowns at $15 (**+65% from current levels**).

In the medium term as things get back to normal heading into Q3-Q4 of 2021 and into 2022 this stock is positioned to move back to $30 (**+230% from current levels**)

***\*\*\*\*\*\*Ultimately, the fact CGX has struck deals with BOTH Scotiabank and Universal in the last 60 days speaks to its agility and positioning in this hellish climate.***

**A fascinating play not without risk but with some very serious upside! Not financial advice! Good luck!**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why genetics is the best long term play The new vaccines made with mRNA are great, but imagine a vaccine that changed your DNA to make you immune forever. Some people are born immune to certain diseases, like entire villages in Africa that are immune to AIDs/HIV. Others pay loads of money for HIV treatment. Genetic therapy has the potential to introduce the genes that make the African villagers immune to anyone. This is not only a vaccine, but also a cure. There are so many diseases out there that because it is caused by a bacterium or virus, we don’t think of them as genetic diseases, but they really are genetic diseases also. 

Gene therapy itself, not just the research, is expensive as hell, but the benefits are too good for people not to pay for it.

Wish me luck! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why you should have all your money in Genetics I saw Cathie's outlook on Genetics and AI combining, and did my research. It has me convinced I should go super long on ARKG. Here is a video from a [MIT AI Chad and MIT Gene Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brslF-Cy3HU&ab_channel=LexFridman) \- the first of 3 on this podcast and my key takeaways were: Genes are cool as fuck. AI will do for the genome what it did for chess and Go. These companies have the potential to be the next FAANGs in exponential growth.

This isn't all some hype to make me shoot thiccer rope like Spiderman, but industrial level genetics engineering. Need gasoline? Modify a bacteria to eat plastic and shit gasoline. Need a new organ? Farm that shit off a super pig. Need a specific drug that's expensive to make? Modify a nonspecific fungal enzyme to biosynthesize it. There isn't just one good reason to be long here, there are tons. Shit will actually be a genomic revolution. I think the human genetics stuff is the least interesting actually because of how complicated it will be and all the regulations and red tape. Modifying bacteria/fungus and shit you can culture and scale is going to be the real money. If I could go more specific on those ideas I would but I'll take the ARKG basket for now.

It's going to disrupt major industries, and I guarantee genetics will help us combat climate change. We'll make bacteria that act as carbon sinks, and then retarded companies will pay tons of moneys to offset their carbon footprint to some assholes with giant vats of this shit in some barren wasteland just eating carbon dioxide and farting oxygen. It's going to change our world and make every industry it touches a level of magnitude more productive. This is the type of generational investment that Apple in 1996 or Google at IPO would have been.

The keys to unlocking the 'genomic revolution' that ARKG wants are really just processing power and AI. Google is actually important here and will have a hand in the tech end. Deepmind just figured out protein folding. Remember in 2004 when we all tried to cure cancer by running spyware on our computers? It's fucking solved, proteins are solved. These are the building blocks of life and will give us tools to make new novel proteins that actually can turn us into stretch armstrong or make our dicks huge and so on. Now that we figured that out, the next step is learning what genes we can edit to start modifying proteins in our own bodies, or for more profit, bacteria/fungus. You can make a fucking enzyme that eats cancer. This shit is in the pipeline.

tl;dr ARKG any strike. I'm in ARKG 105c 7/16 and wish I had more money to throw at it. There is nothing but room in this whole industry and it will change everything.

Did a lot of evening lecture on PLtR...

So many people expect it to drop when share lockdown gets removed sometimes in February from my understanding...

80% of the floats can free trade after this... def gonna be a drop for the SP since a % will take some profit...

However hear me out...

From now until that moment, we can have new NR of deals or renewed deal like we had lately... We will have demo day and ER which will demonstrate a continuation of revenu rise...

An other point I want to talk about is the fact that most of the people with that 80% float... are mostly insider, people with deep knowledge of what is palantir, their power, their goal and their future...

Now if I was working with them with 1 million of shares... lockup ends... if I’m convinced in what we do... might sale 10% for let’s say around 2.7M$... more than enough to buy nice stuffs... however with that knowledge expecting it to rise probably in a 50-100$ range... wouldn’t sell more than that 10% ...

PLTR trade a lot of shares everyday over 50M...

Fund managers couldn’t get into an iPO or Spac...

So in short I don’t believe the SP will drop that much on the lockup event... either it will have rise enough with the events I spoke about and might test new support of where we are currently consolidating but I truly don’t expect a dip under 20$...

Then there will be a strong « dip » buying from PLTR beeing a meme stock and all the funds wanting to get in while it’s cheap...

Also if it dosen’t fall like so many expect...

I’m pretty sure it’s gonna initiate a strong FOMO which could create a strong mania buying and rocket it to over 40$.... we’ve been cranking up for breakout!

So basically PLTR 30$ calls jan 21, may 40c (could also be shorter like march call

Buying shares and getting some cash ready to buy more when and if that dip occurs...

2021 will be the year where PLTR gets noticed big time

Now off to bed!

**Week of 12/21**

Boomer Joe Terranova said he had to sell Salesforce.com, inc. to raise capital to buy some other stocks. His decision is not about Salesforce being a bad business. He believes in the stock and it screens very high on his quality momentum index. He said he is pairing back the holding because he bought the stock too aggressively, too high.

Terranova is sure over the course of time Salesforce is going to move higher, but he decided to buy stocks that should work better in the near time. He bought other boomer stonks.

On CNBC's "Mad Money Lightning Round," Jim Cramer said Salesforce.com, inc. was up big on Tuesday and it still has a lot more to go.

Thanks for reading!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why 2020 capitalism is not as weird as it seems and PLTR valuation is not as weird as it may seems Merry Christmas, retards. After the guy that posted about Graham's book (that I am reading right now) inspired me to post this to teach some differences between back and now and why 2020 capitalism is not as weird as it may seems.

TECH COMPANIES DOESN'T DO CAPITAL EXPENDURES.

At least, not as much as an old company would do.

Take Walmart. Imagine that Walmart had 1B of earnings at their income statement. Great! The guys of Walmart could think "I think I can build 20 new stores that will make for my shareholders even more money in the future!". So he takes 500M of those 1B and build that juicy new stores that will make Walmart even more money in the future. The other 500M he will deliver to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.

When you read the P/E ratio of companies like Walmart it will make sense. They are making profit and, even better, they are reinvesting that profit to make even more profits in the future.

Nice.

What about companies like Palantir?

For a software company like Palantir there's two main ways for them to make money. They have to spend HUGE money in salespeople to sell their software and HUGE money in research and development to make even better software to sell in the future.

Palantir is building its Walmart stores through their income statement. Firstly, it's great because Palantir diminishing its profit makes then to pay less taxes. Why is that? Because the boomers that created accounting didn't understand how a software/tech company works.

Boomers at Wallstreet can't understand that many companies invest through their income statement.

If the folks at Salesforce would decide to make the company profitable, they could at a glance. They would keep only the developers needed to keep the business running and only the sales people to take care of the current customers. But they know that they can make even more money, so all the profit they earn they spend reinvesting on the business.

Even Berkshire Hathaway can understand today why paying expensive sales multiples (not earnings, sales) on Snowflake isn't a bad idea.

*I am not saying that at 40x revenue Palantir is at a fair valuation or not. It's just an example. But it explains why it seems that profits doesn't matter anymore. They matter.

I found this list of new SPACs and I decided to summarize what they are about. Here we go:

1) [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) AKA **PTAC** to **PRCH**

[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/ptac-stock-13-things-to-know-about-proptech-and-the-porch-com-spac-merger/): 

>Essentially, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) provides software to different insurance and moving businesses. In return, it gains access to the homebuyers those businesses are working with. From there, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) can sell additional services like TV, internet and gutter cleaning. Perhaps most importantly, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) represents yet another digital disruptor in the world of real estate.  
>  
>Additionally, Porch has struggled with profits. Its executive team says the deal will give them a blank slate and a chance to move past a history of losses.  
>  
>The company lost $49.9 million in 2019, $103.3 million in 2019 and is projecting $34 million in losses for 2020.  
>  
>However, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) will have no debt when it comes public via PTAC stock.  
>  
>Also importantly, the company became profitable in June with $7 million in EBITDA.  
>  
>Additionally, it is eyeing $120 million in revenue in 2021.

I give this one a **thumbs down**. This sounds like a lamer version of Zoom where you have a braindead one off software service platform that can only profit during an apocalyptic event. That being said I'm probably gonna sell a put or two against it for the lulz

2) Butterfly Network: **LGVW** to **BFLY**

[From an article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/butterfly-network-a-global-leader-in-democratizing-medical-imaging-to-be-listed-on-nyse-through-a-merger-with-longview-acquisition-corp-301177892.html): 

>Butterfly Network's mission is to enable universal access to superior medical imaging, making high quality ultrasound affordable, easy-to-use, globally accessible and intelligently connected.

>Butterfly iQ is the only ultrasound transducer that can perform "whole-body imaging" with a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. Connected to a mobile phone or tablet, it is powered by Butterfly's proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology and harnesses the advantages of AI to deliver advanced imaging that we believe is easy-to-use, improves patient outcomes and lowers cost of care.

I give this one a **thumbs up**. This sounds like a healthcare unicorn stock and anyone who knows about the healthcare sector knows that they jizz all over their special snowflake stocks like this one. Plus apparently bill gates invested in it. Do you think bill gates would ever let his investment thesis be wrong? If citron wrote a bearish research thesis on them then they'd all end up hanging themselves by paper thin sheets with a loaded gun smuggled in the cell and excessive bruise marks if you catch my drift. If you sell a share he will find you and send you to the place where the sun don't shine. 

So yeah shit is gonna moon

3) Ouster: Aka **CLA** to **Oust**

[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/cla-stock-colonnade-acquisition-corp-soars-on-ouster-spac-merger-news/): 

>Ouster is a creator of lidar systems that was founded in 2015.  
>  
>The company’s lidar cameras are used in several industries.  
>  
>Among these are the “industrial automation, smart infrastructure, robotics, and automotive industries.”

[Here's a better article I recommend reading](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201222005187/en/Ouster-a-Leading-Provider-of-High-Performance-Digital-Lidar-Sensors-to-Combine-With-Colonnade-Acquisition-Corp.-to-Accelerate-Digital-Lidar-Adoption-in-Industrial-Smart-Infrastructure-Robotics-and-Automotive-Markets).

So at first I thought this one was a dud since who the heck knows what Lidar cameras are. But apparently they are used in every application which requires light and motion sensing which is well literally all of them and going to grow even more as we automate our society further. This stock's got me moister than an ouster So yeah **buy buy buy**

**4)** Neurox Aka **BRPA** 

[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/brpa-stock-14-things-to-know-about-big-rock-partners-and-the-neurorx-spac-merger/): 

>NeuroRx is a clinical-stage small molecule pharmaceutical company.  
>  
>Investors should also note that it specializes in treatments for both Covid-19 and bipolar depression.  
>  
>Well, the two candidates that NeuroRx focuses on are rather appealing. The first is Zyesami, a drug the company is studying for coronavirus-related respiratory failure. As we continue to hear more about the worsening Covid-19 pandemic, BRPA stock represents a way to get in on the ground floor of a potential treatment.  
>  
>Additionally, the second drug from NeuroRx is NRX-101. This second drug is for suicidal bipolar depression and PTSD. Another unfortunate aspect of Covid-19 is the spike in mental illness. Therefore, the NeuroRx SPAC merger represents two critical areas in pharmaceuticals.

This might sound like a contrarian take but I'm actually a thumbs down on this one. It has upcoming catalysts but no one knows what they are and let's be honest does having two drugs in the pipeline justify this price point. There's plenty of stocks like this one with promising drugs but they trade in the sub 5$ range, not 28$. Plus you can't even trade options on it.

# I. Intro

Merry Christmas! I wanted to share my research concerning soybeans, and why I'm bullish on soybeans and am looking to invest directly and indirectly into soy production. I hope some of you guys find some value in this amateur analysis! 

# II. Background

The soybean or soya bean (*Glycine max*) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean and important for its oil and protein, which has numerous uses, to include feed for livestock and human consumption in both processed and unprocessed states. Globally, it is the sixth most produced crop by weight, only behind sugarcane, maize, rice, wheat, and potatoes. Every year, roughly 348 metric tonnes of soy is grown with a gross production value of $107B USD. Certain regions of the globe produce a majority of the world's soy - Brazil and the United States count for 70% of the world's production^(\[)[^(1)](https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/abs/2018/01/ocl170039/ocl170039.html)^(\]). Much of the growth in the demand for soy has been fueled by the rising standard of living for much of the world's population, which has caused the global demand for meat to skyrocket. China alone imports 60% of the world's soy (China is the world's top producer of pork)^(\[)[^(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_valuable_crops_and_livestock_products)^(\]). 

# III. Supply

The vast majority of the world's 348 tonnes of soy comes from a few locations.

[Only thirteen countries produce over one million tonnes of soy.](https://preview.redd.it/h1zi75qm7f761.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1189dc6cc215dbd47874b31a81c9d7720e8d268)

As shown in the table above^(\[)[^(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_soybean_production)^(\]), the combined production of the top two countries (Brazil and the United States) is greater than the following eleven countries (and the rest of the world) combined. Note Argentina's relatively small output, but not insignificant, as we'll come back to that.

# IV. Demand

About 85 percent of the world’s soybeans are processed, or "crushed,"  annually into soybean meal and oil.  Approximately 98 percent of the  soybean meal that is crushed is further processed into animal feed with  the balance used to make soy flour and proteins. Of the oil fraction, 95  percent is consumed as edible oil; the rest is used for industrial  products such as fatty acids, soaps and biodiesel^(\[)[^(4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112075924/http://www.soyatech.com/soy_facts.htm)^(\]).

**IV.A. Livestock**

As the rest of the world continues to industrialize and the standard of living continues to increase for many people, we will see the continued demand for meat to increase. It is estimated that the majority of soy is used as livestock feed, so we can assume that an increase for meat products will translate into an increase for soy.

**IV.B. Human Consumption**

**IV.B.1. Foods**

Soy and soy products have been consumed for all of recorded history in East Asia. In China, there's some evidence that points to soybean cultivation as early as 7000 BC^(\[)[^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3208558/)^(\]). Many countries in the eastern hemisphere have traditionally used soybeans in their cuisine. In the modern world, soy is integral in making processed foods. 

**IV.B.2. Soyboys**

[Increased demand for soy products in the western world.](https://preview.redd.it/fb6uhb4lbf761.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e3a994ce1b98671e4621d6123b8d27a622ac51)

# V. Analysis

Hopefully by this point you're convinced that the soybean is an integral part of the global food supply chain that is consumed directly in foods made with soybean or indirectly through processed foods and meat. Well u/SoyFuturesTrader, this is cool information and all, but what can I do about it? If I'm just excited and bullish on soy, what ultimately matters to me?   


Well, to keep it concise I'll have to ask you to make some assumptions with me, but if you'd like some clarification just ask and I will try my best to expand upon it. 

1. Worldwide demand for soy will increase.
2. Global food and energy supply chains will not disintegrate overnight.
3. The places that need soy (for eating or to make creatures eat it to eat the creatures) don't have soy (or enough of it).

[Note countries that can export food and produce soy - the US, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina.](https://preview.redd.it/7x4tyxh3df761.jpg?width=2545&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0aa6d217b6a1898b5de6d0c6dd6cc6f8cedd299)

[Arable land is not distributed equally across the globe. It is notable how lacking in arable land China, Japan, and the Gulf \(only Saudi Arabia here is shown\) are.](https://preview.redd.it/1elyihr7df761.jpg?width=1719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae5f5678419ec3151e87b7943386c5d915c11d7e)

Conclusions:

1. Soybean production in the American Heartland (which extends up into Canada) will increase and become more lucrative. Soybean production in Argentina will as well, but for reasons beyond the scope of this post, I don't believe Brazil will (geography, infrastructure - look at this [traffic jam](https://www.aboutbrasil.com/modules/images/224.jpg) during harvest season).
2. The value of all agricultural exports will increase, as we're on the brink of worldwide food shortages, accelerated and exacerbated by climate change. 
3. China and India (2/5 top producers) cannot meet this demand as the former is already short on arable land and the latter only does well enough to feed its domestic population. 
4. The increased demand from the western world for soy products will increase as the Soyboys continue to make up a larger and larger part of the overall demographic.   


What can you do:

1. Buy an ETF like [SOYB](https://teucrium.com/etfs/soyb) (I'm literally not kidding, this is the ~~Soyboy~~  Teucrium Soybean Fund ETF).
2. Trade soybean [futures](https://etfdb.com/etfs/commodity/soybeans/).
3. Invest in anything surrounding the soybean industry. 
4. Invest in lands or industries in countries that will benefit from soy in the future. My personal bet is on Argentina. Maybe you can move to the [Rio de la Plata](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/high-angle-view-of-montevideos-coastline-puertito-del-buceo-pocitos-picture-id1028515608?s=2048x2048).

GME 🚀 I am so tired of all you retards posting shit about AAPL and all these other small dick fucking plays. We have one purpose and that's it. Remember when your wife put on her sluttiest outfit last night before going out with her friend from work? She told you your only purpose was to have ice packs ready for her thighs and bandaids for the scrapes on her knees? Yeah, well this is even more direct and serious. 

You have one purpose in this life. Fuck Melvin Capital and his bitch ass boys so hard that when they burp next Christmas, it smells like fresh semen. What that means for you paint sniffing crayon eaters is simple. 

**DUMP EVERY CENT FROM YOUR FAST FOOD JOBS AND CHRISTMAS MONEY INTO GME**

Guess who isn't gonna have a happy new year? Yeah you guessed right, 🌈. FUCKING. 🐻's. This next week we are gonna shake the world to it's fucking core with the same sheer, absolute will of a retard jumping out of a moving car to follow the golden arches of McDonalds. Nothing can get in our way. All the wet toilet paper cucks sold already, (ice packs and bandaids aren't cheap) and we know Christmas stamina makes their wives boyfriends even stronger. We can now impose some real autistic willpower into these shorter's souls. 

**THE ONLY PLACE TO YOLO** 

GME. THATS FUCKING IT. I just refilled the thrusters with more astroglide and although it's slippery, we are gonna squeeze like VW out of this atmosphere. Here is some emojis for the braindead fucks that haven't figured out how to use a voice over software and have this shit read out loud for them. Even blind people figured that out, but you retards just stare at the text with a finger in your nose sucking down a bottle of glue hoping for a Christmas miracle.

Stop being so dense and retarded. Calls dated after Q1, everything else dickrammed into shares. I can't fucking read another post with some cuck crying about his weekly OTM calls expiring worthless, when he is actually supposed to be in his chair watching his wife get porked by her coworkers. Stop trying to tear your relationships apart and give them the attention they deserve. If your phone is out, you should be recording, not bitching about your stupid FD's. 

This shit is official. 

**SHARES AND CALLS DATED AFTER Q1**

Everyone that actually wants to make money instead of lose it, will already know this. 

Now go put your fucking medical helmets on, your mouth guards, anti-scratch gloves and prepare for the war of the fucking decade. If you have access to margin, credit cards, and student loans, don't be a degenerate retard who goes and buys weekly calls. Spend at least 200% of your net worth on shares and maybe you can go be someone's wife's boyfriend. Is that clear? The shorters are sweating and it's dripping down their ass crack. Take advantage of it and stop being a cock gobbler. 

TL;DR for you retards with the attention span of a paper bag. GME shares make rocket shoot up. With lube, rocket so slippery that it squeezes out of atmosphere. Literally can't do tit's up. Tit's up bad, GME squeeze up, good. 

GME blasting to the massive cock of Orion's belt.

Is that enough fucking rockets? It's not supposed to be a goddamn picture book, but I hope it got at least one of your 3 synapses fired up.

Edit 1: For the 10 of you that can actually read. Here is something I saw /u/Woodyoureally comment in another post. "The SEC considers company directors, officials, or any individual with a stake of 10% or more in the company to be corporate insiders."

"Insiders are prevented from buying and selling their company stock within a six-month period; therefore, insiders buy stock when they feel the company will perform well over the long-term."

Is that a guarantee that RC's 13% can't be sold during the impending squeeze? Poor GME shorters. They will only be able to buy from us diamond handed retards and RH is going to crash when the squeeze starts anyways.

 Just answer the question, even if you know you've gone full-retard._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Christmas gains+position update road to 1 million BIDU+GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Merry Christmas retards! My advice for next year: if you yolo at least do it from a brokerage that gives you the ability to sell after-hours. I forgot to sell before 1pm pst and watched the stock price drop and a bunch a idiot shorts having a party _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Christmas is best spent celebrating the greatest bull market in human history. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VALE - hold or dump for GME? I know, it sounds retarded, but the question is actually - is there more steam in steel plays right now, as none of them made any progress last week? 

Great, steel futures are up yadayada and the steel bulls are gonna tell you a nice story, but is this steel price growth sustanainable for these stocks to make more good gains? Besides, things like MT, VALE, X, STLD are already in billions or tens of billions in Mkt Cap, with these inflated prices. Schnitzer is the only one that’s below 1B and still making modest gains.

So, I’m considering dumping all my VALE shares to add to my GME shares. That is all. Tell me why this is a stupid idea.

EDIT: I already do hold GME shares, not much, some 300. No calls.

More EDITs: I like the idea of dumping VALE shares for some super cheap VALE Jan 22 leaps, and adding the rest into GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Followed WKHS since summer 2019. Decided to throw the kitchen sink at it when COVID hit. Looking forward to hitting the BIG "M" sometime soon after recently learning about options trading. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
