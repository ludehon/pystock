 Unclaimed Property  

Hello [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)stocks!!

So I recently found out you can log into [unclaimed.org](https://unclaimed.org/) and pick a state you lived in to see if you have any unclaimed property. Well it looks like I had some unsold shares of a company that I'm guess may or may not have gone under since I've moved from that state. I lived there in 2009, went overseas for about a decade and recently came back to the U.S. and now live in a different state. Anyways... On to the question:

On the unclaimed property form it lists company/security name as: Merrill Lynch Gra/Matech Corp

Now back in the early 2000's I bought a bunch of shares from Matech Corp, they were developing a technology to find hairline fractures and damages in bridges with the hopes of making a bunch of $$. But now when google search them, I can't find anything recent about them; nor their ticker symbol.

I guess I'm wondering what could happen? Could I owe money? If the company went bankrupt would they just cut me a check for the losses? Any insight would be appreciated, thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Call options, worth without exercising? Never traded options before but got a question for anyone who can answer. If I buy come call options even if I wouldn't have money to be able to exercise said call in the event the prices did go up is it still even worth it? Or am I better off buying shares i could afford ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bear Case for Unity Software $U I've seen a lot of positive posts in here about Unity and as someone who uses the technology professionally and isn't a fan, I decided to take a deeper dive into it. I'm very bearish on their prospects but I'd love to hear some opinions from the other side of the argument of course.

**The Product**

Unity's 2 main products are the game engine itself, as well as the ad integration within the engine. I don't personally work with the ad integration and have never heard a bad word said about it so I can't speak poorly towards it. The engine itself, however, is a bit of a mess. I've used the engine for 7 years in education and the workplace, and the quality from the point of view of it being a tool has steadily declined. The games that can be created with it are better but the tooling behind them is rushed through, left unfinished and poorly documented and is getting worse. I won't get into too many details but render pipelines, shader graphs and the jobs system are recent examples of features that have great potential but were either seemingly abandoned halfway through, of poor quality compared to competing solutions, or poorly documented.

**Their Revenue Streams**

Unity gets it's revenue from 3 main streams. 

62% - Operate Solutions: Monetisation of content, primarily ad revenue.

29% - Create Solutions: License keys, subscriptions and consulting

9% - Strategic partnerships and other: This includes their cut of asset store sales

Unity's ad revenue comes primarily from mobile games, and this is where it's biggest problem lies. The company is making a relatively staggering loss of $282M on revenue of $772M. Sales and marketing account for $216M of this loss, but that doesn't make up the shortfall. Their R&D costs totalled $403M but if they're looking to keep their core market as well as expand into new markets, this R&D is badly needed.

The Operate Solutions section poses a major problem. [Over 50% of new mobile games are made with Unity](https://unity.com/solutions/mobile#:~:text=More%20than%2050%25%20of%20all%20new%20mobile%20games%20are%20created%20in%20Unity&text=A%20comprehensive%20mobile%2Dgame%20solution,to%20players%20around%20the%20world.) and it's used for 53% of the top 1,000 mobile games. They already provide the engine for 50% of all mobile games, meaning they don't have a huge amount of room to grow their revenue in that area without changing their pricing structure.

Their Create Solutions Revenue comes primarily from users purchasing license keys and subscriptions for the engine. Companies earning over $100,000 in their previous calendar year or wishing to remove the splash screen from their game have to purchase the Plus subscription at $399/yr per seat. Those earning over $200,000 have to use Pro or Enterprise at $1,800/yr and $2400/yr respectively per seat. This presents another problem in that the revenue ceiling with this pricing structure is very low.

**Growth Prospects**

I think that given their current revenue streams, growth prospects are extremely limited. Even if their Operate Solutions income were to double, in a market segment where their tech is already used in over half the products, that income would only total $1.25B in revenue. About 262,000 people work in games in the US, and the US makes up about [56% of global games employement](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/), giving us a crude estimate for 470,000 game developers worldwide. Ignoring how larger companies will always use their own engines. If we assume 75% of those people work in production and require a license and give Unity an incredibly generous market share of 40%, that gives them a total revenue from subscriptions of $310M. 

The examples above are ridiculously optimistic examples of potential revenue from current streams and only total $1.501B, which equates to sales per share of just $5.54. The games industry is rapidly growing but not quickly enough for Unity's current revenue streams to ever generate a profit from what I can see, let alone one that justifies their current market cap.

**The Competition**

I haven't mentioned them up to this point but their competition is strong. Beyond proprietary engines used by larger studios is Epic Games' Unreal Engine. Epic Games is privately owned so the comparison isn't precise, but has a valuation half that of Unity's, despite posting 2020 revenues of $5B and 2019 profits of $730M. If we consider Epic Games to be a good measuring stick, Unity's valuation is completely absurd.

Unreal Engine is generally considered a better engine to work with in commercial settings and is used on a large number of successful games from large studios, including by AAA studios in which Unity struggles to find any foothold. Unity is a good engine in very small teams and for education but those two avenues can only bring in so much money. Beyond that, Epic Games' pricing structure allows for significantly higher revenues from successful products, charging a simple 5% of revenue on products with over $1 million in revenue. To give an example of how big a difference this can make, take Pokemon Go. Niantic has 750 employees on LinkedIn. If 2/3 of these people require a Unity Enterprise license for their work, they pay about $1.2M a year to Unity for the license, despite having made [lifetime revenue for over $4 billion](https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020). Using Unreal Engines pricing structure would have netted $200 million in revenue.

**Caveats**

There are a couple of caveats to this of course. A revamped pricing model, more similar to Unreal Engine's would give me a lot more hope for the company's prospects, although Unity would still need to bring in significantly more big companies to really profit from that approach. I have very strong doubts the company will ever reach profitability with their current pricing. 

They are also spending a lot on R&D. From one developer's perspective, this hasn't produced much of value for me but if this changes in the near future, that may encourage larger companies to get on board.

Additionally, there are opportunities to be had outside of games. Construction, AR and simulation to name a few. I won't do a deep dive there as I simply don't have a high level of knowledge in those areas but I think there are either better existing solutions or limited commercial applications in those areas that limit revenue opportunities. I may be missing something big there however due to my limited knowledge.

I'd love to hear others thoughts on this as well as any potential bullish cases I might have missed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon stock split?

And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.  

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon. 

“Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality. 

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, "We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020." Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. 

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI) and SpartanNash (SPTN). 

The question is if this success in grocery is short lived due to the pandemic, or will this continue once it is behind us.

I want to start off by saying that I am by no means an expert; investing in gold mining companies is not the same as actually buying gold. When I trace the 10yr chart of AGI's stock price it fairly closely matches the 10yr price of gold's spot price, same as with many other gold mining companies. As of around 2020 the stock price graph of AGI begins to separate from the actual price of gold and the price of its competitors. Other gold mining stocks have been rising sharply since 2020 as well as the actual price of gold. This company in the fourth quarter of 2020 for example had a profit of 88 million dollars. IMO this stock is undervalued unless I am missing something. I found an article written by simply wallstreet (I don't know how credible the source is) saying the stock could be nearly 50% undervalued (link to article below). My question is why is there a difference in the share price of this stock and other gold mining stocks and or the price of gold itself.

**Cathie likes the stock.**

ARK's strategy is to invest in companies who can yield at least 15% growth annually for 5 years. If it doesn't double in 5 years, she cuts it. The fact that ARK is investing this early tells me that even though there isn't a merger date set, this one is sure to go through. This doesn't even consider the fact that this could be a major part of ARKX when it hits in a month. Currently it's a growing part of ARKQ.

The company is solid. It's a growing company in an explosive, disruptive sector. They want cash to invest in R&D for EVTOL. I tend to follow Cathie and this seems to have a lot of upside in the near future. I’d love to hear what everyone thinks of this company’s future and the future of the industry. Is it really UberAir?

*NIO* is a chinese electric vehicle company founded in Nov 2014 had its 1.8 Billion dollar IPO in the U.S. on September 12, 2018. NIO is traded as an ADR (american depository receipt), which is a negotiable security representing an investment in a foreign company, has only been around for 7 years, starting at $9 during its IPO and rising to $56.67 as of 2/5/2021.

It is currently the **fifth largest car company by market cap** under Tesla and Toyota, beating the likes of GM, BMW and Daimler. This is incredible considering they have only been trading in the US for 3 years, and the troubles they have gone through since then.

Pros:

* Low short interest, per yahoo finance.
* Incredibly quarterly sales growth, since having a down quarter in Mar 2020 (Q1). Since then, they have increased 166% and 24.69% QoQ from Q2 to Q3 2020.
* Strong Dec 2020 sales, and deliveries of EV cars increasing 121% YoY.
* Beating analyst estimates in Q3 2020 showing a positive turnaround and forward outlook for the company.
* Unique approach to batteries, all their products use the same battery type and have invested into BaaS.
* New records high quarterly deliveries in 2020 Q3, representing 100% You growth.
* Launch of the 100kWh battery pack, and a focus on providing users with a a choice of purchasing the pack or renting one for a monthly fee.
* Back to back positive cash flow, with vehicle margins increased to 14.5%.
* Battery swap stations are faster than charging stations.
* Delivered 12k ES8/ES6/ES6s/Ec6s in Q3 2020, with 16-17k more expected in Q4 2020.

Cons:

* \-12.1% gross margin in 2019 Q3, rising to 12.9% in 2020 Q3.
* 10/6/2 Buy/Sell/Hold ratings and overweight consensus, per WSJ.
* EPS has been decreasing, while net income was flat for Q3 2020.
* State owned rivals such as Li, Xpeng, and Tesla could pose serious risks.
* They needed a US $1 billion bailout in 2020 because they couldn’t sell their vehicles and even missed payroll in Feb 2020, almost going bankrupt.
* High capital investment industry, with low room for error.
* Overvalued, as investors chase the ‘next Tesla’.

Conclusion

Nio is currently being described as the ‘next Tesla’, though it is 1/10 of Tesla’s market cap. Though Tesla is considered as over-valued by analysts, I believe that Nio has not been profitable long enough to match the level of enthusiasm that investors feel for Tesla. [Nio has had a rocky start, and a recent dip (as of 2/5/2021) as some investors have chosen to cash in on their investments. ](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/december-figures-keep-both-sides-nio-stock-case/)

Take a look at the vehicle margins in Q3 2020 (14.5%) which is a huge turn around from almost going bankrupt in 2020, and not being able to pay for payroll in Feb 2020. They have had an incredible gain in gross profit as well, seeing positive growth from the cash injection they had in 2020. They are also projecting higher estimates for 2020 Q4 (expected in Mar 9, 2021) for vehicle deliveries, while providing unique services that decouple the user from having to go to a charge station.

Tesla had toyed with the idea of swappable battery packs as well, but have never actually deployed them as they re-invested in their supercharger network. Nio has already established a network of swappable battery stations in China, and is actually able to lower the prices of its EV lineup by offering customers the option of renting a battery pack via a subscription model.

This is a turning point, and a make or break moment for Nio. Today I heard they announced the intention to sell vehicles in the U.S. I think they could be huge if they can continue to deliver on vehicles, and I am extremely bullish on it.

I don't have time to do a full DD but here are some thoughts:

**KOPN (Kopin Corporation)** is best known for its display devices for mobile electronics. The company was founded by engineers from MIT and currently holds hundreds of patents that are applicable to **Augmented Reality**. Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets. 

In the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential. 

**I believe that Kopin is set to be a breakout company in the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) sectors.** Kopin's VR technology is already a market leader. Their OLED microdisplays have the highest frame rates and resolution rates with the smallest sizes and lowest power consumption. They also have a voice-activated microchip technology called Whisper, which they claim is 200% better than other voice-recognition chips in the market. Cathie Woods recently talked about AR/VR in her 2021 Big Ideas presentation, which I think is another solid sign for KOPN.

**I also believe that Kopin will partner with Apple.** Kopin has worked with Google Glass and Microsoft. Based on Patent filings, Apple has been exploring AR/VR for at least ten years. In January 2021, Dan Riccio, the former Apple Hardware Engineering Chief, transitioned to a new role overseeing Apple's work on developing an AR/VR headset. Apple is said to be working on multiple prototypes for AR/VR headsets, and is expected to first launch an "Apple glasses" product by 2022. Bloomberg has also reported that Apple plans to launch an AR headset similar to FaceBook's Oculus Quest. Kopin has a long history of research, product success, and high-level partnerships that I think would make it a great candidate to partner with Apple (if they haven't already, which I think it's likely that they have and it's just not public information). 

As u/madmattmen mentioned, KOPN has been a sleeping giant this past year. Their stock is up almost 2000% this past year, with huge accumulation occurring over the past few months alone. Their Earnings Report was set for 3/9, but they just moved it up a week to 3/2 which suggests good news (they are expected to report their strongest quarter yet). I am extremely bullish on KOPN, and I'm setting my price target at $20 by end-of-year.

Caveat: I am not a professional, do your own DD, this is not advice, and I bought 50 shares today + plan to buy more with my next paycheck._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Investment Strategies/ideas post-memestock? So yeah wanted some informations and to share my quite disapointing adventure in investing. Started last year to invest "for fun" since the interest rate at banks are insultingly low and felt I was loosing money by not investing. Just to see how it goes at first, I put my money mostly in ETF and safe stock (and small quantity of stock too). I made like 100$ in 3-4month with a 1000$ investment. Now the meme stock part, I managed to buy 1 share of GME at 40$, but didn't want to sell anything to buy more, regreted it. I then added 2000 to my account, it takes 3 days to clear, the peak is coming and I still don't have my funds, FOMO hard, buy 1 share around 230, add some AMC and BB to the pile, sell that share around 330, still decide to buy more after that because it's the "dip". Well, If I sold february 1 I could had still made like 500$, but didn't, I bought more GME because my smooth brain said YOLO and we were going to the moon right? Immediately regret it the next day, Paper handed (another cool kid term) and didn't want to lose anymore money, sold all the meme stock at a lost, except BB at a smalll profit in the following days. Now I'm back to square one with -300$ to my original funds. Since I was mad and tired of loosing I immediatly tried to buy some stock that seemed to be a bargain, bought lower than it was a few weeks ago and when it was climbing back up from a dip, since then it's been dipping again, loosing me even more money, but i'm still confident it will rise back up over a few months.

Now, for my question, what should/could be my best strategies to regain my losses asap (if possible), because after that I plan on putting back 90% in etf and only keep a small percentage to gamble, I learned my lesson and I don't think i'm made to play with "volatile stock". It hits even harder to know that I could've already remade my losses by putting money last week in weed stock that's exploding now (I hesitated between weed and that other stock i'm currently losing money on), but I feel it's too late for that now. Also was thinking of taking everything out of the stock market and put it in bit coin instead, i actually made around 1500-2000$ in 2020 with them so yeahh, at this point I feel it's easier there lol, but I would wait for a dip from the all time highs of right now.

TL;DR : was "winning" a little before my smooth brain decided to get on the hype train of memestock, lost money, now I wants to be a "safe" investor.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Realizing you have won and when you have lost Hello guys,

As the title says, I wanted to ask you how do you deal with profits and losses, in particular how do you know when you have 'won' or 'lost' a trade. 

Especially in a bullish market like the one that is going on, how you decide that a trade you have made gave you enough profits and that you should take your gains? I know that a normal answer would be 'Do your DD and decide what is the price target' but even after that how do you just forget about that trade without going back thinking 'Oh damn, I could have made more'?

The same goes for losses._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anything I should look out for with APHA?  Hey all,

Small money new investor here. Started literally a week before the whole GME debacle, I went all-in for a few shares when it was around $80 and while I ultimately held too long I did get a nice return. So for now I've got that "house money" feeling so I'm going to keep exploring and learning about the market.

When I first started I saw a recommendation for APHA and bought a couple shares. For the brief time I held it performed well, so I bought back in after cashing out GME and obviously have been very happy with the results so far. Currently holding 14 shares at $15.88. I've since read up more and have a basic understanding of the merger with Tilray and the potential results of that.

At this point it seems pretty unlikely it'll be a losing play, but I guess I'm wondering what to look out for to maximize profits here. I've heard people mention that Tilray has a lot of debt. Should I be worried about a steep decline post-merge or anything like that or do people see this is a long-term play?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some of your short-term and mid-term plays?

I've never traded options before, and Im messing around on a trial account on SaxoTrader.

I've set up a put for a stock well known at the moment, which has tanked this last week, with a strike price of 50. Its currently at 50.23.

However, the trader says all prices are delayed by 15 minutes. Is this normal?

What happens if the price drops down below 50 in those 15 minutes and back up? Does it just mean I can only trade on those 15 minute intervals?

I hope this makes sense :/

there's hardly any options platforms open in the UK so i'm limited and trying to find a decent broker._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which way should I go as of right now pertaining to these stocks? I know the readers here are tired of hearing about the memestocks and users from WSB bet if anyone here would like to help me I would greatly appreciate it.

Now I'm not as down bad as some other people are in their memestock (GME bought 1 @ 315 and another at @ 292) Which has be around a loss of $600. I also have $AMC I have 10 shares at an average price of $15. I have BB at 3 shares $16 avg cost and NOK at 2 shares at $10 avg cost.

I know these aren't big losses and the whole GME thing has gotten me to want to learn more about stocks in the future but my main goal is trying to recoup the losses I have. I have around $100 in buying power so I don't know if it would be wise to buy shares of gamestop while they are cheap to bring my average price down or use that $100 and invest in other small stocks where I could potentially make the \~$800 dollars I lost back.

I also wanted to know how exactly people find stocks to invest in, like what are the perentages and numbers people look at in a company that makes them eager to invest in it.

WTF AM I MISSING???_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FMS - undervalued COVID play on Kidney Care Dialysis company Open to feedback and counter arguments. 

**Starting Point**

- Researchers are warning that COVID19 will accelerate the global growth of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) over a long period of time. That’s because the disease damages the kidney’s much in the same way it damages the lungs. The exact number of patients who will develop CKD after contracting COVID is unknown but could be as high as 8% of total patients (combining 25% of AKI occurrences in [NIH study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7598516/) with 35% prevalence of [Mt. Sinai study](https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2020/mount-sinai-researchers-warn-increase-in-chronic-kidney-disease-linked-to-covid19-pr)).  Regardless of the exact figures, even when considering increased mortality of COVID for patients with preexisting CKD, let’s move forward with the premise that COVID will increase the growth of CKD patients globally.

**TAM**

- According to [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/dialysis-market-102367), “The global dialysis market size was $90.33 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 177.56 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period.”

- A quick google search will produce many equivalent sources. You’ll also see that COVID-aside the TAM for CKD was already projected to grow at astonishing rates globally due to increased prevalence of diabetes resulting in part from the spread unhealthy western diets and an increased sedentary lifestyle. But for the purposes of this post, let’s use the forecast from FBI above.

**The Investment**
- Fresenius Medical Care [FMS] - This German-based company is one of the world’s leading providers of products and services for people with kidney failure.

**The Catalyst**
- Overreaction to a recent news release introduces opportunity for value play: 
- On February 01, FMS issued a [press release](https://www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/news/preliminary-announcement-2021targets/) stating that, “accelerated COVID-19 related excess mortality of dialysis patients and continued related higher direct costs [will] negatively affect 2021 business development.” More specifically, “Based on the currently available information and status of analysis, revenue growth of up to mid-single digits and assumes net income before potential restructuring measures to decline by up to 25 percent.”
 
- In summary, they are being hit hard in the short term by COVID. CKD patients are dying at much higher rates than the baseline, and they have significantly higher operating costs due to precautionary measures. However, these are temporary setbacks. Remember, the research suggests that COVID will **increase** the number of CKD patients over time **even when considering the increased mortality rate.** FMS concludes, “Fresenius Medical Care’s mid-term targets until 2025 as defined in October 2020, remain unchanged.”
 
- The share price dropped from roughly $42 to about $34 or approximately 20%. I argue that the market is overreacting to the short-term impact of COVID on FMS and thus presenting a long term opportunity.
 
**Basic Financial Picture**
 
- First, a review of their financial situation suggests steady and stable growth across the past several years. Nothing really grabs my attention. They have health cash flow. Manageable debt. Revenue growth. Stable margins. I’ll paste some of the basic numbers below and then dive into my projections.
 
FMS basic financial numbers (in millions) 
 
In millions | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- 
Revenue | 19573 | 19541 | 20100 | 17910 | 16737
Net Income | 1343 | 2340 | 1446 | 1243 | 1029
EPS | 2.22 | 3.81 | 2.35 | 2.03 | 1.69
Cash on Hand | 1128 | 2533 | 1105 | 747 | 549
Total Assets | 36886 | 30992 | 27155 | 26933 | 25365
Total Liabilities | 22072 | 15754 | 14916 | 15476 | 14869
Net Cash Flow | -1274 | 1378 | 304 | 197 | -84
Free Cash Flow per Share | 0.65 | -0.45 | 0.64 | 0.16 | 0.13
Debt/Equity Ratio | 0.68 | 0.58 | 0.68 | 0.74 | 0.82
Net Profit Margin | 6.86 | 11.98 | 7.2 | 6.94 | 6.15
Return on Investment | 7.31 | 12.4 | 9.35 | 8.3 | 7.16
 
**My Napkin Math**
- Let’s calculate global market share that FMS captured for treatment of CKD patients in 2019. (17.48B EURO X 1.12 USD) / 90.33 TAM) = 21.6%.
- Net income 2019 was $1.34B
- Assuming market share is stable, projected to 2027, 21.6% of the $177.56 billion TAM is $38.35 billion revenue.
- Median net profit margin going back through 2018 – 7.5%
- Applying this median net profit margin to the 2027 revenue estimate gives us a net income 2027 estimate of $2.88B. Which means you could conservatively say that FMS net income will double by 2027.
- Current price is 34.21 with P/E ratio of 12.59
- Median P/E ratio over the past 10 years is 17.6.
- Let’s assume current P/E ratio is maintained. That puts 2027 price target at $73.52.
- Let’s assume return to median P/E ratio of 17.6. That puts 2027 price target at $102.77
- Let’s assume high P/E ratio of 23.96 that occurred in 2016. That puts 2027 price target at $139.90
- **That’s a potential 114% - 308% gain over 6 years** on share price alone. Pretty good considering FMS really only needs to scale their current operations enough to maintain their market share and margin. That’s a fairly low bar for a company that is at the top of the field and growing. And to put icing on the cake, they have a growing dividend which current sits at a ~2% yield.

**Headwinds**
- While researchers think COVID19 will increase the number of CKD patients over a long period of time, it’s also apparent that patients with pre-existing kidney disorders have a higher COVID19 mortality rate than their peers without kidney disease. That means that demand might suffer in the short-term for companies who are currently providing dialysis services. Furthermore, as with many businesses, there are increased COVID19-related costs for kidney care providers – especially those who specialize in outpatient kidney care clinics as opposed to at home services as they need to take extra precaution with PPE and immune compromised patients.
- The largest headwind in my opinion is the movement from dialysis clinics to home dialysis. FMS primarily providers in clinic dialysis services and our model falls apart if FMS loses market share. However, FMS is well aware of the transformation to home dialysis, as this is not a new development, and they are shifting their business model to provide more of these services. Moreover, the initiative to move to home dialysis, while aggressive, has been ongoing since the Obama years and FMS revenue has not seen a dramatic hit. Still, to decrease this risk, I’m hedging against FMS’s failure to adapt by also going long on OM, a young company that produces the best home dialysis machines on the market.  
 
**Other companies**
- Onset Medical [OM] – Mentioned above. Disruptive tech. New company. Sky high valuation but useful as a hedge against FMS losing market share.
- Davita Kidney Care [DVA] – FMS’s largest US competitor. I consider them a strong long-term investment as well, as they are moving to home dialysis model faster and they have a slightly better reputation than FMS in terms of quality, but their valuation is much higher at the moment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What long term stocks are you planning on investing in for a year or even decades?

As u/Fairytalezz mentioned: Today 2/9/2021 BB announced its [QNX Black channel Communications Technology](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/black-channel) will be used in [Motional’s](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-motional-the-hyundai-motor-group-and-aptiv-autonomous-driving-joint-venture-unveils-new-identity-301109904.html) next generation driverless vehicles. 

Motional is backed by Hyundai, and coincidentally Hyundai just announced they will NOT be partnering with Apple for a self driving car. Could it be because they got meaningful progress on their own assets and don’t need Apple? Yes, this is just my speculation, but it’s big fucking news for BB.

The technology enables Motional to provide safe data communication exchange within the vehicles safety system. Motional is expected to roll out self driving cars by 2023.

Here is another [article](https://techspective.net/2021/02/01/qualcomm-google-and-blackberry-the-companies-revolutionizing-the-automobile/) that highlights why BB could be picked up by other EV plays. The highlight being:

“Blackberry has the most secure high-volume operating system on the planet, with QNX, which is being used on car operations... The Blackberry-Google part of this effort is rather interesting because while each potentially plays on both the control and the car’s entertainment side, they are best when working together. QNX leads with security and experience with embedded systems. Still, it doesn’t have much in terms of app support, which is a plus when you talk about the systems that drive, control, and stop the car, but a minus if you are talking about cockpit entertainment. Google’s Android platform has a ton of apps and developer support, making it less secure and more likely to get hacked, tolerable for the entertainment systems in a car but unacceptable for anything to do with car safety. Working in tandem, Working together, Blackberry secures the result, ensuring the car is reliable and safe.

BB timeline in the past 3 months: Partners with Amazon. Partners with Baidu (The Chinese Google). Partners with Motional (EV). Don’t be deterred by the fluctuation due to the panic selling from the meme stock halt, this is fucking taking off again and this time it will stick without the bullshit.

TLDR: Always do what you feel is right for yourself and only invest within your means/ risk tolerance because I am not a financial advisor. My bias opinion is pick up some BB before you miss the fucking rocket. CEO Chen even [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20) out some hints of the events to come.

Keep in mind that it has multiple sources giving BB a target price of $25-$30 that were given BEFORE the partnership with Motional. Recently Zack’s upgraded stock to a “#2 Strong buy” with a target of 29.00, and Motley also ranked it a #1 buy with a target price of 30.00. [Yahoo Finance](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-keep-143027800.html) also looking bullish. Here is also the new CEO of Amazon’s [thoughts](https://mobile.twitter.com/ajassy/status/1334191176883191808?lang=en) as well. 

Overall BB is currently up 73% just this past month and 170% the past 3 months. This is even after surviving the storm GME brought.

My strategy is to build an engine that I can debate about and get behind the wheel on. It can change over time, but it’s the critical thought process that matters at the end. It’s an engine that I want to trust to run through the good times and bad so that I am not nearly as concerned with current financial statuses at certain periods of time.
 
## Cash (15-30%)

The most critical element to my portfolio is a constant rate of cash per month. This is a “joker card”, if you will, where eventually the growing cash pile will eventually be invested when the opportunity is right and resets to 0. This holding is reserved for highly desired investment opportunities like:

- Impossible Foods
- MOD Pizza
- Reddit
- RH (don’t hurt me)

It is a pile of cash that searches for a wonderful company at a fair price. 

## Industrial (20-35%)

This element to my portfolio helps me sleep at night. The goal here is to try to capture important elements to a healthier North American industrial sector. The name of the game is **quality** and to capture broader markets. 

At the speculative level, the economic consequences of industrial automation should start to gain more impact. One could argue that the value of precision measurement will increase as machines handle more material, for example.

1. AMD - _Computing_
2. Mettler-Toledo - _Precision Scales & Analytic Instruments_
3. Ecolab - _Sanitation, water, energy, and air management_
4. Kansas City Southern - _Mexican-American Trade_
5. Rockwell Automation - _Industrial controls_

  
## Cloud Compute (45-60%)

These are my general bets on technology. I found it enormously challenging to go through the exercise of selecting a stock between industry leaders like Square & PayPal or Alphabet & Apple.

I’ve included where these companies are consequential, and why they will sustain growth as a result.

1. Pinterest - _Discovery Engine (Women driven markets)_
2. Square - _Financial Access (Underbanking solutions)_
3. Alphabet - _Internet (Distribution of education technology)_
4. Fastly - _Networking (Serverless compute)_

  
## ETFS and Watchlist (10-20%)

These holdings are held in order to track certain industry “bets” like robotics, electric grids, cyber security, gaming, semiconductors and the like. The point is to diversify almost excessively here and to observe changes over time.

I could sell it and buy more shares of a smaller stock.

I could sell and reinvest into a whole share of SPCE.

I could just let it sit there and continue to grow.

Thank you to anyone who responds!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The 5-2-3 Strategy: An Unorthodox Strategy for Investing (OC) For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.

&nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. Many would argue it was a short squeeze turned Pump and Dump but the reality is that to a certain degree it too fell into the 5-2-3 strategy. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

Hope you’ve found this interesting, I’d love some feedback and opinions on where I could do better!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice on AMC Hello r/stocks, I am hoping some of you will take pity on my moronity and provide some advice. I’ve been a fairly passive trader the last few years, mostly just buying and holding, waiting for stocks to go up and cash out at ~20% gains. 

I bought into AMC during the hype for about $1400 (yes I know I may not be the smartest) but now that value is only about $500. I’m wondering since I’ve already lost a good portion of my value there, does it make more sense to cut my losses now? Or since I’m down a decent amount, just keep holding and hope it goes back up eventually? 

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Sold and cut my loses. Probably the better choice than hoping it goes up again eventually.

EDIT 2: Major thanks to all the advice here! Much appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Serious question about BB: wth is wrong with it ? We have seen countless articles on the company.

we have read several , sometimes extremely well put together DD posts.

news outlets, analysts all seem to agree that BB is , well a sleeper so to speak. great outlook , great potential, yadda yadda.

so, why oh why is the stock price lumbering around where it is right now ?

I have one idea / assumption and 2 main reasons:

1. its reputation got hurt soo bad by their phones
2. the stock got mixed up in all those meme type shite that polluted any decent stock forum.

&#x200B;

am I missing something ?I honestly do not understand what it takes this stock to finally get the impulse it seems lacking so far.

thank you for your feedback .

looking forward to it.

I have to remindmyself why I bought it: long term hold for me. thanks. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are margin accounts only for day trading? I have experience buying and selling stock, but admittedly I have never used a margin account or WeBull, just got approved, and I want to hold 10 positions for longer than six months. Should I switch from a margin to a cash account? For easy math, let's say that I have $100 in WeBull, can I use the margin account to buy $400 worth of stock and hold it for an unlimited amount of time, or is that limited to 2x, or can I not hold margin for that long at all? If yes, is there interest on it?

Another way of asking is, I have no plans to day trade, should I just use a cash account?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fidelity: Applied to Sell Options and Now I'm Confused Hello all! 

So I have been trying to understand options and thought I had enough of a grasp to make and attempt with a small amount of money. I had an 'Individual' account with Fidelity. My other account is a Roth IRA.

So to trade options I had to apply. It asked me to select an account to apply for. I selected the 'Individual' account and applied. I think I got confused and thought you could buy/sell stocks and options out of the same account?

https://ibb.co/JzY4Srh

Can anyone tell me if you can trade stocks and options out of the same account? Thank you for the guidance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I'm getting along after GME Newbie here (started paying attention to the market during GME). I bought in right before the RH BS at 1 share for $230. It went up to $300s the next day, but I held for "hero or zero" memes (and still holding that one share as a "red" reminder not to get deep into momentum swings). $230 isn't much, and I'll eat that cost to learn that lesson and gain some clarity.

Since then, I've looked at some very volatile cannabis penny stocks and have established sell rules (if I see a 20-30% profit on my original investment, I sell). So far I've thrown just a couple thousand at some of these penny stocks and I'm very happy with how I've stuck to that rule and haven't gotten greedy. Does it mean I miss the tip-top point of the daily spike?...yeah, I've sold early, but I've also avoided big intra-day dips because of it. And I've walked away with approx 25% profit on every single purchase since GME (which I know is insane, lucky, and very much an outlier).

These are volatile and I know I've gotten lucky with some of my selections, and I know I'll probably get burned on one of these soon (which is why I'm not playing with YOLO money), but having an established sell limit and how it keeps me from swinging left and right in momentum and emotion has allowed me to sleep at night. I.e., I could've made 50-70% on "x" stock if I had just kept riding the uptick, but it was already up 30% on the day...I'm selling and making $300 on the day and walking away.

I'm not in it for long term company performance and actual investing (i.e. hoping a penny stock turns into a dollar stock over a couple weeks, month, or a year). I don't have the patience for that and I'm not in the "daily" market for long term investment. My IRAs, mutual fund of ETFs, and my 401k are my long term strategy.

But I can easily say that since GME, I've gotten stricter and tighter and held to that 25% sell limit. I made $700 today, even though I could've held and made $1000 at the right point, but I've also seen in the last few days some of those penny stocks drop back down to my original purchase price, so I'm glad I sold when I did (while others are like in the 200% range and haven't stopped upticking, but again, I can sleep at night because I held to my target.

Gotta be able to have a limit that checks your greed.

If anyone is wondering what I've played with, it is:

HITIF, NUGS, HEMP, and other various tickers in the cannabis world.

No idea how well these will perform over long-term as they are all undergoing a recent spike, but I don't want to stress over and deal with their volatility over long-term (they very well could turn into dollar stocks), but I'm just here to scratch a little gambling itch. My long-term strategy and wealth accum is not in individual stocks, so I'm not looking for a moonshot return with YOLO money. But I'm glad I can put GME behind me and have already recouped my losses and THEN SOME since jumping more into the market.

Please let me know what else I should know (any sort of advice would be soooo helpful).

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A couple weeks investing and I’ve got general questions. I avoided the meme stock but got into other long term trades and I’ve accumulated some general questions. 

I bought some Corsair last night at like $46 and it’s down to $42 per today...I’m not exactly worried about that specifically but I wonder if I should have been able to predict that drop? Are there any indicators with the stocks itself or general movements in the market I should be aware of? 

Also in terms of movements in the market are stocks cheaper end of year? It seems a lot of the major stocks I look at where extremely low compared to their current pricing? How much of that is typical market movement and how much of that is COVID related movement? If that’s even determinable. 

What are the best resources to learn options? 

Lastly, I’m trying to spread across larger established companies and a small handful of high risk low price stocks I see potential in. With the penny stocks how long do people tend to hold? Is it a %gain or a price point? I know the answer is “it depends” but what’s some specific knowledge on timing those would be appreciated.

You want to run a gel, isolate DNA/RNA, proteins, want to buy fluorescent probes, dyes, standards, want to run western blots, run mass spec sample preps, hell - do you want to buy a mass spec instrument? They have got it all. Pays a small dividend too. They are obviously struggling in the sequencing space, which is dominated by illumina. DNA synthesis also seems to be burgeoning in smaller companies such as IDT or trilink. But TMO has a good coverage for all sorts of lab needs." -u/Nosemyfart

#_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Bull case for QBTC as a Bitcoin play So I’ve been an advocate of Bitcoin (typically as a QBTC stock purchase in order to keep this post stock related) for a long time now. I fundamentally believe anyone who’s willing to put money in the traditional stock market should also be putting money in crypto. Even just a few dollars. Recently we’ve had a huge industry shift with Bitcoin becoming an institutional investment rather than a retail speculation. Cathy woods is extremely bullish on the space, the US banks have backed many blockchain technologies as valid currency payments, square is holding Bitcoin, PayPal is holding Bitcoin and classifies it as a valid currency on its site to buy, sell and transfer.... 

And as of yesterday Tesla now owns a substantial amount of Bitcoin. And being a member of the S&P 500 means that anyone holding VOO or any other similar ETF is now also invested in Bitcoin. 

With speculation that Apple will be buying Bitcoin and converting their Apple wallet into a crypto-enabled exchange I don’t see how anyone can deny this is going to be the future. If even half of the large cap companies in the US converted just a small % of their liquidity into Bitcoin then the price rises to $500,000 purely on institutional demand. 

The fact we’re coming out of one of the largest recessions in history with record levels of inflation expected is really just icing the cake as a bull case for shifting to Bitcoin. 

Crypto isn’t my area of expertise though, it’s just a sector I believe in and have had extreme success with. So I was hoping to hear from anyone who has an adequate bear case for the sector before I start allocating even more of my portfolio to it.

With increasing inflation rates and Treasury yields we can expect to see growth in financial companies. Many of these companies have been annihilated by the March Crash and are on the road to slow recovery. A sector I believe that has much potential for growth in the next couple months is real estate. House buying is at highs and inventories are low. This is an optimal time to be in the business of providing mortgages and selling homes.

This is exactly what $NYMT does. They are well diversified in that they fix rundowns, provide mortgages, and additionally operate multi-family housing. Don't let the name fool you however. The company operates in the South and South West and is not confined to New York.

Financials aren't bad. They have more stockholder equity than they have market cap. Warren Buffet has always told us to buy $1 with $.75 . With a mkt cap of 1.5b and a shareholder equity of 2.2b (Sept 2020) you are actually buying $1 with $.68. Not a bad deal.

Institutional investment is also interesting as BlackRock holds 17%. I believe Q4 Earnings while be a major catalyst for more institutional investing as they will love that sweet sweet dividend of 5.5%. They will also love buying $1 for $.68.

KIM_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CNR For both infrastructure & residential construction I used to work at this company years ago when they were still NCI and did only commercial construction and were circling the drain. They have since merged with Plygem, a residential components supplier. This means they are set for the two MAJOR construction sectors. 

I still know a few people that work there and tell me the company is really turning around as far as communication from the higher ups and getting rid of outdated ideas. They also say that they are buying up smaller competitors right and left and hiring people all the time. Also, the pandemic hasn’t really effected them since there are mostly doing computer work.

This stock was at about $5-$6 right after the merger and its doubled since then with momentum picking up more and more. I believe it’s a good buy due to residential home building on the rise, commercial builders coming back into the fold soon after pandemic, and a infrastructure bill in the future. 

However, I hear almost NOBODY ever mention this stock. Some of my buddies have made BANK on the stock since the merger. Do you think I am just bias or can anyone else give me a good reason not to invest? The more DD I do, the better it looks-this could be a PERFECT sleeper stock pick.

First post here. I am new to trading, so I will not be posting numbers and stats, just a simple discussion. I was just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on companies like goodfood, hellofresh, etc? They have really increased in popularity during the pandemic for obvious reasons. I think that it will continue to increase,  what are your thoughts?

My thought process. If you look over the past couple decades, more and more families have both parents working,  and more jobs are working longer/more obscure hours. This makes it far more difficult to find time for parents to cook. Additionally,  less and less schools offer a cooking class, the ones that do are not mandatory,  so cooking skills are on the decline. 

We've already seen a trend of companies like uber eats,  skip the dishes etc gaining much popularity due to this. However, I can see the next generation turning to things like goodfood, as the newer generations will be more health and environment conscious,  and these services are more expensive than groceries, but still cheaper than uber eats. 

I can also see these companies moving to grocery delivery.  Currently most of them give a few meals per week, but they could potentially shift to doing your whole grocery service, which would save like an hour or so a week for people.

I currently have most of my investments in the Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolio(70% of my investments are there) but Im not considering moving it all to hand picked ETFs (about 30 % of my investments are in my personal account.

The reason I like The Intelligent portfolio is I get a bit of stress thinking about what to buy, nor do I really trust my judgement, and rather just hand the task to someone I trust. 

The reason I want to move my assets somewhere else is the Intelligent Portfolio essentially matches SPY, however about 20% of the money I put into it does not go to stocks (the rest  goes to bonds and theres an 8% cash reserve).

I would appreciate some advice on some riskier ETFs that I should check out, as well as some advice on how to balance my portfolio.

I also prefer ETFs because,  as I said, I do not feel like I have great judgment on individual stocks and it gives me unwanted stress, so ETFs just help me sleep better at night.

My current investments/their representation in my portfolio in my personal account are :    
SCHX Schwab US Large Cap ETF  24%  
SCHWAB US SMALL CAP ETF  17%  
ICLN  Global Clean Energy ETF 7.8%  
SCHG Schwab Large Cap Growth   7.3%

SCHB Schwab US Broad Market ETF 4.4%

PBW Invesco Clean Energy  4.15%  
SCHF Schwab International Equity ETF 3.7%  
SMH Semiconductor ETF  3.7%  
PRNT 3D Printing ETF  2%

  Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Corsair possible explanation Hi guys, 

Let me try to give a possible explanation to the decrease of Corsair after the publication of their results. 

I won't post the results here again since there are already 10 posts of the results. Yes they were extremely positive, but I think that the main reason why the stock decreased is due to the forecast. 

**Q1:**  

"Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to dig a little bit into the outlook for 2021. I guess you guys are calling for roughly 10% growth at the midpoint. Wondering first if you could just talk about visibility and confidence behind that forecast at this point in the year? And then, Andy, I think in the prepared remarks you mentioned the first half will be stronger than the second half. I'm wondering I you can just expand on that and talk a little more about the trajectory through the year. And if at this point you think the business can still actually grow relative to last year in the back of 2021?"

" Yeah. So, a number of questions there but it's all around 2021 Look. I think the first thing is nobody knows exactly what's going to happen in the second half of 2021 yet, all right? We don't know when people are going to go back to work, when restaurants and bars will be fully open. So that's an unknown. What we do know is that the base for gamers and streamers has expanded dramatically and we do think that there's a lot of – still a lot of white space, a lot of people that have bought small – one peripheral that is anchored by more.

Now, having said that, this first half of the year we expect to be the same as most of last year. We don't see any changes. The momentum is very, very strong. People are still spending time at home buying gear. And yeah, we'll see how second half plays out. So I think we're going to have on one hand, a larger base of people want to buy gear. On the other hand, we're going to have some people spend less time at home. So, that's why we think the growth will be moderate in the second half.

If we look at Q1 last year, Q1 2020, which was of course really pre-COVID in terms of consumer spending, we grew 25% compared to Q1 2019. So that's the last growth point we have of a non-COVID environment. So we think we've got good growth ability regardless of COVID."  


**Q2:**  

"Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to the supply question Thanks for the questions. I wanted to come back to the supply question that more related to peripherals. The peripherals segment was below what we expected and I think it looks to me like probably supply constraint was the main driver there. But I'm just curious how much supply – how much you think is affected the peripherals business in the fourth quarter. And then also curious how that rolls into Q1. Andy, you said you were restocking, you know, in Q4. Do you catch up on some of that demand in Q1? Or what's the flow of supply versus demand in Q4 and Q1? Thanks."

" Yeah. So, I think that the first part of the question is a tricky one to answer because everyone was supply constrained. So – but there's no question that the market grew in gaming peripherals faster than our growth for most of the year. Now, you will notice that Q4 we actually grow over 100%. So that's when we started to catch up with the market. And the weeks on hand in the channel has definitely started to increase. I mean, some parts of last year we were down to a zero to one week. So, it's gone now out to a few weeks. Still less than we'd like to see but starting to get on top of that. So, hopefully that gives you some color."

TL:DR: Forecast for 2021 is just not as spectacular as 2020 has been. One of the reasons is due to the uncertainty of Covid. If everybody will work at the offices, the sales will decrease. However, I think that they are just very conservative._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD - How to appraise clinical literature (from perspective of a hematology clinician) While I couldn’t sleep last night, I went to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and found some hype on a drug. Therefore, I went to the study and quickly saw some flaws to the study and posted some brief thoughts. I was welcomed with a lot of upvotes on some really easy trial appraisal strategies, so I thought I would share more. Keep in mind, I know this won’t be for everyone, but I think it will help a lot of people. I’m doing this off the cuff, so I might miss something and will welcome questions.

In no particular order:

1. Outcomes: this is especially important for cancer care. What outcome was the trial trying to accomplish? Is it a surrogate outcome (like progression free survival \[PFS\]/disease free survival \[DFS\])? Or is a more meaningful like overall survival? Pros for a surrogate are that the trial is faster and saves money because you “progress” quicker than you die”. Some argue that PFS eliminates confounding of patients that switch from a study drug to the next therapy and get more survival (OS) in which case you don’t know if it is the study drug or the next therapy. Ultimately, I think from a clinician standpoint OS shows more confidence in a company and is most meaningful. However, you should know what’s a usual life course for someone with a certain case of cancer. For example, in a patient with a normal case of del13q CLL has a median OS of 110 months. You don’t need to know the mutations, but you can see running OS would just not be practical because the trial would take too long. The opposite could be said for pancreatic cancer where patients have a much poorer prognosis.
2. Comparator Arm: Especially in cancer again, this is probably the biggest problem. A lot of trials compare crappy therapies to absolutely worse comparators. You don’t need to know what the typical standard of care is for a disease is (although it wouldn’t hurt), but you do need to know if the general sentiment is that the comparator arm was trash. You can accomplish by doing a couple things: 1. Scrolling through medical Twitter for said drug. 2. Plenary Session is a great podcast by a great heme/onc doctor. If you find your therapy on there... it’s not good news. I can recommend some papers on how to sift through trials with skepticism - or maybe I can publish something on the matter :). Additionally, a lot of phase 2s are having no comparator arms and getting approved and they suck. If there is simply no comparator, that’s a negative outside of Phase 1. For me, I like Abbvie because of venetoclax. Not only is it a good drug but they are doing trials in lymphoma comparing it to the gold standard RChop. (RCHOP + venetoclax v RCHOP). Now it would be better if it wasn’t just an add-on because then you have to weight adverse events, but for the record based on how the drug works it doesn’t make sense to use it single agent (outside of myeloma t11;14)
3. Patient characteristics: Look to see if any big discrepancies in the baseline characteristics of the group. You don’t have to know everything that would negatively impact someone’s survival (I.e TP53 mutation/del17p), but if you notice that there is a big difference in one group compared to the next you can explore it deeply. The obvious ones don’t always happen, but as you get more and more familiar with the disease - you might pick up on some less obvious ones. These can also be cherry picked for you Twitter, but please don’t harass any clinicians because we use it as a way to disseminate knowledge to better treat patients, not to make money (just observe in the distance).
4. Statistics: there could be a ton here, and I’m not a statistician, but a few things:

* median versus mean: you use a median if you have a large skew of data. You use mean if the data is normally distributed (like a bell curve). If you’re noticing frequent switches for this in seemingly similar outcome analysis (i.e they initially did mean but in the post hoc they did median) there might be something fishy. There can be legitimate reasons to do this, but the take home point is to not harp on post-hoc analysis.
* immortal time bias: if you notice a patient has to have a run-in phase or has to do something before they even get the study drug - you might have immortal time bias. Additionally, if it’s a long protocol and the analysis is done as “per protocol” and not “intention to treat” you might have this. What does this mean? Well in per protocol, a patient is only counted for data analysis if they completed the protocol exactly how it was designed (in intention to treat everyone is analyzed, sometimes even if they died before they received therapy; it’s more pragmatic). Therefore, you have immortal time bias because the patient had built in overall survival from completing the intervention. Additionally, it might glean some information about how aggressive the patients tumor was if the trial was a long protocol.
* P values, confidence intervals, and power: okay this sometimes take a little experience, but I use p values usually only if I’m being lazy. Confidence intervals are going to give you a better idea of how strong data is. The more narrow a confidence interval is - the better for your outcome (I.e 0.62 - 0.68) If I have something statistically significant based on p value but the CI is huge and close to crossing 1 (I.e 0.62 - 0.99) I’m less bullish on the therapy. Both would be considered statistically significant, but im way more sure of the former. These will be in all the trials you’re looking at. P values can be gamed. The larger your power, the easier it is to get a p value statistically significant. The industry standard is 80% power. So if you start seeing 90% it’s okay, but you have to know it’s going to be easier to get to significance. Statistically significant does NOT always equal clinical significance. -Secondary endpoints: just know that if a secondary endpoint is significant that it is going to be taken with a grain of salt. Power analyses are done for primary endpoints to determine how many patients are needed. The first thing people say is “well that secondary endpoint wasn’t powered to be studied”. It’s okay to put some stock in them, but people will want more confirmation or will have hesitations.
* Exclusion Criteria/ECOG Performance Status: Trials are designed by drug companies to make their drugs look good. How do you do this? You stack the deck. A general rule of thumb is the more exclusionary a trial is the less generalizable it is to a normal patient. This seems obvious as people like you and me that walk around aren’t perfect in health, but we ultimately would be the end users. Additionally, if you exclude a potentially big cohort of people in a disease, it 1) might not be covered by insurance 2) is a flaw as they want to show better results. I run into this issue when trying to determine CAR-T therapies for someone with say CSF+ disease because those patients were excluded. There’s theories it would work, but I just don’t know (hmmm I might actually try and do a retrospective study on this!). As for Performance status, if all the patients are ECOG 0-1 then it’s not a flaw per se, but it makes it more difficult to know if it’s going to be helpful for out ECOG 2 or 3 patients! Long story short, I think a pragmatic approach with less exclusion criteria is helpful and more “real world”.

1. Real World Outcomes: some of you this might be too late. But say you’re long on a position because of a therapy, there is a growing number of researchers like myself that are “fact checking” the data by doing real world data analysis with real patients. If you stay up on it, you might find your wonder drug actually isn’t doing as hot in the real world. You simply just try and compare the outcomes from the real World data to the phase 3. This might turn your long term position into a shorter one.

Okay, that’s all I’ve got for now. There’s more, but I’m tired and this might be buried in the subreddit haha.

Change of strategy and portfolio creation.  Hi guys,

So basically I kind of hit it lucky with the GME saga and turned 1k to around 80k USD on my smaller account with CFDs (Not something I am willing to touch again). I haven't had this much money and I am 22, I have already put asside money for taxes and also have repaid some university debt as I am Spanish and we don't have biden cancelling our loans.

So I bascially have a fair amount of disposable money which I would like to invest with, I am young so I'm happy to take some risk on. I have been reading a lot about ARKs ETFs and ICLN and such over the past months, and I am quite financially informed (or at least as much as a 22 year old can be). I simply just didn't have enough to start my own portfolio.

My question to the more matured and experienced users of this sub, is what tickers do you recommend. I am bascially looking for companies with high growth potential to research in any industry. Also looking for ETFs with innovative managers, and for long term holds.

They continue to have a strong market in phones, and per the news today are now trying to move beyond that into fixed wireless gear to replace (substandard) wired broadband, and using their newest chip (peak down of 10Gb/s) to connect scattered commercial and business equipment. 

I like that they're trying to expand into the commercial heavy-duty IoT market, that their new chip makes cord-cutting more viable, that they will be having an ambitious new CEO, and that they are part of the American 6G alliance. I think that they are the bread and butter stock that will make all the sexy cloud computing stocks work in real life, in many applications. The fall on expectations of short-term capacity limitations seems like overkill, for all that they are not an "Apple go up" stock. So many stocks with good outlooks have dropped after earnings this season (look at CRSR now!) - QCOM's unexpectedly big drop makes it temporarily better value.

Any opinions on this, and on the news today? The timing certainly seems a bit forced, and I can't tell if it is unlucky timing or aimed to combat the negative news.

&#x200B;

**My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)**

**-** I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.

\- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. **The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.** Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. 

\- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.

\- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair’s products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.

The value of the option is down 10% today, when the share price is up 33%. 

When something like this happens how does the time premium from the time of buyout (June-2021) to the option expiry date (Jan-2023) get accounted for? 

What will happen to the long call options when the buyout is executed in June?

Is this line of thinking correct?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is doing a stop-loss order the proper mechanism for preventing the loss of your initial investment? Ultimate goal here is to automatically sell my shares of a given stock should they drop below a share price that would eat in to my initial investment.

So, say I put $10k in to Tesla over the course of months/years that results in an average price paid of $750. Is a stop-loss order at \~$750 of all my shares the proper way to basically get my $10k back?

(I understand it wouldn't necessarily sell at *exactly* $750 and there's a chance it'd sell for less if it were dropping quickly, but generally speaking I'm just trying to put something in place on my stock purchases that prevents a massive loss of everything.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about buying into stocks - bulk purchase or DCA over time?  I'm wondering what the best way is to enter into a few stocks in the beginning. I know DCA is overall a great method but if you are sitting on cash, should you do a bulk buy in the beginning and then DCA over time with income as it becomes available? Or would you do DCA even with the cash you have in the beginning?

My concern is if I DCA over a period of say 5 weeks during a bull run I am essentially DCAing on the way up and paying more for the same thing. So while I know over the long term (months/years) DCA is a great method, I am leaning towards bulk buying what I can afford now, then DCA after. Is this OK or a terrible idea?

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

I invested some of my capital in companies operating in the hydrogen sector in 2017. Now that most positions here have increased tenfold, I'm looking at sectors that have the same potential. Besides EVs, there is really only one sector that impresses me similarly: biotech and nanotech.

I have also focused on favouring unknown companies in order to fully exploit their potential. Conversely, this means that I do not include BioNTech or CureVac in this DD, even though they are certainly very solid companies. 

**2. penny stocks**

During my research I also came across some very interesting pennystocks, but due to the rules of the subreddit they cannot be included.

**3. the evaluation criteria**

As evaluation criteria of the companies, I then added the field in which the company is active and the techniques used by the company. 

Of course, personal impressions should not be the deciding factor. (But it must always be taken into account. A pure assessment based on the figures would be value investing, and we don't want to do value investing here, but look at the real opportunities.) But the numbers still play a role. Many of the companies in research have outlays before patents on drugs or therapies can be applied for and money can be earned. So I have also looked at the financial reports of every company I present here. According to the sector, my focus was not on whether the company is in the black or not, but whether losses have been reduced compared to the previous year's figures or not. 

#These are the stocks I like

Out of the 140 companies, I ended up buying shares in eight companies. Of these, two are a penny stock and one has a market cap of only 718M. (I can't shed more light on these because of this subs rules).

However, five interesting companies remain that I would like to present in more detail. (Sorted by their market cap)

**1. Wuxi Biologics**

WXIBF 

Market Cap: 66.763B

Wuxi Biologics is a Chinese headquartered CDMO that provides open-access, integrated technology platforms for biologics drug development. This company is not really active in one area of application, but is in some ways an all-rounder. It develops software that is used for research and cooperates with many companies to market this software but also to produce drugs for countless areas of application. In the process, the company has seven subsidiaries in China, three in the USA, two in Germany and one in Ireland. 

About the numbers:

Wuxi Biologics had revenues of $1,607B in the first half of 2019. In the first half of 2020, that increased by 21% to 1,944B USD. While profit was 671M USD in the first half of 2019 and 787.3M USD in the first half of 2020. Wuxi Biologics has made a revenue increase of 64.4% and a profit increase of 68.2% since 2014.

Conclusion:

Judging by its broad-based operations, big-name collaborations with companies worldwide and good numbers, Wuxi Biologics is a profitable company, which is very rare to find in the biotech segment. Accordingly, it is also by far the most highly valued. However, because it is such a large company that has its own software for developing new solutions in medicine, sells this software and is also involved in the production of drugs, it is difficult for me not to see growth potential here. You have a company that covers all the desirable sectors itself and is so very unique.

**2. Denali Therapeutics**

DNLI

Market Cap: 9.229B

The company focuses on the discovery and development of therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and others. Denali's approach here is to find a way to solve these diseases via genetics, pathology and cell biology. In the process, the company has found 22 drugs, four of which are currently in clinical trials. 

About the numbers:

DNLI had revenue of $8.41M in the first half of 2019, rising slightly to $9.45M in the first half of 2020. The loss per share remains steadily at a similar level. It will remain that way for the time being. Until the first therapies complete clinical trials and are approved. -$0.51 USD EPS is not unusual in the biotech sector precisely because of the horrendous research costs.

Conclusion:

DNLI has had incredible success in discovering therapeutic approaches and drugs. Even if the approval rate is only one quarter, there will be a huge potential over the years if the research success remains the same. And all of this in fields in which there are currently only partially successful therapeutic approaches.

**3. Exelixis**

EXEL

Market Cap: 7.387B

Exelixis is a company that makes genomics-based drugs for cancer. They already have an approved anti-cancer drug, Cometriq. The company is currently involved in 50 clinical trials and currently has four other anti-cancer therapies in the pipeline. The company has years of experience in the field and is listed on the S&P 400. If research in genetic engineering increases in the coming years, you have a company that is well positioned in this field. 

About the numbers: 

In the first half of 2019, revenue was $455.77M. In the first half of 2020, it was 486.38M USD. So, the company shows a small growth. What is noteworthy here is that Exelixis is in the black because of the drugs they have already approved. They were able to turn losses into profits in 2016 and have been cash flow positive ever since. 

Conclusion:

Exelixis reinvests a lot of their money back into research and still remains profitable despite large reinvestments. From the list, this company is probably the most conservative with the least risk of loss. An already profitable company that is listed on the S&P 400, but still has huge growth potential as it has a wide head start with genomics expertise.

**4. MorphoSys**

MOR

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys develops biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the Company focuses not only on drug discovery itself, but also on the technologies and intelligent development strategies themselves. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Similar to the former candidate on this list, MorphoSys is therefore a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion. 

About the numbers:

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020. 

Conclusion:

If this trend continues, MorphoSys is currently an undervalued company. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys has proprietary software that it combines with research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune diseases in addition to cancer. From the list of companies I selected, this is definitely my favorite, along with a penny stock that is not mentioned in this subreddit.

**5. NantKwest**

NK

Market Cap: 2.914B

NantKwest is a company that focuses on the treatment of cancer and a few other diseases. Of note here is that NantKwest is taking a unique approach that I have not seen in any other of the 140 biotech companies. NantKwest has built its own cell-based platform through which they can introduce genetic material into cancer cells or cells affected by infections. The company itself calls it "Natural killer cells: the quest toward a cure." It's an approach that is so impressive and, according to the clinical studies, works well. So we are talking about vaccines. Of the 13 therapeutic approaches the company has in the pipeline, 5 are in clinical trials. The cancer vaccine approach is just too interesting for me to pass over this company.

About the numbers:

NantKwest, as mentioned several times now, has negative EPS common in biotech. However, since 2016, EPS has improved from -1.47 USD to -0.7 USD in 2019. Revenue increased from $12K in the first half of 2019 to $30K in the first half of 2020. These are by far the smallest numbers and this is certainly where hope for the company's approach lies behind the large market cap.

Conclusion:

A vaccine against cancer would be incredible. NantKwest's cells are already being tested and the potential seems to be there. The company could have a promising future, but remains (at least of the companies on the list with a market cap over $1B) the riskiest investment method. Which, however, is in a company with a really great approach that I just like.

Recently this stock has been one I’ve had a close eye on. They have an activist investor on the board of directors, another board of director appointment after the activist appointment, and now the CEO is stepping down. 

My thought is Alex Denner will continue to push the board to sell the company. The last big news related to the stock was a failed drug trial last year that resulted in the laying off of 100 employees. The company is very financially well off, lean (due to extremely reduced costs), and has a good asset they can sell in Linzess to a big pharma player.

I have a Wealthsimple Trade account and am VERY new to investing. What happens to my Canadian investments when my move is finalized and I’m an EU resident? Will I still be able to trade in the North American stock market? 

Are there any options for Greek investors? My husband’s uncle who lives in Greece mentioned something about a holding company to continue investing in Canada, but I don’t really know what that means or if it’s legit.

Can I lose everything in a scenario? Sorry about the convoluted nature of this post, but I've been reading a lot online and still cannot figure out several important questions clearly.

Let's imagine I have an account on DEGIRO, Interactive Brokers, and Trading 212. So three different brokers. And I have bought stocks in companies like Tesla, Nvidia, etc. and also different ETFs (physically backed).

1. Who exactly is the lawful owner of my shares? Do I own everything and are they *in my name*?
2. What role does the stock exchange play here? For example, I can buy certain stocks from either NYSE or LSE or MIB. What difference does that make (except for the obvious things like currency of course)?
3. Is there something like bookkeeping for stocks and investments? Who holds these records? Stock exchanges? Or only brokers?
4. Are there any other ways to prove you really own the stocks you bought other than screenshots and confirmation emails from your online broker?
5. What happens if a broker goes bust, bankrupt, or just disappears one day? Or better yet, can a broker run away with your investments? What happens to my stocks? Like if I had 10 shares in 'iShares Core S&P 500', who do I go to now? To iShares? Or to the stock exchange where I bought them in the first place?
6. Can you lose your investments out of the blue without you doing anything wrong or selling them? Like, could someone confiscate them? Or could you lose access to your online broker and all of your shares forever under any circumstances? How can you protect your shares from unforeseen circumstances?

Thank you for any help_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How should I think of my long term portfolio? Hi everyone,

My retirement portfolio consist of the following holdings: - All World ETF (without Emerging markets) - AAPL - MSFT

The All World ETF is almost the same size as AAPL in terms of investment allocation. MSFT is the smallest position. That being said, AAPL is the best performing asset in my portfolio.

My long term goal is to make the All World ETF the biggest allocation, therefore I am having the current dilemma. Should I sell my AAPL and MSFT and put all the money in the ETF or should I hold up to a certain percentage?

AAPL has done well and in terms of stock value, it is the biggest in my portfolio. So I am blocked by the following decision:

1. Should i remove AAPL and MSFT all together and be 100% passive?
2. If I decide to AAPL and MSFT, when should I consider selling?
3. If selling is going to be tax inefficient, what is the good percentage to start trimming the position at?

My understanding of shorting is the seller makes a profit by buying the share back at a lower price and pocketing the difference, but something I don’t see discussed much is the time lag between the 2 events and what happens to the cash when it is in the short sellers account. Ie, is it ‘frozen’ and reserved or can the short seller immediately reinvest the proceeds from the sale, earn back their interest on the original short loan and additional profit.

Tldr; can a short seller use the proceeds from a short sale to drive a Ponzi scheme before covering (or even with no intent to ever cover)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wich companies you think are most likely to benefit from the huge investment in European railway?

after spending a lot of time reading this and other finance related subreddits, I'm quite overwhelmed by how helpful the people here actually are. So probs to you guys! I really hope you could give me advice, too.

So I'm fairly new to investing. I've read tons of information about how to read fundamentals, how to value stocks, what safe and not so safe investments are. I even have some knowledge about technical analysis due to my experience in forex trading.

Investing in the stock market though seems to always have some kind of false bottom opening up, the further I go with gathering information. It's also very opinion driven, there is no 100% objective analysis. That's why I'm asking you guys haha

My concern is about my general investment strategy, as I'm starting to work full time in a well paid job and want to invest a maximum amount of money to essentially be less and less dependant from this job. It's not a "retire early" kind of thing, I just work better knowing that my ends meet well.

1. Strategy one would be constantly investing in ETFs and or Indexfunds and forget about all that for 30 years. That has proven to be the safest bet with the well known annual return of about 7%. I have to say that this is just not me. Such a long timeframe is not planable at all in my opinion.
2. The second strategy would be spending a bit more time and picking good companies to fill a stable portfolio with promising companies. FAANG would be a good start, but of course the world is only limited to one's own mental capability of analysis.
3. Strategy number three would be a dividend portfolio. This has the potential upside of a constantly growing cashflow. To reach a significant payout one has to invest a lot of money, though.
4. The last strategy would be building a speculative portfolio. This requires a lot of time, research and balls.

To make this a bit more interesting for you, I've picked a few stocks corresponding to the strategies and are not overheated:

\- $INTC would be my choice to add to a quite stable, long term growing portfolio. I know, there are a lot of controversies about that company, but the bottom line is that they have a lot of upside potential and are almost "too big to fail". Their IoT projects are quite promising and the change of their CEO will lead them to a better place.

\- $KO Coca Cola is one of the dividend kings. I understand the businnes concept and it's a more or less safe bet, even under current pandemic circumstances. Sooner or later everything will open again and that will cause a spike in consume.

\- $GTHX would be my risky choice as I understand that it could be very undervalued. I've read quite a bit and the growth potential seems immense to me.

Or would you just wait a bit and see if all the crash prophets are right and the bubble will burst, probably still in Q1 2021?

I'm not looking for financial advice, just for your guide and educated opinions. :)

But with loads of big oil company's still being 50% away from their pre-covid price I think this is still a very good investment. As it stands right now I think we will see a dip in crude oil, the price is ramping up extremely much and is in a need of a  small correction back to 54, oil majors obviously will follow since the stock is heavily tied to the crude oil price. But after that when things have settled I think that oil majors could be a great buy for the coming 2 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question: Unity ($U) lockup expiration 2/8/2021 or 3/17/2021 ?

As of recently, I haven’t been finding many ideas. At a time when there’s arguably lots of uncertainty and a lot of damage done to a large part of the economic fabric, it’s interesting to see the S&P500 at all-time highs.

The appraised value of many businesses has long passed pre-COVID levels. The Russell 2000 which before in February was at almost 1,700 is now at over 2,200. The Dow was at 29,100 and is now at 31,150. On average, these businesses are probably worth less post-COVID as many either lost money, had little revenue, and had to use their cash on hand to cover costs, or had to issue debt to support costs.

To an observant investor though, this is no surprise. The market always undershoots or overshoots. But make no mistake, the market does this every single year. Open the stock app on your phone, close your eyes, scroll through the list of stocks, and blindly select any one stock. Then look at the 52-week high and the 52-week low, don’t be surprised to see a 50% difference.

Imagine you want to sell your house. You go to a realtor and he appraises your property. The next day you drive yourself there again and ask him to appraise your property again and he says – naturally – the value has not changed. The day after that you do the same thing, and the day after that the same thing, and very, very quickly the realtor is going to start thinking you are a little crazy. Maybe if you go a year later, he’ll say he can probably sell it for a little more/less. Now, everyone can agree that going there every day to have your house quoted is silly. But if a rational seller did find a 1/10,000,000 realtor that would actually quote you a different price every day for your house, you would know not to pay attention. Then why is this basic common sense thrown out of the window when it comes to the stock market?

I invested in a business called Vertu Motors, a company with several UK car brands. The auto dealership industry is one of the most basic industries in the world. The dealerships serve as the manufacturers’ parts and services distributor. The OEMs decentralize this part of the ‘value chain’ to not only simplify their operations but to reduce the amount of capital invested in the business – which is already huge in the manufacturing of cars. When I bought the business in August of 2020 the equity was selling for under £90 million and it had net cash of about £10 million. In other words, if you were buying the whole business you were effectively paying £80 million for the business itself.

Now that very same business I bought for £80 million pounds began in 2006 as a roll-up strategy, founded and managed by Robert Forrester, of poorly performing auto-dealerships (family-owned, etc.) and now boasts around 150 outlets. In 2019 the company did £3 billion in sales. In the auto business, around 10% will be gross profit, and 90% of gross profit represents expenses (most personnel), which leaves 10% of gross profit as profit, which translates into over £20 million in after-tax profit.

I paid £80 million for a business that did £20 million in 2019. A growing business. This is an industry where 40 years ago there were 10,000 dealerships and now there are 4,600, yet the number of new cars sold has doubled. And looking at 2019 new car sales compared to the 20-year average leading up to that, 2019 was slightly below average in terms of car sales (and average car age in Great Britain is +8 years). +£20 million is not a top-of-the-cycle number. Furthermore, this is also an industry where the ten largest dealers account for only 25% of industry revenue.

To put it in context, Pendragon paid over £500 million for Reg Vardy’s 97 dealerships. Robert Forrester used to work at the Reg Vardy, another auto-dealership that was sold in 2006. And whilst the pandemic did naturally affect Vertu, it’s still going to manage to report pre-tax profits of about £18 million. Total new car sales in 2020 were still 1.6 million versus an average of 2.4 million over the last 20 years- that’s the lowest number in a very long time.

The issues surrounding Vertu were basically Brexit and the fact that Vertu had issued significant amounts of stock until a few years ago. Now we know Brexit, one way or another will happen, despite the direction in which Brexit goes people are still going to need cars. And the stock issuance does not seem like a problem any more considering, (1) Vertu’s size and (2) their balance sheet.

I will close by saying that Vertu is a well-managed and well-positioned business in terms of the brands they carry and the share those brands have in terms of new car sales in the UK. The market has seemed to start to understand that and now appraises Vertu at an equity value of +£130 million. Even assuming they have no net cash (which they have) and that equity value equals enterprise value, this still puts the price at less than 6.5x earnings. Cheap, one might say.

Whilst academics might say that to increase returns one needs to increase risk; I must respectfully disagree. With Vertu I increased returns and decreased risk by paying a very low price. Vertu could very well sell for much, much higher prices in the future.

Hi, so I have been doing some research on what a post pandemic world would ideally look like. What really comes to mind, especially because of lockdowns, social isolation, drug abuse, etc is the overall increase in depression, and other disorders.

I think ARKG is a good investment for genetics, but I am looking to successful stage 3 trial companies, or companies that have been trying to combat depression through an innovate way. 

  
In this case, I know social media, tiktok has been huge for getting people to stay connected. And I believe companies like Clubhouse will do the same.

Thank you soo much!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which is the better stock to keep long term: Coca Cola (KO) or Verizon (VZ)? DD included Hi, investor newbie here (6 mo.). I want to trim the amount of individual stocks that I own as I believe I overdiversified my money. I own some shares in both companies and they are the least performing in my portfolio. I would like to sell one as I could use the money on a better performing stock that I have gains in (QCLN/AMD/APPL).  For what it's worth, I have a little more money invested in Verizon, than I do Coca Cola. Can someone help me figure out what's the better stock to keep between KO and VZ? After doing some DD, this is what I came up with:

**The case for selling KO:**

Coca Cola: I got into this last stock July for $48.80 and it's currently at $49.92, so there's been zero growth. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q3-2020), they haven't been doing well either. Their revenue is down 10% from a year ago and their gross profit has decreased as well. KO's balance sheet shows that their total assets have went up, but so has their debt. They have increased their total debt by 15%, which has decreased the total equity value of the company.

KO has also tripled the amount of money purchased in investments (according to their cash flow sheet), leading me to believe that they have no plans to recover immediately and are playing the long term game.

**My** **Conclusion:** The only case for keeping KO currently is because of their dividends and name recognition. The pandemic has really affected KO and will probably not recover until it's over. With that being said, other stocks are booming so it would be foolish to leave money here to trade sideways until the COVID is over.

**The case for selling VZ:**

This stock has actually been in a steep decline for several months, since hitting their ATH in early December. I'm currently in the negative in this stock, which is insane giving that the stock market set a new ATH records across the 3 major indexes. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q4-2020), their net income is down 9.6% (their revenue only increase 1% for the year).

Like KO, VZ has also increased their amount of debt, but only by 8%. Their total equity is good, as it has increased by 10% from the year prior. Their cash flow sheet shows that they've spent a lot of money in investment activities, but this is offset by the net cash they gain in the last year (10+%).

**My Conclusion:**  The case for if I should keep VZ is a conundrum for me. Their financials show growth, but the value of their stock declining sharply during a record level boom market. They have a at great dividend (4.5%) but it is not enough to cover their stocks loss in value. It is concerning and selling this stock would incur a slight loss for me. However I could regain it back quickly if I took the money wasted here and invest it into another stock (PayPal for example).

**TLDR:** I own both KO and VZ. I would like to sell one of these stocks to chase gains in growth stocks, while keeping the other long term. Which one should I keep?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some questions for a Tuesday morning I’m a complete starter to this but finding it really interesting to read up on and my future plan is to invest a modest amount slowly (say £50 a month) and build up a little portfolio to follow. 

However as I currently know so little about it I’m just going to do paper stocks for the time being. In the first instance I search google for answers but it’s not always helpful. Is there a basic subreddit for first timers like me or can I ask away here? 

Some of my questions: 

I’m using the capital app but some companies don’t seem to be on that... Biocryst for example. Why would that be? Is it something to do with it being NASDAQ? Do I need a different app if I wanted to invest in that? 

What determines how expensive a stock is. Why are some so expensive and others so cheap? It doesn’t seem to be down to the size of the company as a big company like Rolls Royce are dirt cheap and then you’ll then get stuff more expensive than Apple. One of the biggest companies in the world? 

Is there any books to read to understand all the more technical terms and jargon. Short squeeze etc.. 

How can I learn to read the graphs better? 

I don’t feel like I can invest money until I know a more. 


Apologies if this is a shit post and not appropriate for this sub_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Impact of Apple iOS14 on personalized ads (FB, SNAP, SHOP) This stratechery article [https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/](https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/) does a good job of explaining the impact of Apple iOS 14 changes to digital marketing. Apple is making it almost impossible for Facebook and other apps to get 3P conversion data i.e. did customer purchase the product on nike app after they clicked on the Nike Ad? This data is what allows advertisers to truly measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. This conversion data is fed into MachineLearning algorithms which makes the targeting better and allows Facebook and other social media companies to show relevant ads. Personalized ads also helps to keep small apps free of charge. These free apps might need to change their business model unless they can survive on non-personalized ads.

The market is pricing in the impact of this change to FB but I'm not sure if it's pricing this in to shopify, snapchat and other similar businesses that rely on personalized ads. Shopify sellers use personalized ads to drive traffic to their niche products. Going forward, it's going to become difficult for these small businesses on Shopify to acquire new users. What do you all think?

Facebook and Apple war was inevitable if you've been paying attention. Apple made a shift to services in 2015 after slow growth in hardware sales. Apple saw how much money Facebook et al were making on mobile app install ads and felt entitled to a cut of it. Facebook app has been getting bigger every year with more apps and services into Facebook like Games, Instant Articles and it has started to look like an app store. See [https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/](https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/)

Apple's own apps are exempt from this which gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors. Right now they are just blatantly privileging themselves by allowing their own apps to track users without the prompt. This is just another example of Apple holding themselves to a different standard when it comes to “privacy”.

"Facebook sells data" crowd is one of the most misinformed crowd on the internet. It is patently and obviously false to anyone who has ever advertised on Facebook. The idea that Facebook (or Google) makes money from selling data is facile and dishonest. So please avoid commenting on this thread if you're just going to say "FB/Google bad".

First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. 

Welcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. 

1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.
     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. 
  


2. DD - Due Dilligence 
      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, "Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there."
Or another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so "get in right now!!! 🚀."
NO. Just no.
I am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research "Pumping and Dumping". (Quick Answer.
Please, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  



3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.
     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. 
I know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:

BAD:
Let us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.

Set a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  



4. Educate yourself
     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.
"Any fool can know. The point is to understand." ~ Albert Einstein.

5. Handling losses. 
     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.
Learn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don't let certain things get to you. I've had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn't bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. 

Best of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come. Please feel free to post other pieces of advice as I am fairly new to the stock market as well (been roughly a year). Thanks for reading._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SNOW Snowflake reasonable price?

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides.

They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. 

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. 

Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. 

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains.

What my plan to do is take that money, put it into a Roth IRA split up evenly between a S&P 500 index fund and several ETF’s including ARKK, ARKX (upon launch) and MSOS (as I believe this industry will boom in the coming 20-30 years just in time for me to want to retire as it levels out). My main question is this: Am I at least on the right path? I am currently unemployed but once I start working I plan on investing maybe $50-$100 per month into it (again split evenly among everything in it) and as I get better jobs I do plan eventually putting up to $500 into it. 

Any thoughts or tips? I know this isn’t the typical stock post but rather a long term true investment for my future. Thanks for any advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing for a sibling of legal age What is the best way to invest for a sibling?

Facts:
* sibling is of legal age
* sibling doesn’t make enough money to even consider investing, but makes ends meet.
* sibling is married to someone who would bleed their savings dry if it existed

I initially considered investing with a trust account because it would absolve me of the tax burden when rebalancing the portfolio. I’m just worried that she may fall onto hard times before my death in which case I’d like to present her with some of the cash by liquidating as needed.

I’ve also contemplated letting her sign up for the account that I would fund and set up automatic investments through m1. My only issue is there’s no way to stop her (or her SO) from liquidating when ever they want to go fishing or buy a 36 pack. It also leaves my bank account wide open to them. Even if she were to hide it from him, they’d receive tax documents once a year for it.

My other option is to just open a secondary account and treat the investments as my own, eat the tax, and do what I want with the money when I want. Including not giving them a dime if they somehow turn their life style around.

* I’m a physician
* Patients love their medication, berotralstat (Orladeyo), because they don’t need to self-inject
* Orladeyo costs $500k a year and it’s being approved by insurance companies
* That means $BCRX undervalued by an order of 10X on this drug alone — ($121 vs. current price of $10)

A few weeks ago I read a fantastic post by u/thisismysffpcaccount: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiqh/bcrx\_the\_most\_undervalued\_stock\_in\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiqh/bcrx_the_most_undervalued_stock_in_the_market/) on $BCRX

The summary is that $BCRX created a new drug, Orladeyo, which to treat hereditary angioedema (HAE). There’s about 10,750 HAE patients in the U.S. alone.

Let me take a pause to mention that having HAE fucking sucks. People get massive swelling pretty much completely randomly, including in their airway (bad — can’t breathe) or their gut (bad — vomiting, can’t eat). The treatment fucking sucks, which is basically getting C1 inhibitor from donor blood administered IV (or more commonly fresh frozen plasma which contains C1 inhibitors). As you might imagine this is incredibly fucking disruptive to their life.

So given the fresh DD on $BCRX, I thought to myself, “the parts of my brain used for numbers are smooth because I just memorized everything like they said to in medical school, but here’s something I can get real insight into!”

I spoke with a few of my colleagues in Hematology who mentioned that they’ve had tons of patients switch from Haegarda (requires injection) and Cinryze (requires injection) to Orladeyo (just an oral pill). Patients hate self-injecting medications. Many of them are queasy, or you have to get a family member to help you, and it reminds you that you’re chronically sick. We have patients who go to the emergency room over and over again because we can’t convince them to start on new medications. All of these patients have been started on Orladeyo and have since avoided the ER, saving society tons of money.

I think it's time for an updated DD on **AUPH (Aurinia Pharmaceuticals)**. 

This is an undervalued company and I think the excellent DD that was done by u/thedudeabides86 was mostly overlooked due to the GMEania and AMCraze happening at that time.

 Also...maybe Lupus isn't as sexy as EV or gene editing but there is definitely some asymmetrical payoff potential here. 

So whats up...

**On January 22nd AUPH’s drug Voclosporin(Lupkynis) was approved by the FDA and considered the new first line of defense for Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Lupus Nephritis (LN).**

Voclosporin(Lupkynis), used to treat Lupus Nephritis, received the PDUFA approval from the FDA late on Friday Jan 22nd, around 7:23 pm. This drug is significantly superior to the only alternative treatment and reported twice the efficacy of the current standard of care. Because of this it was given priority review status by the FDA.

[https://ir.auriniapharma.com/press-releases/detail/210/fda-approves-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-lupkynis#:\~:text=](https://ir.auriniapharma.com/press-releases/detail/210/fda-approves-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-lupkynis#:~:text=)(NASDAQ%3A%20AUPH%20%2F%20TSX%3A,active%20lupus%20nephritis%20(LN).

**Real quick, what is SLE and LN?**

[LN](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/lupus-nephritis?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link#1) is inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), a severe autoimmune disease. LN can eventually lead to kidney failure which is deadly unless the patient gets a kidney transplant.

**Why is it the first line of defense?** 

Prior to Voclosporin(Lupkynis) being designated as the first line of defense, the distinction went to Benlysta(produced By GSK). Benlysta was approved for adult patients with LN just last year. However, Voclosporin(Lupkynis) has twice the efficacy, is faster acting and is oral versus injection. Current treatments require many injections over several phases requiring many in-person visits for treatment. Voclosporin(Lupkynis) can also be administered with less corticosteroids than Belysta, which reduces side effects and slightly reduces overall treatment cost, comparatively.

**Very real possibility of $4B in annual revenue from a company with a current market cap of $2B**

Around 330K people in the US suffer from SLE and 30-40% of patients diagnosed with SLE have or  will develop LN (\~120k). Voclosporin’s(Lupkynis) estimated annual treatment per patient is $65K. For an assumed total market of just under $8B. While 100% of the market is not a reasonable assumption, It seems within reason that the first line of defense treatment should take 50% of the market share or better.

**But wait there’s more,** 

* We are only looking at the US so far. Aurinia also has licensing agreements with Otsuka Pharmaceutical for the development and commercialization of Voclosporin(Lupkynis) for the EU, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, the UK, Ukraine, Belarus, Norway, and Liechtenstein. 
* The Otsuka deal came with $50M up front. (https://biopharmajournal.com/2021/02/05/aurinia-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqauph-enters-commercialization-agreement-with-otsuka-pharmaceuticals-for-voclosporin/)

* Currently listed on Nasdaq as STRONG BUY.
* Most Analysts currently giving a price target at $29.43, with high target at $35 ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/auph/analyst-research](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/auph/analyst-research))
* FDA patent extension until 2038. That’s 17 years of exclusive rights to this treatment. 
* Buy out potential is present as AUPH CEO has stated that the board would be open to a buyout and the uncomplicated structure of the company combined with the blockbuster drug would make a buy out very possible. 
* Earnings report expected date of Mar. 4th 2021

**The Devils advocate:**

* **The cost of treatment could potentially be prohibitive to persons without health insurance.** 
* **While AUPH holds quite a lot of capital it pales in comparison to bigger pharma giants like GSK and Roche.**  
* **Timing of release makes it difficult for sales reps to connect with doctors during covid restrictions.**

I went to place the new order and was given the message “Order rejected: your account has a trading restriction; only liquidating trades are accepted”. I’m not sure why this would be, because as far as I know there is no day trading limit on cash accounts (which I’m not even sure if placing it cancelling buy orders is considered day trading) and I’m curious if someone might know why this may have happened, and how long/to what extent the restriction will last.

Charlie Munger said Warren and him have 3 general rules.

1.) A business with some intrinsic characteristics that give it some durable competitive advantage.

2.) Management in place with a lot of integrity and talent

3.) Finally, no matter how wonderful it is it cannot have an infinite price, we have to have a price that makes sense

RKT checks all these boxes which really gets me thinking “is it too good to be true?”. 

RKT is a holding company that has tons of subsidiaries in mortgage lending, making it the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. so it’s definitely a company I wouldn’t mind owning in 10 years. 

I am well aware that RKT is very new to the public, and I don’t think that’s a problem, I think it’s an opportunity considering how well established it is. 

I should also point out it has reliable earnings since it’s recent IPO mid 2020, and it’s low P/E ratio is very attractive. 

I’m interested in selling puts with about 20% of my portfolio at a strike of $20. In other words I’m looking to buy it at $20/share. When factoring in premium the price in which I buy will be much lower, and the premium will be a 1% gain which in my eyes is a jackpot! I know this isn’t an options community so bear with me...

In my case, 10k in collateral for 5 contracts at around .20 per share in premium expiring next Friday. If the contracts aren’t exercised then I repeat the process and make a whole bunch of money ultimately lowering the cost basis. If I do get exercised I collect 500 shares at $19.80, far below what I believe to be its intrinsic value.
