 As soon as Sleepy Joe mentions the devils lettuce shit gonna 🚀🚀🚀🚀 trynna go 5x in a week 🙏🙏🙏 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir $35 EOW For those of you that don’t know, Palantir is having a live demo in the next week. I’ve been a data analyst for 4 years and I can tell you that any company that is specializing in big data analytics should be at the top of your watchlist. I’ve been waiting for other opportunities to invest in big data and I think Palantir is the best opportunity out right now. Here are 3 big reason:

1. ARK owns 1.9+ million shares.
2. Palantir just announced a deal with PG&E to improve the safety of California's electric grid.
3. When they show you what they can do Jan 26 at their live demo, it'll be too late to get in.



I'm not your financial advisor so do your own DD. I'm personally buying 2000 more shares for the long run plus a few Jan 29 calls.

Railway to the moon. 24x Tesla equivalent per locomotive. Fuck air freight, 40% of US freight is still moved by RAIL.

This is the company that GE transportation spun-off with back in 2019. 
WABTEC already has the ability to turn any fucking train into a hybrid even if they don't go wholesale battery electric. Their TAM is the entire fucking freight rail industry. At the cusp of an economic expansion. LETS GO.

"It takes several locomotives to power a freight train.  By putting the new battery electric locomotive in the middle of the train, between two Tier 4 locomotive, they can create an entire hybrid train.  "We actually can create a hybrid train, where the three or four other older locomotives, regardless of whose they are, what vintage of tier class they are we can actually influence their fuel efficiency with this one electric locomotive," Hamilton said." 
"He also said the power of this locomotive packed with batteries is in its infancy.  It's a 2.4 megawatt power locomotive, so just in rough terms you could think about that as the equivalent of 24 Tesla automobiles on one locomotive."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SENS DD I know this stock has run up a lot, but I really think it is worth taking a look at. 

The company? Senseonics. What do they do? Constant Glucose Monitors (CGM)

CGMs essentially read a blood sugar for a type one diabetic throughout the day which means you don't have to do a finger stick. Currently $DXCM makes the most popular CGM on the market which I currently use as I myself am a type on diabetic. 

Senseonics make a different CGM which allows for it to be implanted underneath the skin. This is different from the Dexcom CGM which sits on top of the skin. As someone who uses the Dexcom CGM let me tell you, they occasionally get ripped out and it really sucks. The implantation has to happen around every 90 days at a doctor's office. While this sounds like a pain, as a type one diabetic I have to see my endocrinologist every 90 days anyway so this shouldn't be a deal breaker. 

$SENS is moving towards broader approval for their device and today just got approval for coverage from a major insurer which is huge news. 

Generally, this company really reminds me of $TNDM before it ran up. Great technology just waiting for approval so that diabetics can start using it. 1.25M people have type one diabetes in the United States. The market for this can be huge. If the company continues to gain insurance approvals, it will skyrocket._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNDM YOLO cuz they pretty much make money printers _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Double the Brokerages, Double the Blackberry _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Remember when Citron Research was bullish on LUCKIN ($LK) and it turned out to be one of the biggest accounting/security frauds in recent history?

I ain’t Sellin’ ! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Reeeeeeeeecap of today's and recent market driving news (Jan 19, 2021) * The market performed strongly today with tech stock leading the way. Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.

* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. From fractional shares to irresponsible six figure plays near the recent top, the GME hype is so overwhelming that even WSB has quarantined them into a specific thread. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew "tool bag" Left of Citron at 9:58 AM derailed the party and sent shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the "stimulus talks are going well" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

You can read last Thursday's recap [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxf5mf/reeeeeeeeecap_of_today_and_recent_market_driving/).)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba is ready to run Alibaba is looking poised to run after a quiet breakout from its downward trend.

&#x200B;

After easing of some negative catalysts, the investor outlook on Alibaba is looking increasingly optimistic. With Jack Ma confirmed alive and well, Joe Biden's incoming inauguration, and the removal of Alibaba, Tencent, and others from potential delisting threats, the company is looking oversold in a run-up to its first earnings report since the start of its troubles in late October of last year. Alibaba's main e-commerce business remains unaffected, and the growing Chinese middle class will drive continued growth for Alibaba's main business. Continued investment into cloud computing, entertainment, and many other industries allows Alibaba to diversify its revenue and avoid the anti-monopoly crackdown of the CCP, while still remaining one of the fastest-growing large-cap companies in the fastest-growing country of the 21st century.

&#x200B;

It's clear from Alibaba's EV collaboration with state-owned SAIC Motor that the company is not going anywhere soon. They recently announced a $5-8B bond sale and upsized an existing stock buyback FROM $6b to $10b, signaling confidence in the long-term presence and health of the company. The drama surrounding the canceled Ant Group IPO has proven to be overblown, as it appears regulators will be issuing a slap on the wrist to Alibaba, and restructuring Ant Group (which BABA holds a 33% stake in) to operate more like a typical bank, as opposed to the high-risk, low-collateral consumer lending that has facilitated their rise. Alibaba's transparent cooperation and smooth conduct with regulators will probably earn them more lenient punishments, and the company's critical role in the liberalization of China's economy and their competition on the world stage will make regulators hesitant to kneecap one of their most valuable national assets.

It found a bottom at $210 and has been slowly edging upwards, trading in a range of $220-250 with strong support and resistance at both levels. The higher highs and higher lows found in the past few trading days help confirm this. This week, the ticker has consolidated around $245 for a push above $250. 

&#x200B;

Actual (not in an endearing way) retards will spout sinophobic propaganda and accusations of 'CCP shill' at anyone who proposes that Alibaba presents a buying opportunity. Smart people make money where there's money to be made. If the GMEs, BBs, and CCIVs of the world seem too speculative and risky for you to put a large stake in, Alibaba is one of the best opportunities you will ever get to invest in one of the most fundamentally solid, profitable companies in the world: large-cap stability with the growth potential of Amazon in 2014.

This shows what they held AT THE TIME they got appointed as director._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Logical bullish case for $GME to go to the moon DD Gamestop has the vast majority of the video game space.  


I have an SEO background and pulled up some of these statistics

&#x200B;

For all general related keywords for video games  


Gamestop gets 9,200,000 vistors, with 2.7m organic keywords

Bestbuy gets 25,100 vistors, with 8000 organic keywords  


Amazon gets 18,100 vistors, with 2600 organic keywords

Walmart gets 12,000 vistors, 9200 keywords  


They are been touted as going BK just because they are wasting money on employees and brick & mortar spaces.  


but they crush it, absolutely crush the eCom space  


  
The video game space is supposed to be north of $200B by 2022.  
Let's say only half of that is from online sales, which more and more is moving online now. So $100b.  


If gamestop closed all their stores that are losing money, kept the ones doing well or leave some stores for trade-ins and just went all in on eCom (assuming that is why Sir Ryan Cohen is on board)  


Gamestop being roughly half of the video game space, a $100b eCom space would make them a $50b company.  


Right now there marketcap is $2.5B!  


  
TL:DR, Gamestop dominates the ecommerce space for videogames. Ryan Cohen could just go full board eCom and make this into an actual successful business. $GME to the moon_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Happened faster than expected... $BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Guys, am nervous and my paper-handed shoulder angel is telling me to sell. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB TRUST IN JOHN CHEN TLDR: This man DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FUCKING LOSE

First, the Chen family history: Chen's family is from Wuxi, the birthplace of modern industrialization in China. During the Chinese civil war, they migrated to Hong Kong, rebuilt their lives, and moved to the U S of A. It takes some serious stuff to get through all that. Undeterred, Chen-daddy then went on to graduate from Brown University manga cum laude in electrical engineering before getting his master's from Caltech.

Here's where it gets really interesting:

**Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998. As John Gallant and Eric Knorr noted in** ***IT World***\*\*, Sybase had been a strong competitor of\*\* **Oracle**\*\*, but had become a "dead company" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had. Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an "enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'". In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that that led to the turnaround of the company into a profitable mobile device producer, valued at $6 billion in 2010.\*\*

&#x200B;

Does that sound like something similar?

BlackBerry failed to anticipate and enter the touchscreen display market for phones, instead relying on their boomer keyboards and shitty 2-bit games. As we all know, Grand Poobah Jobs came in and slapped BlackBerry around.

Until Chen-daddy showed up and realized BlackBerry had incredible people and a huge edge in cybersecurity: their shitty boomer phones were entrusted by enterprises and governments around the world. Thus began a massive pivot to software which is now going to take BlackBerry back into the pantheon of big data companies and 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Anyway, in the metro (in Paris remember?) I saw a group of teenage kids that were excited as bunch of zits can be, and where do you think they were coming from? Micromania, French brand 100% owned by GME.

My point is this: it's the weekend during a pandemic and these kids SHOP FOR GAMES AT B&M STORES.

Whether it was today on GME, last month on PLTR, or any number of the countless times a shitstain market manipulator like shitron
research has put out a totally uneducated, intentionally misleading "analysis" in order to print puts. 

Its always the same pattern. They take their put position, send out the "news" and then dump a bunch of shares on the market to make it look like anyone actually gives a fuck what they think. these people are leeches on our economy, worthless pigs who do nothing but suck money from the veins of actual investors. 

but you know who is just as responsible? our brokers. thats right, if you ask me, our actual brokers are actually MORE responsible for the manipulation that happens here. they take a tweet that gets like what, 120 retweets in a whole day? and decide, this is newsworthy, better blast it out to every single one of our customers so whenever they pull up the 
stock, they can see what Andrew Dickbreath Left has to say on the matter. 

if the SEC was worth a single fucking tax dollar, there'd be something holding brokers culpable for the "news" they advertise to their customers. THIS is where the manipulation really happens. Yeah, it starts with scam artists like left who create a brand name and pretend to be some kind of financial analyst, but without our brokers those guys are just another retard roleplaying belfort in his basement. 

All of their power comes from the fact that our own brokers are the very vehicles of their manipulation, and they just get away with it, "oh we're just providing the news, we didnt write that!"

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people.

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in.

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason "in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

&#x200B;

# Reason 3: This is a pump and dump sneaky nonsense by WSB

First, lol. The people on this sub don't have anything like that sort of buying power (especially not if we take out the people that actually believe in GameStop). More importantly, see reason #1 (especially the part about outstanding short interest).

&#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

Now here, I expect them to throw up some really shady data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), meaning it would take DAYS of trading to cover. We'll see updated numbers for Tuesday soon. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron will likely try to say was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

The point being that it is extremely, extremely likely that shorts HAVE NOT covered, and have in fact DOUBLED DOWN ON SHORTING TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE. Meanwhile, it is further likely that long buyers have locked in MORE shares so the real % short/float is higher than we would expect on the assumption that every float share is really not locked down.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's two reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 30%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 30% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these "twitter Live" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/)

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 expires after today (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did today. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank. If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell.

This is all assuming no input from Ryan Cohen or GME, so any kind of announcement or tweet would throw a wrench in my predictions. Especially if Option 2 is right and they timed it for a mid-morning peak (before the Citron livestream).

Edit 1: updated insider selling numbers after new form 3 filed Edit 2: changed reason #5 to a real reason

Edit 3 (Update): I believe Citron's strategy to be the same. However, based on the high level of negative feedback and rather aggressive commentary from this sub and others in the last day, combined with all the other above reasons, I expect a much more thorough bashing of WSB.

LGI Homes is a home builder that is (i) focused on entry level homes with an ASP of $240k, (ii) in the fastest growing markets including Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas and (iii) has the highest gross profit and EBITDA margins relative to its larger peers driven by the aggressive commission style comp structure.

This is one of the smaller public home builders at a \~$2.5bn market cap, and is positioned perfectly for the trends the housing market will see over the near and long-term. Everyone and their wife's boyfriend is looking to move out of that 700sqft apt and into a crib. With existing home sales going crazy and prices skyrocketing, new builds / developments are positioned perfectly for those new home buyers, especially with interest rates at zero and stimmy checks going out.

TSMC has steadily been climbing from ~$85 to ~$130 today and it will continue. Why? They are the bottleneck on chip manufacturing for most of the modern chips being printed. 

The case:
TSM is one of 4 major foundries, and current produces the new M1 for Apple, AMD chips, ARM chips, and more. If it computes something, it's probably printed at TSMC foundries. 

They are so good at printing their chips that Intel even uses them now. Intel has their own foundry, but can't figure out how to print chips anymore (we'll see about their new CEO, but that's years out).

Meanwhile, TSMC is opening a new foundry in the USA to help with supply chain concerns in the US, as well as improve volume. https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/tsmc-to-build-a-12-billion-advanced-semiconductor-plant-in-arizona-with-u-s-government-support/

Given that the new admin will push out a ton of money to folks who will buy new computers, this seems good for TSMC. Not to mention all the retards here who will put their federally funded tendie money into the market. 

Get in however you want, but just know that TSMC will print all the things for you.

I think they're trying to cover quietly before they get squeezed.

MACD cross just happened on Friday and it is now above 20 and 50 day moving averages.  Nice bullish chart, and getting some hype on Twitter.

Here are a few key points 

1- The company has enjoyed double and triple digit earnings and sales growth over the past four quarters. The rate of growth is decelerating which maybe a concern going forward. The company has benefited from the stay at home world we find ourselves in due to Covid-19. In Q4 2019, the company earned 1.30/share which is lower than the Street’s estimate for Q4 2020 of $1.38/share. Meanwhile, revenue in Q4 2019 came in at $5.4 billion, which is lower than the Street’s estimate for Q4 2020 of $6.6 billion.

2- Technically, the stock is acting well as it builds a bullish base-on-base pattern to digest the recent and very strong rally from its March 2020 low just under $300/share. On the downside, the bulls want to see the stock continue trading above the old chart highs of $423/share. On the upside, the bulls would welcome a move above $545/share as that will likely pave the way back to the 2020 record high of $575.37/share and possibly beyond. Until either of those two levels are broken, odds favor this sideways sloppy base will continue.

Citron said that "there is no business that is more commoditized and competitive than having food delivered from the restaurant to your home."

DoorDash shares were up 5.3% to $197 at last check."

FB is the most undervalued mega tech growth stock on the market today. Period. I've heard the most insane statements with respect to the future of facebook as a company. "This is the end!", "Everyone's deleting their accounts!", "The scum of our society!", "Trump will teach them!", etc....

No one gives a fuck about your conservative right wing viewpoints. No one gives a fuck that you deleted your account (you have zero influence on the global population). This company will continue to steal your wife's boyfriend's daughter's soul and print cash to the cows come home.

Are you still not listening? This company has data on 40% of the global population. If there is nothing else to take away from this. Trust that this company will monetize that data over and over and over again. They will figure out how to make you an addict. Like heroin to the vein. Like you getting cucked by Jimbo the plumber.

Social media is officially a VICE. Same shelf as sex, drugs, gambling....I'll put my money behind these categories every day of the week.

Anyways. Take a look at growth. This company's earnings are ripping YoY. PEG ratio under 1. Forward P/E is trading like a boomer stock in today's environment.

SHUTUP and buy facebook before you realize you were a fucking idiot for not buying facebook.

"BUT ANTITRUST!" Shutup. Buy facebook.

**Position: 55x Jan 2023 $300C.**

UPDATE: Earnings are next Wednesday, if you want a cheaper and riskier play, buy $265-$275 with term that straddles earnings. I would buy into Feb/March. Rockets.

Around him were gathered aged and weathered men adorned in armor much too small for their frames, fattened from years of taking from the poor and helpless. The tent flaps parted and a bewildered soldier covered in blood and sweat stumbled in panting heavily.

Gayus was a simple man. Pessimistic if you asked his wife, though he never held much interest for her. Deep in his soul he knew the outcome of the campaign. He took a deep breath before committing.



“At first, my liege. It was only the Gamestopians. They were barely more than a gang of ruffians chasing dreams of yesteryear. A man appeared. A merchant of feed for hounds. He had built himself a successful business that led more farmers buying from him than the state itself.”



Gabe shook his head. “You’re telling me this is all because of a dogfood merchant?”



“His charisma is undeniable, my liege. The Palantards have pledged themselves to their cause. The Mountain of Steel and King Vito Corleone.  The Republic of Blaqberrie. The lost tribe of Gourd. Even across the sea, the Uropoors have been seen sending supplies. He surrounds himself with smart strategists and powerful champions. They carry a flag bearing a diamond with a simple peanut upon it. His greatest champion rides into battle wearing armor emblazoned with a roaring kitten. Soldiers swear he has the cunning of a tiger and the ferocity of a lion. The Roaring Kitty alone has flocked thousands of commoners to take up arms against us.”



The tent seemed to shrink and crush upon the beady eyes of Gabrilus. The ominous looming of his funder's expectations prodded at an already anxious mind. The Boomers were not a group to be slighted. After a moment of consideration Gabe had come to terms with the situation.



“Send out the messengers. Ply our allies of Schitron to debase and denounce the validity of these separatists. We must weaken their resolve. They are peasants. They will disperse. They must.”



The tent fell silent. A pounding grew in Gabe’s slightly misshapen head. Terrified howls and clanging swords could be heard. From the forests to the south, thousands of voices began chanting in unison.

Stem Inc. ($STPK) is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems, network integration, and battery optimization. They brand themselves as "the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public" - a lot of buzz words I know but bear with me

First, let's take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works. Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy. In recent years battery storage (and in part renewable energy) hasn't seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs.

This being said, recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial / industrial level. Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it.

https://preview.redd.it/xy2e3iml1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32

While battery storage has improved, it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn't feasible with our global energy infrastructure. Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production.

Ok, so now that we know how it works, what does the market look like?

* All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade
* Over the next decade, the US market is expected to grow at \~45% CAGR and the global market is expected to grow 31% CAGR
* Future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment

https://preview.redd.it/7x98ssvk1yb61.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e525ba6bab348a408ec2b59297d03cbcf5b896

Great, so how is $STPK revolutionizing this space? They are doing so by providing a "one stop shop" solution for utility companies. Stem's solution can provide integrations with hardware (batteries) and the grid (network), while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage.

https://preview.redd.it/ljxci0lu3yb61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2728140badcbc979109ce3c895f65d3e6057b26

Their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key.

Interesting, so let's move on to their AI software called Athena. Athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems, collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation, grid power or battery power.

https://preview.redd.it/gdctb7fs1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d3265db7fc1978a56bece0b8cac1385bac36f1

Athena is a HUGE part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary. It is a large part of their moat, as they have 24 issued patents for it (so no competitor can replicate it).

Now, let's move onto their financials. First, it's important to understand they have a hardware and software business

* Increased rev from $17 mil to $33 mil YoY, expected to increase to $147 mil in 2021
* 81% CAGR from 2020-2026
* Gross margins have hovered around 12-18% since 2018 but expected to increase to 40%+ by 2026
* 90% of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts (not pipeline!) -> underpromising and overdelivering
* Software revenue expected to account for 30% of total revenues by 2026
   * $14 mil in 2020 -> $240 mil by 2026
Yeah

A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward. They need to execute yes, but I'm confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5+ years, and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection. They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially.

Lastly, I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla's valuation is their energy business. Interestingly enough, they actually use batteries from Tesla, Samsung, and Panasonic. Additionally, they have a partnership with Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/0xxgetre2yb61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1046d1c13b9ea7363515171e0986eae45fbd0e

In my opinion, this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space. If any of you are interested, my investment thesis is finding the best pick and shovel plays in emerging industries, such as renewable energy, sports betting / gambling, genomics etc. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/enigma3916) for other DDs I have done.

TLDR: Stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain. More specifically:

* Large TAM + strong macro tailwinds
   * \~$1.2 trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by 2050
   * Battery storage capacity expected to increase by 25x by 2030
* Market leader with best in class technology
   * 900+ systems operating or contracted with Athena
   * 75% market share in CA BTM storage market, largest in the US
   * First mover AI platform that operates with 40+ utilities, 5 grid operators and over 16MM runtime hours
* Highly visible growth
   * Recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth
   * Revenues projected to grow at \~51% CAGR from 2021 to 2026

Elon musk said the 3 most important things are EV, solar energy, AND ENERGY STORAGE (watch vid above at 0:30)


ELON MUSK is building the batteries to store renewable energy, $STPK uses there software on Tesla’s batteries/and other batteries that makes them smart batteries

$STPK has more sales then Tesla/any other competitor (leading the market) by using third party batteries from Tesla. So to have more sales it must mean there software is pretty damn good as there literally using batteries from others. 

This industry is going to be huge, we need to store renewable energy as the sun doesn’t shine at night, and wind isn’t always blowing.

This stock is a baby 4bill market cap, has the most sales in the industry that’s expected to 25x (over 1.2 trillion, YET $STPK is leading the industry), and patented software with years worth of data

Bulls need consistent price increases to not get clubbed by MMs, until around 50, where option dealers/MMs will naturally help from that point until Friday. Friday will tend to significantly reverse whatever happened this week if movements were large (30%+). Bears should not get greedy under 27 or 26. Most price action early this morning was MM driven.  Gamma dead zones are seeming to trap the stock - the long hang at 38 was one such dead zone, then it shot through to 41.50, another dead zone - price does not want to be 38.50-41.50 for long because of gamma! Trading before dead zones in your favor (buying under a ramp, selling over a ramp) in this environment.**

**I'm sure I will get downvotes, but seriously, the gamma structure is slightly bullish for you guys and provides some trading opportunities for bulls and bears both, so please do upvote if you appreciate the original DD.**

This post is about the market maker positions in GME, and the effects that will have on the market. Recall that last week, MMs probably accounted for as much as 2/3 of the price action, acting as a lever for WSB's wipe out of a lot of short positions.

Right now, I believe dealers are massively long. I don't have great tools to calculate, but my guess is long about 10-15m shares. They are of course loaning these shares out to shorts, and making bank doing it since the lending rate is at 30% right now, with not a lot of shares available to short. This also means that if you buy puts from an MM, it's easy for them to hedge it - they just reduce their long.

In terms of what dealers will do as time goes on, you need to understand gamma ramps. Gamma ramps are prices where there are a LOT of open interest of options. As prices cross up over these, dealers (if they are short options, which I think they are and evidence suggests they are), have to buy like crazy. As price declines, they also sell like crazy. Gamma giveth, gamma taketh away.

At open today, I believe dealers had to buy about 5.5 million shares between open and the stock hitting $44. In other words, they were the majority of the price action over that range, fueled by WSB bid forcing them to in turn buy more stock. But this gamma is a negative too - as people sold positions or sold their ITM calls, dealers dumped stock back, and gamma kicked in, plummeting the stock back to the 38 range quite quickly.

As I mentioned last week, the heavy concentration of options at $39 and $40 mean that crossing these prices up or down is very easy, while crossing other prices is harder.

Below is a map of current gamma structure. It's written to represent puts below and calls on top, but really, it should be both below because I think dealers are extremely short options here (sold people calls AND puts).  These ramps, like I said, represent areas where price will move very quickly (and in the adjacent dollar to them really, but sharpest right at the price)

Next up is the is the map of options expiring this week. This is important because at the end of the week, anything in the money somewhat rolls off the MM books (some exercised, some rolled, but last friday was selling on similar effects, so would expect the same dynamic, which is selling if price up a lot, buying if price down a lot). If there are a lot of ITM calls, you expect selling Friday. If there are a lot of ITM puts, you expect buying Friday. Additionally, as the week goes on, ITM and OTM options sort of purify their impact. An OTM call today is going to be hedged by a MM with a long stock postiion. But as the week goes on, they hedge less since it becomes less likely. Similarly, an OTM put today is hedged with a short position. That'll be reduced over the week. For ITM positions, those go from partially hedged to fully hedged throughout the week.  Right now, there are a lot more near-term OTM call positions than puts, so the natural hedging behavior of MMs will be to sell stock unless the price is climbing quickly.

Here is this week's chart and next week's chart. You'll notice this week matters a lot more.

[https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX](https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX)

**Overall trading dynamics:**

\- Putting this really simply, if we go from $38 to $60, MMs would have to buy something like 13 or 14m shares. If we fall to 27, they will sell but less, maybe 9 or 10m shares. The gamma structure is slightly supportive of the bull ramp, but also can facilitate bear. So, ultimately, we can move fast, but it depends on the actions of investors - WSB buying vs old value holders liquidating shares, new short sellers, etc. I don't know what value investors are doing, but recall that when people were buying this at 5-10, they talked about price targets in the teens or even lower. We see circumstantial evidence of value trimming and selling, which is probably the main force in opposition of WSB buying.

\- Option dealers / MMs will make a lot of money if the stock closes around at a not high price this week due to the massive OI they'd have to hedge. It's not in their interest to get to the 20s necessarily, but they will make money more easily if short interest stays high, and this doesn't get into the 40s.  They love this situation because they are loaning out shares at a crazy borrow rate (since they are long the stock).

\- This does make the price vulnerable to options manipulation. Were someone to go out and buy a bunch of $45 puts right now, $100m of capital would in turn shoot 12m shares down, triggering more selling, probably causing a 24m sell to $27. Very tempting for a hedge fund. The same could happen in reverse on calls though. A similar strength ITM call buy would send the price to the 50s.

\- Crossing 39/40 is easy. I expect lots of ping-ponging around it.

\- Crossing multiples of 5 is easy, while in between numbers are harder and are gamma dead zones where stock will move more slowly and languish at times.

\- For bulls and bears - Buying or selling around ramps is probably sensible. For a bull, you'd want to buy right under a ramp that can shoot up price, such as 38.75 or something. For a bear, you'd want to sell right after a ramp, like at 42 or 41.5.

\- For bulls: Realistically, getting to low 40s is easy. Getting to low 50s is harder but entirely possible. Getting to 61/62 is also possible (Though harder still), but it's a heavy lift past that because there isn't OI there, and at that point, would require huge amounts of new money or short squeeze to happen.

\- For bears:  I'd say you are getting real greedy if you hold puts past the high 20s, because there's not a lot of gamma there, and there's a lot of short-cover motivation.

**Weekly Options Expiration Trading Dynamics**

Because there are many options expiring again this week, the effect of these and next weeks options decaying is important. Basically, as time goes forward towards expiration, the options look more and more like either a pure long or short position or a distant option, and hedging follows. Right now, a near the money call will be heavily hedged with stock, but by Friday, it will hardly be hedged at all. That means ITM calls that are near the money cause buying, OTM calls cause selling, ITM puts cause selling, OTM puts cause buying.

Looking at the current trading expirations, it would appear that at price levels before about 44 or 45, the options dealers/MMs are going to be dumping shares as they de-hedge all those calls you guys bought, and this is elevated in the 30s in general. After that, it starts to be the opposite of net buying. So for bulls, you really need to get the price up to 50, preferably 55, pretty fast for these effects to work in your favor. For bears, you kind of can expect that a stable price in the high 30s has a good chance of causing de-hedge into the 35 ramp, and then down to 30. I believe you start to get the opposite of net buying around 30 as time goes forward without price movement, but I'm not precisely sure.

Going into Friday, I'll post an update, but in general, there will be some reversal of whatever is ITM. If we were at 60, I'd definitely be selling into Friday. If we were at 25, I'd definitely be buying into Friday.

I should mention that the effects here are less powerful than last weeks, which were 2/3 responsible for the massive 126% meltup. Last week had a huge block of expiring options and just more OI in general. But, I still think MMs will be a major, maybe dominant, force this week.

I was told I needed this to prevent a ban:   🚀🚀🚀

*Also, I think MOASS is a questionable hypothesis, while short squeeze is very possible, and $60 is possible. But that's another discussion, that probably isn't possible with the downvote environment. TLDR is that dealers have a lot of shares they are lending, institutions hedge all the time and very high prices mean they end up sitting on 20m+ shares, and bidding past $60 is a heavy lift largely unassisted by gamma, at least this week.*

*I do own Chewy shares - 280 of them, about 200% gains on them, so I'm not some sort of RC hater.*

*Positions: still short with puts, $38 strike. This post's information is bullish actually assuming momentum continues. My reasons for being bearish are not relevant to this post, and I got downvoted on that elsewhere. No, I don't work for Melvin, and they have no position now as far as we know - their puts expired worthless last Friday, and their actions all made you bulls about $3 a share FYI by contributing to price reduction from September until 2 weeks ago, then helping fuel the massive gamma squeeze last week.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSX:BB - WILL BE $15 TODAY!!! 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Holding the line boys 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can I get a 'Fuck Citron!' _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME broke its own ATH for mentions this weekend.

1. Upwards acceleration of $GME price makes it absolutely impossible for  🌈🐻 to control their losses. It was absolutely imperative to break the rally today and under no circumstance allow a 20%+ jump. This is an orchestrated attack on Ryan Cohen, WSB and $GME community
2. Shitron conveniently made today's announcement of an announcement, that will be AFTER market open tomorrow, when the up-tick rule is no longer in place. Why won't Shitron post their tHeSiS today (it's only 5 points after all)? 🌈🐻 are planning to switch on the fraud machine and ramp-up NAKED short selling
3. Their 5 reasons will be total bearshit. There is absolutely nothing new that Shitron can know about $GME that Ryan Cohen, u/deepfuckingvalue or WSB degenerates who've been covering this story for more than a year could know.

TLDR at Bottom

I'll get straight to the point.  MIK is extremely undervalued right now, and is going to moon due to its statistics indicating a stock much below industry average, strong earnings outlook due to circumstances, and VERY HIGH possibility of a short squeeze.

    MIK’s P/E ratio is much further below industry standard at (during time of writing) 10.93 compared to general retail’s current P/E ratio of 23.23 (according to NYU).  Including MIK’s strong earnings outlook, this indicates a very low P/E ratio, forcing the stock higher.  Following the current trends of Retail, and assuming Michaels was at the current general retail P/E ratio, it would not be a stretch to assume that the stock could double by the end of the year, and go up a very sizable amount in the short term.  This follows the trend set by the stock price since march.  This trend is set to continue and the reasons why will be explained in the next paragraph.

    Excluding 2020 Q2 (for hopefully obvious reasons), as the year has gone along MIK has beaten earnings by a good amount.  In 2020 Q3 by 0.38$,  2020 Q4 by 0.27$, and with 2021 Q1 coming with a substantial earnings estimate jump along with it being $1.43 compared to 2020 Q4’s $0.59 estimate, shows great growth for MIK.  With many new strains of the coronavirus showing up, MIK’s classification as an essential business, and many people doing/ trying arts and crafts at home, along with school projects also mostly happening during the 2021 Q1 period, this shows a great earnings growth possibility, which will spike the stock, especially compounded with what is mentioned in the next paragraph.

    A retail short squeeze similar to what is happening with GME and BBBY is also likely to happen to MIK very soon.  At Dec 31 2020, MIK had a short percentage of float of 33.25% (extremely high is 20%), along with the average time to short expiry being 3.44 days, a short squeeze is imminent, and along with the high possibility of growth, the imminent short squeeze will only spike the stock higher.  Note that while the short percentage of float is lower than BBBY or GME, the average short expiry time is also much lower, showing that those who are shorting are starting to get forced to cover at higher and higher prices.

TLDR

Good statistics and an imminent short squeeze are sending MIK to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[Time to leave this planet BOIS! DD below:](https://preview.redd.it/kuljgwjybbc61.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec855495df25bccffaf700a6c548a90119af43ff)

So I talked about the short squeeze opportunity last thursday. Look at this little beauty today. She is literally getting an ELON ticket to mars, along with your lovely little pumpers. If you want an in depth DD, check out my last post. But ill do a small recap here for those with é Retardatíon.

&#x200B;

1. SPWR has WORLD RECORD solar cell efficiency rate over other competitors, as acknowledged by the US government.
2. Someone had the audacity to say that this is SOLYNDRA on my last post. This company has been around since 1985 with minimal government subsidizing. Unlikely to all the sudden go tits up.

**3) short float sitting at 50.31 percent.** REMEMBER that this short float percentage includes all shares outstanding, not just the public float. So actual percentage short is much higher. Where are you going to find a nicely shorted Solar stock that is set to benefit from renewable energy initiatives?

3) Direct benefit from biden plans.

**4) Breaking out from key levels.** This stock was holding 33 STRONG but with solid BDE today and a test on thursday, she broke above the 33 range and is looking to squeeze to the upside.

**5) Growing revenue:** Revenues for SPWR are expected to grow 23.21% this year, and is expected to have an EPS increase of 184.2% for 2021. SPWR also has a history of beating earnings, beating earnings estimates the last 4 quarters.

Join me in our quest to tendie island, and lets retire together together by using our bodies as solar panels on the beach. Vitamin D bitches.

Love and Peace,

TL/DR SPWR TO MOON. 50 C 1/29/21

EDIT: we need to get to mars somehow so here you tendie unicorns go: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thank you WSB $BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have a question - isn't what Citron is doing a legit example of Market Manipulation? Greetings,

this is not a rage post for the less gains of PLTR or GME, this is a general honest question for you, market experts, from a student that has not sat in the market too long to know it's legal side. Is what Citron doing not illegal? Below is the image of Citron's price targets and stocks which were incredible misses based in the long run (credit to a comment under their most recent twitter post).

https://preview.redd.it/5bqxw7p36bc61.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4feb091f746c4f37449cad8125259d696d242cba

Is this not market manipulation 101 at it's finest and is this legal?  Is there any entity that could punish them? Is there anything that we, the people, can do something about it? I am basically doing outright opposite of what they are trying to do and buying the dip on every single stock that they short, get some decent gains, but it troubles me so much to see a truly strong stock, for example, like SHOP and see it get downgraded so much just to derail the hype or a high price. Insights, please?

EDIT: and I know some of the comments will be that they are only expressing their opinion, but given the fact that they do have an influence on the market, shouldn't they be responsible for more things as well?

EDIT 2: I am saying this not to brag "oh, stonk went up and someone downgraded it just to f w/ it", I am expressing my opinion cause *Citron has a reputation* of doing such things when a stock hits catalyst/positive growth.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I like meme stocks as much as any of you, but take a look at $GILD before it's too late. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citron Research Who? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TSLA Prediction for End of 2021. **EDIT: Prediction for End of January 2021.**

Here’s my slightly bold predictions in anticipation of Tesla’s Q4 Earnings Call on 1/27.

On market close of 1/15 $826.16 per share, marking a 6.5% decline in value from TSLA’s all time high of $880.02 just two weeks prior. As TSLA’s history has proven time and time again, these temporary reductions in price represent a perfect time to invest, as TSLA shares tend to climb in a roaring fashion following short bursts of decline.

[TSLA 1\/19\/2021 Immediately Prior to Post Submission.](https://preview.redd.it/nrhqdjrg1bc61.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8fb13d1e6466bb746b64d36f7a90b3141b032b)

This is not to mention Tesla’s record-breaking numbers that will be announced on the earnings call 1/27. I predict by the month’s end, TSLA shares surpass and create a new all time high, possibly greater than $900/share.

This is definitely extremely bullish, however here are the key components that make up this prediction.

&#x200B;

1. Tesla’s Q4 earnings call will announce record-breaking free cash flow, revenue, deliveries, and gross profit. Actualizing these numbers to investors will drive shares up.
2. Many casual investors and bystanders underestimate the profit margins of the new Model Y. Retailing for $4,000 more than the Model 3, Tesla has previously shared that the cost of manufacturing a Model Y is less than a Model 3 due to improving technology in the manufacturing process. Not to mention Tesla’s Q4 press release did not include the rumored 100k MYs sold in under 10 hours in China as a result of the lower than expected retail. All in all, Tesla will have delivered excess of 500k vehicles and a net profit higher than expected.

3. 2021 Guidance. It is understandable that many Tesla investors are eagerly awaiting Tesla's projections for 2021 deliveries. The current "expert" consensus is \~771k deliveries, whereas I predict Tesla's 2021 guidance for deliveries to be around 850k. However, I bet internal goals will be closer to 1M vehicles delivered, as both gigafactory Berlin and Austin are slated to begin producing vehicles mid-2021. If the 850k guidance is correct and reached at the end of 2021, that will mark a 70% expansion in deliveries from 2020, putting Tesla on pace for another record year in sales & deliveries.

4. Expect Tesla to unveil additional details to current and future projects during the Q4 earnings call. Projects that could be mentioned include: Tesla Roadster, Tesla \~$25k car, Cybertruck, Semitruck, and New Gigafactory.

[Tesla Roadster](https://preview.redd.it/ptdkh3u81bc61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e0c20888e1aee287f64d1e3c76ef196be394a8)

Hyped Couture's recommendation for market open 1/19: BUY_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NOVA - A beast in the solar sector The recent slaughter in energy/solar sector might have scared you out- But I think it's due for a ramp up. $NOVA has pulled back to its 21ema, and under is its 50ma, in addition to all of this, there a beautiful bull-flag in development. Moreover to this, the breadth in this sector has finally been restored, a majority of stocks were all overextended above the 8ema, and were able to relax coming down to 21ema on friday, giving us the benefit of sector wide breadth which will allow us to run even further!

$NOVA has a great fundamental story as well, they are one of the leading companies in the solar space which does not get the credit it deserves. With Biden's new green deal shenanigans, and all the solar pump+energy pump I can see $NOVA running to at least 70, which is both in reach technically through fibb extension+fundamental. 

$NOVA is like the $NVDA of tech, quite, but extremely explosive in setups! 

I'll post pictures of the setup below, I advise waiting for the breakout and then entering, after 50 breaks comes 70+

I have previously provided DD in three separate posts: Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/), Part 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx7sh6/callaway_part_2/), and Part 3 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxxd4q/callaway_part_3/). **As mentioned previously, we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion and growing at ridiculous levels! 🚀**

**In the last post, I focused on the synergistic effect from CALLaway purchasing Topgolf. This time I want to talk about the people behind CALLaway, and I will be using the DD from one of my favorite retards,** u/rwm3188. The founder, Ely CALLaway. was a Southern gentleman army vet who made wine, golfed, and absolutely fucked. **He named the first driver he created “Big Bertha.”** You know this man loved the thick, and when fat women complained he just made them test out the driver. (cite [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/06/sports/ely-callaway-golf-club-maker-dies-at-82.html)). **The current CEO, Chip Brewer, lives and breathes golf. He turned around Adams Golf in the '00s and made them profitable, and grew Callaway's market cap steadily since he took over in 2012**. The only significant dips in the stock price under his leadership appear to have been cyclical and correlate with greater market dips/crashes. He has an MBA from Harvard, which should be a strike against him, but he’s a bit old school so that’s ok. **🚀**

Now we come to **Dolf Berle, the former Dave & Busters cowboy who currently helms Topgolf** and [still has a Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolf-berle-b475b111/). First of all, his name is fucking Dolf; not to be mistaken with Dolph Lundgren, but equally if not more badass. **Our Dolf is a decathlete and he competed on American Ninja Warrior.** Put him in a ring with Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Alex Karp, and see who comes out. I fucking dare you. He also has an MBA from Harvard, which should be a strike against him, but he has an MA in African Studies from the University of Zimbabwe, which only elicits autism in its purest form. Although Dolf will likely be leaving the company following the merger, there is no doubt he has left his imprint on our baby. **🚀**

Let’s make magic happen my retards. You all inspire me, and hopefully we can make ourselves rich as all hell. I want to give a special shoutout to all the retards working overtime, especially  [u/Healthy-Cash8610](https://www.reddit.com/user/Healthy-Cash8610/), who has been spreading the good word over the weekend. We have a movement here, let's make it big. **Buy $ELY stock and calls. Autists Assemble!**

**TLDR: $ELY to the moon 🚀🌙**

Edit 1: The bears are trying to sodomize us today, but let's not give in retards. Buy the dips! Buy shares!

Edit 2: Pretty sure you retards just took it from -3% to green. Amazing work.

Edit 3: We are up over 4% since the legendary memelord, u/ptgauth, commented on this post. Nothing but **🚀🚀** for him and $PLTR.

[PART 5 IS HERE BITCHES CONGRATS!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1b583/callaway_part_5/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB DD🚀🚀🚀 Reasons for a buy in:

-Incredible value
You’ve heard this before, now let’s understand why.  Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it’s just a matter of time🚀🚀🚀
-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginning🚀🚀🚀
AWS Partnership

-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon’s IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retards🚀🚀🚀🚀
-John Chen👑

Saved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.  If that wasn’t enough, he is taking bonuses in shares and gets a huge bonus when shares reach $30, this means his bottom line for the company vision is the same as ours. Shares🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
-Large Mobilization of Funds

BB sold 90 patents to Huawei, which serves 2 fold, no more fees on those patents and also increased capital.  As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Reasons (not)to Buy:

Earnings Down/
Analysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.

If IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...  Given the new value however, I’m confident in its larger profit margin. Or at the very least in leu of new value and a credible partnership significant increase in licensing sales, especially so in the Emerging EV market!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

In conclusion BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
Position: 80 shares @9.70

My brothers in arms. Many years from now our souls will no longer roam this earth but instead feast in Valhalla. While filling our stomachs with mead and tendies, Odin focuses his attention on us and asks each of us to recount our first struggle towards glory.  

I know the first story I will tell. 

The year is 2021. The COVID pandemic has delayed my arrival towards off-campus university housing, but it's better late than never. My parents decided it would be a good idea to front my entire "meal plan" for groceries, utilities, and wash for the semester into my savings much like an actual university meal plan. Little do they know that they’ve just armed me for war. My honor and loyalty towards my countrymen (WSB) sent me into the front lines against literal giants (Hedge Funds) and the cuck lord himself, Melvin. I stand fast in the front lines with my "meal plan" money all in GME, BB, & PLTR shares. Only those with diamond hands stand by my side. At this point those with paper hands retreated at the first glimpse of the army of giants that lay ahead. 

For now that's where the tale ends. Yet a small stake compared to others, this is everything to my name. With my semester officially starting tomorrow I have approximately 15 weeks (or 107 days) to survive. I have already put together a shopping list that should cost me about $30. This means I can eat until 1/29 all things included. This $30 shopping list is what remains of my leftover “meal plan” as I could not buy another share of GME. Moral of the story: Either in this life or the next I will be feasting. Wish me luck m8s and godspeed.

TLDR: Fuck. You. Melvin._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🥜🚀Squeeze Myths & Price Jump Research💎🙌 TL;DR at the end. These are 2 better safe than sorry fixes for saving your GME tendies.

Two important things to know about limit orders:

1. They can change your limit price. They can even do it multiple times. But only under certain conditions. specifically limit orders placed during a halt can be repriced to fit the trading bands. So if you're looking at reputable charts (not robinhood) and trading is halted, don't send in an order. You'll get fucked by gay bears.

One suggests that they can only change it in your favor, but why take the risk? Don't place orders during a halt (it's dumb anyways).

>Q:   How will orders priced aggressively through a Price Band be handled by Nasdaq? (For example, price bands are $9.00/$11.00 and a bid is entered for $11.05)?

>Orders that are priced aggressively outside the bands will be re-priced upon entry to the limit price bands (both IOC and longer time-in-force orders). Non-IOC orders that are slid due to LULD will receive a time-stamp upon being booked and will be treated according to standard price-time priority.•  For limit-priced orders entered via OUCH protocol. Incoming limit-priced orders shall reprice upon entry only once and subsequently will cancel resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) if Price Bands move such that the price of the resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

>•  For limit-priced orders entered via RASH or FIX protocols. Exchange systems shall reprice multiple times any limit priced interest to buy (sell) to the upper (lower) Price Band if Price Bands move such that the price of resting limit priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf

and for another easier to read source: 

>The NBBO can be accessed if it is resting on the Price Bands.  However, if the stock is in a Straddle State, the bid or of f er outside t he price band is deemed non-executable.  *Therefore market  orders or aggressively priced limit  orders may be reject ed back t o t he sender or re-priced by exchanges once the price bands are reached.  There is currently no uniform practice by the stock exchanges on how market orders will be handled in a Straddle State.*  It is possible that bids and offers can fade fast er then the ref erence price is adjust ed.  However, the exchanges are st ill discussing how often  this  may  actually  occur  in  practice.  NASDAQ  conducted  two  studies  last  summer;  in  a  9  day  trading  period  N A SD A Q  examined  6100  Tier  2  stocks  and  not ed  t hat   t here  were  3800  instances  of   a  Straddle  St at e  t hat   averaged  12.5 minutes. Tier 1 stocks, in theory, should not see too many Straddle States.

\2. Putting in a sell order does not guarantee anything. The only way to guarantee it is to ask for a certificate for your shares which no one here is doing. There is a lot of conflicting info on this, ***but since they can't change your prices unless you placed a trade, even a limit order during a halt, you may as well put your big ass limit orders up ahead of time.*** Better safe than sorry.  Squeeze until squoze.

---

When to sell?

It's easier to wait for the drop to sell most of it, trailing out 5-10% every $125 (starting at $150-$175) or so up until then. Even small balls should hold most of it until longer though. Potentially 3x the profits when we diamond hands. With the Volkswagen infinity squeeze, you got more money selling it after the initial spike then you did selling it before. And the timing was much easier.

>Months leading up to MOASS, stock price doubled and there was a big dip the Friday before the MOASS ( € 65 Euro drop).

>Monday - At start of trading day jumps to € 348, up 66% from Friday close b/c of weekend press release by Porsche. Closes the day up 149%.

>Tuesday - Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up. During day it hits the high point at € 1K . It closed at € 945 that Tuesday.

>Wednesday - Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts. And price starts going down.

>Friday - Closed at € 495.

Price Jump Research:

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l00y1h/the_effect_of_short_interest_on_stock_performance/gjr3r4a/?context=3) is a paper from actual college educated researchers on how much a squeeze will squoze based on short interest. For the non readers it is a .6% share price buff per 1% of SI, ON TOP OF THE NORMAL VALUATION.

That's right autists. You're going to take $315 (@ 150% SI) and add it to your estimated actual GME value At the same time, the Infinity Squeeze means the rate of increase itself could also jump up quickly.  So put in your limit orders well ahead of time at astounding prices and DO NOT resend them if the market is halted, the MM can change the prices during a halt. Not a market order either unless you want to be matched up with some 🌈🐻 covering for $20/share. Limit orders are the way.

**TL;DR:** Set your limits ahead of time but 420 is way too low to stick it to the shorts. Take your GME valuation and add $315 minimum in squeeze bonus to get a your squeeze target. For timing it the best price was one day after the squeeze, while the price 3,4 and 5 days after the squeeze we're all still better than day 1 (for the Volkswagen infinity squeeze) Do NOT place limit orders, or any order, while trading is halted or they can slide your limit price around to feed the shorts.


#REAL TL;DR FOR SMOOTH BRAINS: 

Place limit orders ahead of time at gigantic prices, 1k will keep it safe until you sell it (or make you a 40 bagger) but don't place limit orders while the stock has been halted.

WHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK

I am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don’t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I’ll provide receipts. Additionally I’m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.

Military use of the program is simply not  “spying on you” bullshit they’d have you eat up on the 🌈🐻 articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can’t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it’s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn’t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in ‘killing bad dudes’ then they’ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you’re already paying for. I wouldn’t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.

Commercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they’re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN 🇯🇵 (should’ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I’ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn’t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn’t ripe with competitive companies like the 🌈🐻s would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can’t express enough how much of a buy this is.

Palantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they’ve been increasing the amount of ‘news’ on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they’re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it’ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. 

TL;DR 
I wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter

I have been late doing some DD on Nokia and I have mixed fillings about it. Mostly because it has been talked about here since summer and we see what is going on. But to be fair I think that 5G revenue has not yet started pouring in. 

I feel optimistic about this stock way more than many analysts. This is where I have my question. When you are making future forecasts are you taking  in to account this gamechanging events such as 5G as well or are you just looking at a companies current revenua and CAGR and deals with in their current reach? Since ther new CEO they have been laying off many  people in order to lower their costs.

If the major players for 4G towers have climbed so high (American Tower, SBA, Crown Castle and Wow per say) and have p/e ratios 3x Nokia. I think it is fair to assume that once more telephones start using 5g this will get more attention. We were supposed to have 5g in late 2020 but corona shiftet everything to 2021.
I mean ther forecast haven't changed since q1...meanwhile they signed 100 new contracts. They are cutting expenses and their other revenue will mostly stay. What am i missing?

Intel's desperate move of hiring one of their  original  processor designers in an attempt to quell the rumors abound  regarding  them falling behind the game, shows that they are just that; an  antiquated has-been who is holding onto their market share so tight that it's slipping between their bony liver-spotted hands.

But things are about to get real; Q4 data  that  is being released on January 26th will show what retailers already know.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

5. Can be perceived by Americans as an Anti-China play like someone pointed out; bringing manufacturing onshore again

Virgin Orbit is the 2nd company to successfully get satellites to orbit by launching a rocket from an airplane. They are the third non-government US company to get *any* satellites to orbit. This is extremely impressive and a huge milestone to hold. While I still have more faith in SpaceX and their engineers--there is plenty of room for other innovative players in the space industry, and Virgin Orbit just proved themselves worthy. They also prove that SpaceX isn't the only ballsy company willing to take risks to innovate in space.

NOW, Virgin Orbit is not a publicly traded company, but they do roll up under the huge Virgin conglomerate, Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, and you guessed it...Virgin Galactic. Virgin owns \~33% stake in both Virgin Orbit and Virgin Galactic (SPCE). I already dumped some money into SPCE this morning around $32 and plan on getting calls today looking out anywhere from one week to one year.

If you haven't seen--Cathie Wood (famous for ARK investment ETFs) has also announced the upcoming ARKX ETF -- an ETF for space stocks. This is also good bullish news. There are also shorts pushing on SPCE currently (I'm seeing \~5% HTB rate), which can easily contribute to a quick increase in price if they decide to cash out. If shorts continue to hold, well then its easy money for me long term because they'll have to buy back in eventually as space stocks continue to rise._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO announces closing of convertible notes offering, raising amount to $1.5 billion _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tendieman v3 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir & PG&E multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract marks the first time Palantir’s Foundry software is being used by a major U.S. utility’s operations 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB vs GME technical analysis Is BB the next meme stock?

My 5 cents: 

BB looks extremely bullish in my opinion. After reaching a multi year all-time low it was in flat for nearly 8 months. Then it had a run-up on very heavy volume followed by correction. And now it looks like a strong bullish trend will continue. 

Now I didn't check if there are any good news or upcoming catalysts or what the fundamentals are on BB. 

But if they are good then I would definitely consider going long._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For all the autists bored af the past few days. MARKETS OPEN SOON TARDS! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Check out my New Strategy based on Volume Hello my fellow retards

As I already pointed out in my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kicipr/how_to_spot_an_explosive_breakout/) I really like the “3 ascending volume bars” pattern. In my opinion it can be used to find a perfect entry point on any time frame. It works on 15M time frame just as good as on Daily or even Weekly.

Today I’m going to introduce you to my newly developed strategy that is solely based on “3 ascending volume bars” pattern.

In this strategy in order to identify a perfect entry point we will be using two time frames: Weekly and Daily.

What we are looking for is 3 ascending volume bars not only on Weekly time frame but also on Daily.

First of all I will show how this pattern looks on tickers that you all are familiar with. In every example there will be a ticker with two time frames (Weekly and Daily) and a finger mark pointing at a place where this pattern was formed.

So, here we go:

[XPEV](https://imgur.com/WeoOw6A) [WKHS](https://imgur.com/cdSGPEv) [ZM](https://imgur.com/TJjBnAm) [DKNG](https://imgur.com/ep6dab8) [PLTR](https://imgur.com/9EVYieU) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/Vi2Khxe) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/ZAHGB8y) [PTON](https://imgur.com/E1qPuL9) [NKLA](https://imgur.com/Icrhuci) [JMIA](https://imgur.com/aR6qSrm) [LAZR](https://imgur.com/1R3ONcZ) [FUTI](https://imgur.com/F3XlYNU)

Now that you’ve all seen how it looks on history and how much up-move  to expect in general I will show you how to find it in real time.

It’s actually pretty simple. All you need to do is insert the following simple criteria in your screener:

1. Market Cap. Choose whichever you like. I personally like under 10B. Tickers with small capitalization are really wild and volatile in general.
2. Performance. Choose – Week Up. With this pattern we are looking for tickers that are currently trending up.
3. Average Volume. Choose – Over 1 M. We don’t need illiquid shit.
4. Relative Volume. Choose – Over 2. That will show us tickers with ascending volume bars.

Here’s a [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_midunder,sh_avgvol_o1000,sh_relvol_o2,ta_perf_1wup&ft=4&o=-marketcap) screener with those criteria already input.

After we get results from the screener there’s a last step to make: manual selection.

First of all open the ticker on Weekly time frame. If it has 3 Weekly ascending volume bars formed then check it on Daily time frame. Also 3 ascending volume bars present? Bingo! We have a pattern!.

And last but not least I ran this screener yesterday to see if the pattern was present on Friday and It came back with 6 tickers that will high likely print within the next few days/weeks.

Here they are:

[CYH](https://imgur.com/VTpzwST) looks very bullish

[OZON](https://imgur.com/7ZtVfoe) looks very bullish. Recent IPO, great pattern, all-time high are all signs of the following up-trend

The most Bullish, Misunderstood Aspect that EVERYONE needs to read. Rally the troops, my brothers, for the war could be over very soon. Hello, my favourite paste-eating, rocket-posting children. In a few hours, the market opens, and the flood gates will begin. I'm all for GME, both for the MOASS and the long-term outlook of the company. I have been theory crafting all weekend, reading every fucking DD, Discussion, and Shitpost since August 2020 post to this god-forsaken Subreddit and there is one simple fact that is currently not being discussed. I'll start off with a TL,DR and then go from there.

TL,DR: Bears are undeniably fucked, You control the power, GME is not going to the moon, but to the edge of the fucking observable universe.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let's go, Gamestop has a NEGATIVE Float. There is likely not an original Gamestop issued share left on the market. What do I mean? Per my last post, I told you that there are approx 69.75 million OG shares, and approx \~75 Million shares owned by insiders (board of directors)/top 10 institutions\[1\]. meaning the likelihood of the shares that you, me, and DeeEffVee own are a shorted share. What I failed to emphasize, is the ABSOLUTE SHEER MAGNITUDE of the situation. There is no way that shorts can get themselves out of it. They're only going to be buying back their shorted shares which, since they are above 100%, there is no way to do that, unless institutions sell off everything they own into the open market. Which is unlikely, as institutions are in it for a long haul, but there may be some trimming on the way up. 

I've commonly simplified this potential squeeze as 100 PS5s(common shares) and 134 PS5 buyers(shorts), but I've had an epiphany that it is wrong. The 100 PS5s are already purchased, sitting in the institution/insider's homes and more than likely, the shares that are out there being traded have been created by the shorts. Where the fuck am I going with this? THERE ARE NO PS5s LEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND I ARE PLAYING WITH IS A SHORTED SHARE. THERE IS NO TRUE FLOAT LEFT, AND NOW WE ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH FUCKING IOUs. We still have legal ownership, and voting power with our shares, but they've been created out of the borrowing process of shorting a share, and not a genuine OG share. I reiterate, Gamestop is essentially in a Negative float % position.

Now, what does that mean for the outcome of the situation? bringing up some data that u/TitusSupremus provided on his last post, we can see that of the 79,519,042 shorted shared, 68% or 54,168,330 of all shorted shares are shorted on margin. Some of which are naked shorted shares, which of course, is an illegal activity when not covered within a 3 day timeframe. (we are at trading day #27.) With many brokerages starting to increase their margin requirements, and maintenance %'s. Brokers will force a buy-to-close on short positions on behalf of the shorts. This is going to cause a snowball effect, coupled with the SEC 201 (Up-Tick Rule enacted until EOD Tuesday 01/19/2021).

I have two theories of what may happen tomorrow/this week

1)Margin call happens, we have an increase of buying pressure due to all you loyal GME DiamondHands, along with retail and investment F.O.M.O., ALONG WITH MARGIN CALLED SHORTS WHO CAN'T CLEAR UP ENOUGH CAPITAL TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS, all the buying pressure means that price goes up and our friend SEC 201, more brokers are going to buy-to-close, etc. etc. taking us well beyond $420.69 and into the territory of whatever price you want to sell at. 

2)We remain fairly flat, since shorts can only sell on the up-tick, throughout the day, as brokers are allowing shorts to clear up capital on other investments to cover their margin call. More illegal shorting occurs, and shorts double down on their position even greater. Wednesday and beyond, just spikes and dips like we’ve seen since last week on an upward trend. 

Positions: 1000 shares @ 15.84

Why I love It (Long read) ✨🌎 What is Stellantis

STELLANTIS is rooted in the Latin verb “stello” meaning “to brighten with stars”. It draws inspiration from this new and ambitious alignment of storied automotive brands and strong company cultures that in coming together are creating one of the new leaders in the next era of mobility while at the same time preserving all the exceptional value and the values of its constituent parts. It will be traded with $STLA on NYSE and european markets.

The merger will create an auto group with combined annual sales of around 8.1 million vehicles with revenue for around 200 billion of dollars and deep enough pockets to fund the shift to electric driving and take on bigger rivals Toyota and Volkswagen Group.

“The merger between Peugeot S.A. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. that will lead the path to the creation of Stellantis N.V. became effective today,” the two automakers said in a statement”.

Short brand analysis:

Brands like Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep are historical brands that can perform well on asian market especially in China — they are still at the beginning, but this is why is exciting. Fiat, Peugeot and Citroén are beloved brands in Europe, Vauxhall is a loved brand in UK. Lucrative SUVs by Jeep, Ram and Dodge will continue to innovate and push in the US. Chrysler is rebuilding its vehicles with success, see Chrysler Pacifica. Fiat, not just in Italy, but in Brazil and Argentina is among the top-sellers. Former PSA is leader in Europe, while FCA in US has an important market share. The lucrative market of pickups and small vans for the deliveries are the part of the culture of these companies, in fact the EU commission before the green light highlighted the fact that former PSA and FCA are leader of the sector. Former PSA has strong EV technologies, see the platforms and products it built, but even FCA showed with the new 500BEV with Samsung batteries how the former italian-american automaker is able to innovate

CEO Star: Carlos Tavares

    Management: CEO Carlos Tavares is widely considered one of the best CEO on the automaker field; Mike Manley head of Stellantis America, former CEO of FCA and former Jeep, Ram, Dodge manager did a very good job after the death of Sergio Marchionne;

Some interesting technologies:

eVMP is the full-electric car platform developed by the former PSA Groupe;

infotainment UConnect5 by former FCA is full-custom infotainment system based on Android that now Fiat and Jeep uses on their latest models;

New Products

Stellantis has dozens of products, we’ll talk about these models in the next articles, but for now, according to this graphic, the lineup of Stellantis’ products are just 4.5 older than VW products.

This is just the beginning…

This is just a very very little intro about Stellantis and why we believe it will be a real “Empire” in the industry. We’ll talk more and more about it in the next articles, but we want to give some “titles”: the special relationship with Tesla, the strong partnership(s) with Waymo (Google), Foxconn, BPN Paribas, Total, Crédit Agricole, TIM, Amazon, Enel, Engie, Aurora Innovation, Archer Aviation. The successfully spin-off of Ferrari (listed at around $15B, now market cap of $54B), the re-launch of Maserati, the value of Jeep alone is worth dozens of billion dollars according to Morgan Stanley, the investments in India, the projects in China and much much more_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB Moon Rocket launch prep is almost complete 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR Demo Day 🚀 See You on The Moon 🚀 Mark Your Calendar _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Gourd Project: Biodegradable cups grown from gourd **Cups For The Future**

For the last few years, CRÈME / Jun Aizaki Architecture & Design has been exploring a way to bypass this waste cycle through a biodegradable molded gourd. We call it “The Gourd Project”. Along the exploration that this thought intitiated, CRÈME identified gourds as a fast growing plant that bears robust fruits each season, developing a strong outer skin, and fibery inner flesh. Once dried, gourds have traditionally been used by ancestors as receptacles like cups. CRÈME explored this centuries-old craft, using molds to grow gourds into functional shapes, such as cups and flasks to create sustainable, renewable, and compostable products without waste.

This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME’s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there’s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.

In this post, I’m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME’s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.

**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I’ve gone all-in - *I’m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you’re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you’re going to lose by selling when it drops.

# Quick aside - my history and positions:

I’ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I’ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I’ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I’ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.

&#x200B;

[$10K - $130K in 5 months on GME](https://preview.redd.it/lql0kscd08c61.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae80bf27a33908756e3f4245ccc83fc82df6c211)

All that being said, thus far I’ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I’ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That’s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I’m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.

Grab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I’ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn’t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you’re willing to **believe and hold.**

# About Cohen (and friends)

From the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you’re putting serious money in):

*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*

This is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.

1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME’s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn’t attempt a hostile takeover.
2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said “no” to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.

In addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):

* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)
* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)

He’s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he’s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.

As a result of the agreement, he’s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He’s not happy with a single board seat; he’s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he’s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**

Also, remember that **Alan and Jim have 💲 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.

## Cohen is not an exec - he’s a founder with an all-in mentality

Go read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.

1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:
   1. *“When I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\*.”\*
   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You’re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you’re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**
   3. *“Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”*
2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad’s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he’s itching to get back in.
3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.
4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.
   1. *“ Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.”*
   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.
   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.
   4. I’m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*
5. Cohen’s 9,001,000 (it’s over 9000! 🐲🏐) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.

So Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he’s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen’s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.

## What will lead to Cohen’s next purchase of GME

Thus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.

1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):
   1. “We recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)”**  (what a *fucking burn*).
2. If there was any doubt about RC’s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3’s earnings, where the current leadership’s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - “The market wants me. Let me the fuck in.”
3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he’s going to angle for CEO. He’s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He’s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*

**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he’s sending another message.** This time it’s because it’s clear to him he’s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it’s “CEO talks going well” - you fucking buy.**

# GME’s market cap potential

1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME’s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\+.
2. Chewy’s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.
3. Chewy’s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME’s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy’s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).
4. GME’s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

In other words, *even if you give GME’s physical locations no value*, GME’s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.

**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**

What. The. Fuck.

I’ve never seen a stock more mispriced.

People talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*

Even if you *completely* discount

1. GME’s physical business
2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT
3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM

and give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**

**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you’re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You’re going to only care if you’re in or not.

# Potential Investors

An asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?

Here’s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.

1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.
   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. "Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it." 🚀
2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I’m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It’s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.
3. **Cohen’s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.
   1. Look, I’ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don’t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don’t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don’t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME’s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he’s CEO.** As soon as he’s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.
      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.
   2. Thus far, it’s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That’s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.
4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate 💎✋🤚. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. 💎✋🤚 doesn’t mean selling at $100. It doesn’t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.
   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.
   2. Remember Buffett’s actual quote: [**"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)

**I’ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.

This is personal research. **Do your own DD.**

A wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***“Don’t aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.”*** If you’re not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren’t participating.

Oh, and of course: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Update 1:** I'm still holding today, but I realized I made a pretty big mistake on the ecommerce revenue analysis. GME's 2019 e-commerce revenue was 1.35B (not 1.35B for the quarter), so divide my price target by 4 - $125/share or $8B market cap. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ornamental gourd futures _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ OVER/UNDER HOW MANY MODS ARE GAY There are 51 mods

GME🚀🚀🚀
VALE🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The next great EV play is GME without the E, here me out 🚀 You might be thinking why is this retard shilling old ass dinosaur company $GM, this ain't your daddy left you in the middle of the night GM anymore.

**GM recently at CES showcased their vision to become a dominant EV player in this industry. They're going balls deep raw and betting everything on this clean energy future shit:**

* They announced a new division in GM called BrightDrop, where they'll produce electric vans for commercial delivery companies. Their first customer is FedEx and production will begin 2nd half of this year. This is not some fake ass partnership like with these other Spacs, it's the real fucking deal.
* GM CEO Mary Barra said they'll be investing $27 billion fucking tendies to develop EV's and automated technology over the next 5 years.
* GM said they expect to release 30 new EV models by 2025. I know some of you autistic fucks have reading comprehension problems, this mean WITHIN the next 5 years we'll get plenty of catalysts coming gradually.
* Their all-new modular platform and Ultium batteries: GM is partnering with LG Chem to make these low-cost and efficient batteries. Their expectations are up to 400 miles per charge with 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. They'll have energy ranges from 50 to more than 200kWh. Support for all-wheel applications. This gives them a shit ton of flexibility for a wide range of vehicles.
* GM's Ultium battery platform and powertrain is so great, that Japanese car manufacturer Honda has signed a deal with GM so they can build some of their EV's in the near future.
* Their first release EV is the newly designed Hummer which will come later this year. Lebron has been shilling it on his instagram

**GM has strong financials and an extremely undervalued valuation compared to their EV peers:**

* Their revenue last quarter was $35.47B, Tesla revenue was $8.77B, Nio revenue was $666 million. Put that into perspective relative to their valuations.
* GM already has solid cash flow, high-margins, a strong balance sheet. Which is a rarity compared to its EV competitors.
* GM is a cash cow and has the ability to outspend its competitors easily, while scaling quickly with their various number of factories.
* They'll be reinstating their dividend soon
* GM PE Ratio is 22.41, TSLA is 1,579.66, and others in the space even autistically higher

GM is not the next Tesla, but it has significant room to grow relative to its valuation as the company shifts to more EV future. It can quickly steal marketshare in the industry and scale fast to outpace their other competitors. GM is easily going over $70 and their options are dirt fucking cheap with great deltas.   


 Positions: 55c 02/19, 60c 03/19, 70c 03/19_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Movie theaters were dying before COVID, they’re not a good investment _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Coding Prodigy Behind Hit Game PUBG Eyes IPO Worth Billions - Gonna list in Korea.... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Confirmed With My Local Gamestops, Some Stores Are Going to Have Build-a-PC Capabilities I wanted to do my own research of u/ethandavid's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

I went to two Gamestops in my large metropolitan area. The first one, they confirmed that those type of stores are coming, but they are also changing some Gamestops to be more of a gaming lounge, where people can hang out and game. They mentioned the stores would also have snack and drinks to buy and some of the stores have already switched over to having that, but because of COVID they are very few of them.

The second Gamestop I visited happened to be one of the ten busiest Gamestops in the country (unrelated but they said they had a great holiday season). She also confirmed that the some stores are going to become what was described in u/ethandavid's post. Which is a place people can come in and an employee will work/walk them through the process of buying parts to build a PC. And parts will be sold at Gamestops.

She described the idea as being similar to what Microcenters' offer but the inverse. So they will still be mainly console gaming but have a small but good collection of PC parts and people knowledgeable about it. And those knowledgeable people will walk through people buying parts to build a PC. The goal is Summer 2021 for the switch to happen, but depending on COVID and vaccination rates it could be pushed to Fall 2021.

I did ask about Cohen being a CEO, and she said she did not know, but she would not be surprised if that happened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am incredibly bullish on this move as it is a niche that isn't really explored at a large scale. Microcenters offer something similar, but their footprint is really small. And Best Buy doesn't have a dedicated area or people for that. And it helps to somewhat insulate them from people moving to PC gaming as they can sell them the equipment they will need to game.

Last point that I do not see a lot of talk about is their collectables and TCG (Pokemon, Magic, etc). Real disposable income per capita in the U.S. has gone up by about 6 percent year-to-date from last year. Right now, it's on track to reach the fastest rate of growth since 1984. There are numerous reasons for that but the increase in federal unemplotment and the $1200 helped, along with most services being shut down, people used that money to buy goods such as collectables. One exampole is funk pops, which she mentioned sell very well and people constantly come into the store to purchase funko pops because they like to browse. People in store means people might buy other stuff outside of collectables. Another example is Pokemon cards, where the prices and demand for cards are fucking stupid crazy high, like prices going up 100s and even 1000s of % in the past 6 months alone. Going to a Target looking for Pokemon cards is like looking for TP at the beginning of the pandemic. Which leads to my point about TCG, Gamestop has a surprisingly decent card offering including exclusive products and offering preorders. She mentioned that people would come in and just buy all of the Pokemon cards and that they restock multiple times a DAY because demand is so high. Multiple desirable sets will be released this year, and people will go into Gamestops to preorder and might pick up something else while they are looking. 

The big point about the collectables is that people still like to browse for collectables driving people to the store, TCG cards like Pokemon drives people in to the store, and people will continue to collect even after the pandemic. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR Some Gamestops are soon going to be a hangout center and a place where people can build a PC/buy parts as soon as Summer 2021. Also their collectables aspect of their business model is underrated imho. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Ready for tendie town 🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's not much, but it's honest work 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gold Traders Wait for Yellen to Weigh In on Dollar and Stimulus. For those of you autistic enough to understand shiny rocks, this is for you. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Leadership wants the squeeze to happen. How we may be able to tell the top. Ryan Cohen is abundantly aware of the short squeeze potential. He had 2k twitter followers just a week ago. Who do you think he's tweeting to with emojis and gifs? Us. 

He can't come out and bluntly discuss all of this. The SEC would be on his ass. His lawyers have already made him delete a tweet that was just a picture about a roller coaster.

Imagine that shit. And now he tweets a 🥜 and retard at us. He is excited and literally can't contain it.

But that ain't what I'm here to talk about today.

The squeeze is going to happen. It is in GameStop's best interest for this squeeze to happen.

Y'all keep asking what is the optimal price target to exit. **No one fucking knows**. 

This is gonna go past $100. After that, I have no idea where it goes and no one else does either.

Remember [this shelf offering](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm) we learned about at the last earnings call?

The immediate reaction was bearish. The stock dipped. Our retardation was in question. Paper hands jumped ship because management was clearly too stupid to realize a squeeze was on the horizon.

Turns out, management ain't as stupid as you think they are.

**The optimal play for GameStop is to let us squeeze to the moon and then deploy the shelf offering at the top.**

It'll maximize tendies for all parties involved.

What does this mean for us?

The squeeze is coming because **EVERYONE BUT MELVIN** wants it to happen.

Imagine the news coverage GME would get from a historic short squeeze as it moves forward into a new Cohen World Order. GME wants this and prepared for this with their shelf offering.

**My advice:** I don't know if it will be possible, but keep track of all GME news and if news comes out that the shelf offering is being deployed, then I recommend selling. As that may signal the top.

**TL;DR:** Ryan Cohen and GME leadership know about the squeeze. This will trigger. They will deploy their shelf offering at the top. If you hear about it, sell to maximize tendies.

**Positions:** 3300 shares at $16. Loads of 35c 4/16 options.

Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in "Fate of the Furious" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA Bears _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “This is a Wall Street Bets market and you’re just living in it” Someone got that right 🚀 🚀 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some Whale Watching and Analysis: Week of 1/19 *This is long; I got lots of great questions after the whales 101 post so I’m trying to be thorough.

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I’d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I’ll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  
————————————

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)
**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)

**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22

**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES 

**Earnings Reports**: Mid February

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don’t like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you’re giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEP🚀🚀** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I’ll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he’s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FB🚀🚀**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They’ve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the "censorship" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN 🚀🚀🚀**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it’s hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment—or lack any treatment at all—then the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I’m trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

—————————-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I’m
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

*Go Bengals*._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shout Out To Us Making A Way 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Papa Elon sending us to Mars. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 [https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/elon-musk-swears-hell-send-140700880.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/elon-musk-swears-hell-send-140700880.html)

# Elon Musk Swears He'll Send Humans to Mars by 2026. That Seems Impossible.

**Caroline Delbert** 

 Mon, January 18, 2021, 9:07 AM 

 

At an awards ceremony this week, Elon Musk said he believes he can start [sending humans to Mars with SpaceX by 2026](https://www.space.com/spacex-launch-astronauts-mars-2024) at the latest, or 2024 “if we get lucky.”

Was Musk talking up his timeline to a group that just awarded him for innovation (the SpaceX founder won this year's [Axel Springer Award](https://axel-springer-award.com/)), or does he *actually* believe this? It's hard to say. But the timeline is, to put it mildly, unlikely.  


SpaceX has partnered with NASA on several projects, including making a customized lunar shuttle to travel between the moon’s orbit and surface for the Artemis series of missions. NASA’s Artemis program wants to [put people on the *moon* by 2024](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a29492598/congress-nasa-2024-moon-return/), and even that mission’s plans are called “an aggressive timeline” [by NASA administrators](https://www.inverse.com/science/artemis-schedule-moon-by-2024).

NASA says the moon goal is critical to the next phase of traveling to Mars, but the agency hasn’t set *any* timeline for that phase. The 2024 goal was [imposed from outside by Vice President Mike Pence](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/artemis_plan-20200921.pdf) (it was originally 2028).

In the meantime, the rocket Musk is relying on to get to Mars as soon as 2024 is about to [complete a big test](https://www.space.com/spacex-launch-astronauts-mars-2024). Later this week, SpaceX is set to launch SN8, its [latest Starship prototype](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a33596956/spacex-starship-prototypes-sn6-sn7-updates/), to a target altitude of 9 miles (15 kilometers)—easily the [highest a Starship has ever flown](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a33492601/spacex-starship-sn5-hop-test-watch-live/). SN8 has three engines, and that's still 27 fewer than the *30* engines that will power the Starship that Musk ultimately plans to send to Mars.  


Even with a capable spacecraft in hand, a lot of the problems with a Mars journey haven't even come close to being solved. The trip to Mars takes six months on Musk’s planned timeline, meaning anyone inside the ship will be exposed to cosmic radiation for almost that entire time.

Blocking—or even reducing—that radiation would mean adding weight to an already unproven craft on an untried human journey. Volunteers have spent that much time in simulated flight conditions, but no real people have actually made the real and dangerous journey.

So let’s say humans make the six-month trip with all the supplies they need, touch down on Mars, then immediately return to Earth. The ship will either need to have the full round trip worth of supplies or be able to refuel and restock using some kind of technology to recycle or harvest resources from what Mars has available.

This is easy in the world of science fiction, where creators have posited “matter recyclers” that make extremely clean, reusable atoms. In the real world, however, we can barely recycle plastic with efficiency.

And [Musk plans for these people to stay on Mars](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a33900282/elon-musk-says-settlers-will-die-on-mars/), not just travel. That means finding safe shelter that, again, protects the Mars settlers from cosmic radiation. They’ll need clean water, a way to produce energy, a *very* secure air supply and containment, and much more.

Musk has suggested [using a nuclear reactor](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a32064681/tiny-nuclear-reactors-propulsion-mars/) at several points in this journey, from on the ship itself to shorten the trip, to on the Red Planet’s surface as a generator. That, too, could have radioactive consequences for the settlers—but without it, it’s even harder to imagine how this situation can be made livable.

Musk seems to be relying on a combination of comparative optimism and techno-optimism. “Comparative optimism can be defined as a self-serving, asymmetric judgment of the future,” [researchers explain](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/abs/comparative-pessimism-or-optimism-depressed-mood-risktaking-social-utility-and-desirability/3828923C2C92A63E8D27CB0A0A76498D).

The term has come up in 2020 as people decide to go out without masks, have social gatherings that are against public health guidelines, and engage in other behaviors that fall under a general umbrella of “we’ll figure it out, it will be fine.”

It’s hard to imagine how the many and *major* obstacles between today and a human Mars flight will be resolved by 2026. But then again, Musk has proven everyone wrong before.

TLDR;

TSLA is going to  🚀  🚀  🚀 by 2026._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It all makes sense about Cramer now... if you’re seeing this buddy, don’t say we didn’t tell you so when GME hits $1,000 🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME Penultimate DD: Date of Launch to the Moon So, for you glorious retards, here is my ultimate DD for you. Do what you may with it.

**The what?**

* RC **will** add more shares to his portfolio **of his currant** 9,001,000 shares (appx. 12.9% of the firm).

**The when?**

* ***Earlier of***
   * 30 **calendar days** prior to the deadline for submission of stockholder nominations of director candidates for the Issuer’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders **OR**
   * 120 **calendar days** prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (the “Standstill Period”) i.e ***(appx. Feb 20, 2021)***

[Standstill Period \(page 4\)](https://preview.redd.it/70xfqg2407c61.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bb1eb54b7f245f728f42640ade7743c3720e79c)

But wait, there are even more interesting tit-bits in this agreement.

* RC Waived his rights for compensation. **BUT**
* Same rights to be given to new appointed directors (**stock compensation similar to previous directors)**

&#x200B;

[RC waives compensation \(page 8\)](https://preview.redd.it/10plifvu07c61.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eb382f009d830d42707403e8a5393dd84091113)

Additional agreements is where the fuckery begins,

* ***Affiliates are NOT affiliates?***
   * so the other directors (Jim Grub and Alan Atal) are **not considered part of RC ventures**.
      * It is possible that Alan and the Jim could possibly purchase the float under a separate entity and completely hoodwink the shorts.
      * They may have deep ITM options, waiting for the right time to exercise.
      * They may not, But the possibility of it happening gets me hard so I am including it.

[Affiliates shall not include company and its affiliates.\(Page 9\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ola0jsde17c61.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd7b2739d2ee37322c3b2a0790ae99a72a448a3)

**Buuuut didn't the agreement say he cannot acquire more before the standstill period has ended?**

* Well, **Yes but No**, You see, he will be **subject to restriction as an "interested stockholder"** for 3 years if he comes to beneficially own MORE THAN 20% of outstanding common stock.
* Since he is planning to stay in GME for long term, ideally it shouldn't matter to him if he is labelled as "Interested Stockholder" and effectively enters into a mandatory non-compete with GME for 3 years.

[Page 10](https://preview.redd.it/qheht2pn27c61.png?width=2100&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f7d487836715f6ddc0fcae0e19a5e522a2f425)

* Also, Board has approved his purchase of common share **UPTO 20% of outstanding common stock.**

[Page 13](https://preview.redd.it/gfaokokl37c61.png?width=2060&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a0d77aa23e9033ee674a051bc56eebe6c682d8)

&#x200B;

With the float already minuscule as compared the short interest, any news of further share acquisition by any member of the board will force the shorts to pimp themselves, their wives and pets out to pay for the shorts.

Squeeze can start before or after the standstill period is over, but when it starts will tell us about RC's commitment towards GME.

* If the news of further stock acquisition arrives before the standstill period, you can be more certain that buying back into GME will be well worth it.

Prepare for a very lengthy post. **I have worked my ASS off on this**.  Fair warning, this post is an update for my Nokia idea on TradingView,  so when I refer to Reddit/WSB I am talking to you guys as if you are  looking at it from my TradingView idea. 

&#x200B;

Since my original ideas on TV and social media, there have been quite a few very interesting developments. For once, I'm not going to do just chart analysis. I am also adding a large amount of due diligence regarding options activity, social media activity, news articles, and comparisons against competitors. Financials are something I am still struggling to learn but hopefully will eventually get there. As far as financials are concerned, I do know that their revenue is down overall but their profit margins have increased. As far as revenue is concerned, Nokia has been acquiring a large amount of contracts lately in the 5G sector. Nokia also has a very good debt to asset ratio when compared against pretty much the entire industry they're attempting to capture market share in.

&#x200B;

This will start off with some regular old chart analysis. Support and resistance levels, and candlestick and RSI analysis. Bollinger Bands are self explanitory for the most part.

&#x200B;

Let us start with a crucial RSI trend I discovered on the 2 month time frame.

Spanning from 2006, there has been a consistent trend of attempted breakouts upwards and above 50 RSI. Each breakout has been a lower high thus far. Currently, Nokia is contending with this 2 month RSI trend line for the 7th time. This is a MAJOR area of confluence when combined with MA's, Fib retracement levels, and reactions in candlesticks.

https://preview.redd.it/xuobh6uor6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=580ba82ee3642e4332e1745ade50039ffc869939

&#x200B;

On the monthly, we can see that this trend line coincided with a major selloff in October of 2019. This selloff was caused by a bad earnings report on 10/24/2019. Earnings were estimated to be $0.05 but reported $0.01 which had a -69.42% surprise of -$0.04. Prior to this, the month of August broke down below this trend line. During the month of September, Nokia attempted to rally back above it on low volume. The local support level it was testing at $5.18 or the 0.5 Fib retracement flipped to resistance and caused a 27.87% drop after the bad earnings report. It was not until the month of June 2020 that Nokia was able to get back above this trend line. 2 months later, Nokia tested that same resistance level and was able to get above 50 RSI, but was strongly rejected. This rejection dropped Nokia back below the RSI trend line, but it was able to hold support at 40 RSI. The month of November 2020 however had a bullish engulfing candle to bring Nokia back above the trend line. Then the month of October 2020 had low sell volume and thus held as support. For this particular trend line, support has not been tested successfully like this since July of 2018. Note however, that the mid line of the bollinger bands is so far holding as resistance.

&#x200B;

Notice the giant bearish hammer the lower arrow is pointing to. That was the market-wide covid selloff of March 2020 and it closed directly at the 0.786 Fib retracement. There was strong bullish support residing at the 0.886 Fib retracement which not only caused the large wick, but strongly pushed Nokia back up and into the 20 year trend line zone of support. Since December of 2017, Nokia's price movement has been unable to close a monthly candle below this trend line. In October of 2020, Nokia once again successfully tested the 0.786 Fib retracement for support which coincided perfectly with the 20 year trend line and a diagonal trend line breakout.

https://preview.redd.it/giukvukpr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=613407c999d8e004c84d2943f562a04ef3ade19c

&#x200B;

The 2 month trend line also translates very well to the daily, where we can see that Nokia has successfully tested this trend line multiple times for support throughout 2020.

Since 12/21/2020, Nokia has so far successfully tested this support on this time frame. According to the trend, this \*should\* produce at least some upwards movement to test local resistance levels. Namely, the 0.618 Fib level at $4.34.

https://preview.redd.it/yad5hm4qr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=b681b860cd1ad96f5260dcbd921187bfb59c1ba1

&#x200B;

According to the 3 month time frame, Nokia has \*serious\* support below the $tree fiddy price point, and 40 RSI. The October 2016 3 month candle tested 40 RSI and had a fairly strong bounce. Then a year later, same thing. From that point forward, this zone was not tested until the negative October 2019 earnings report pushed Nokia well below it. Then in April 2020, Nokia had a high volume bullish engulfing candle that brought the RSI back above 40 but was rejected at the 0.618 Fib retracement. After that 3 month candle closed in July, Nokia spent the next 6 months testing support. Bears were unable to close the next 2 candles below 40 RSI AND the 20 year trend line. The October 2020 3 month candle closed as a long legged doji on high volume indicating strong buyer support. This is a multitude of confluence that shows for the next 3 months at least, Nokia should have strong buying support.

https://preview.redd.it/tfl8spoqr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a82eb96ac9bb40322fcd96a849d7b81c566f72

&#x200B;

Now is time for perhaps one of the most interesting clues as far as Nokia's price action, the 6 month time frame.

The 6 month candle starting on January 2nd, 2020 is one of the strongest indicators that Nokia is soon to have some serious volatility.

It closed as a bullish hammer with very long tail and short upper shadow. This indicates buying support stepped in and held the line in a big way towards the end of the candle close. Volumes for this candle are the highest they have been since the giant hulk dildo starting in July of 2013.

The very next candle after this bullish hammer was a bearish spinning top doji- but was able to close WITHIN the body of the bullish hammer. This type of doji can indicate the beginning of a shift in sentiment, or a 'pause'. This 'pause' does sometimes precede a resumption of the prior trend. Considering the volumes in these 2 candles, Nokia is likely to experience serious volatility over the next 6 months. It is a very good sign though in my opinion that this doji candle closed within the body of the bullish hammer. The RSI however is pointing out a break of support, and subsequent confirmation of resistance. Nokia needs to break back above 45 RSI on this time frame in order to establish strong bullish bias.

https://preview.redd.it/mzv9hb6rr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d86440e0fba694083f58982c61ee810a8b79a7

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Support is hodling but this is arguably the most important zone to decide Nokia's short, mid, and long term fate.

Immediate support levels: $3.80, $3.70, $3.50.

Lower support levels: $3.15, $2.44, and ALL-IN anything below that.

&#x200B;

Immediate resistance levels: $4.30, $4.50, $5.

I happened to find a website to check historical data on options volumes and open interest. The position I currently hold are $7 call contracts expiring on 1/21/2022, so I decided to take a look at the data for them.

I also checked the $10 call contracts with the same expiration as they currently have what seems to be the largest amount of open interest.

&#x200B;

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.

Between the end of December and January 4th, there were very slight fluctuations in the open interest, yet the volumes traded were above average.

Note that on January 5th and 6th, the volumes skyrocketed while open interest decreased. Strange considering the premium price of the options were on a slight upwards trend from that date. After January 6th, however, the the volume was mostly flat/average while the open interest significantly increased. January 15th, open interest skyrocketed. Interesting to note that this increase came after a significantly high volume day in shares.

&#x200B;

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call. Unfortunately, without paying for a subscription this website only allows you to see historical data spanning roughly 3 months.

Still, this screenshot shows multiple significant trends in the options for this particular contract.

The first thing that obviously catches the eye is the enormous volume and drop in option premium price/open interest that happened right before November. On October 29th, Nokia released an earnings report. This particular report showed an expected earnings per share of $0.06, but the actual reported earnings per share were $0.04, which was a surprise of -$0.02 or -36.37%. As of the opening bell for trading, Nokia dropped by 18.99% in 1 hour, eventually bottoming out at $3.21 a few hours later after a 20.72% decline in share price. After this 'cleanse', the $7 call option mostly traded flat for another 12 days thereafter. On the 13th day, open interest began rising again. Currently, Nokia's $7 call 1/21/22 contract has an open interest of roughly 135,000 contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/vy82mmstr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37840bae667ba18c238536ad190d79240daaf38

&#x200B;

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

Unlike the strange activity in the $7 call, the overall trend for the open interest in the $10 call has only been upwards since the 17th of December onwards. Volumes have mostly been flat up until the 14th when Nokia had a very high volume day in shares. Otherwise, open interest and volumes in this contract have not had anything major to really report on other than a steady increase in open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/0mk1qbsur6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb533c845998c0ab2f41060e7fb6140c4bf5c4f

&#x200B;

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

This screenshot is quite interesting. There have been multiple high volume days for this option, but the one that specifically stands out was when the contract bottomed out at $0.08. From that point forward, open interest and volumes remained relatively flat. Notice that in the latter part of November, the high volume days preceeded a significant decline in the option premium price. From the peak option price premium of \~$0.16 however, the open interest only increased unlike what happened with the $7 call option on October 29th for earnings. The highest volume days for this contract in the timeline that I have to work with were, interestingly, the 14th and the 15th. This could signal another significant decline in premium price, or it could be a signal that Nokia's share price may be in the beginning stages of a rally. Considering historical data, history indicates that this \*\*should\*\* unfortunately be a signal for a drop in premium price. Whales love to mess with the noobs.

&#x200B;

This is a screenshot that represents the grand total of all options traded versus share price.

For months, the options volume and stock volume have remained relatively flat until the 14th and 15th.

Implied volatility as well as volumes are signaling there is likely to be a major move within the next few trading sessions.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Options Open Interest is skyrocketing. $7c has weird stuff going on but $10c is stronger than a held-in beer fart.

On the other hand, the amount of open interest in the $7 and $10 calls could very easily be used to create significant bearish options pressure.

Kevin Stine, \*\*Chief\*\* of the Applied Cybersecurity Division at \*\*NIST\*\*, said: “5G will touch every aspect of our lives and security must be integrated up front rather than an add-on element of 5G networks. We’re looking forward to working with our project collaborators such as Nokia to show 5G’s advanced standards based security features as well an architecture that leverages foundational security capabilities available in cloud technologies.”

&#x200B;

Raghav Sahgal, President, Cloud and Network Services at Nokia, said: “Previous cellular technology generations have been industry-led whereas 5G development must evolve in collaboration with governments to ensure availability and access of secure trusted networks. The 5G Cybersecurity Project fills this role with a cross-section of government and industry collaborators on board. At Nokia, we embed security into every solution that we ship, and we are committed to enabling the secure shift to the cloud by working with government agencies and the industry to advance cybersecurity for 5G use cases that leverage both open and commercial components.”

Do yourself a favor. GOOGLE "What is Zacks Ranking"

Zacks ranking rates a stock on a scale from 1-5. 1 Being a strong buy while 5 is a strong sell.

"The Zacks Rank is a short-term stock recommendation of 1-3 months that is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions. It is designed to weed out the companies with rising earnings estimates.

... Remember, the Zacks Rank is generated daily."

&#x200B;

"People also ask: Is Zacks a good rank?"

"Since 1988, Zacks #1 Rank stocks have generated an annualized return of 25.67%, nearly three times better than the S&P 500's return of 10.79%. The Zacks Rank has also been very successful in telling investors which stocks to avoid. Since 1988, Zacks #5 Rank stocks have been flat.."

&#x200B;

Zacks basically states that Nokia is worthwhile with solid fundamentals and ranks Nokia a 3, or "Hold".

To comprise this ranking, however, Zacks evaluates a stock on 4 different areas. Value, Growth, Momentum, and an averaged score of all 3.

This particular evaluation is graded like a report card in school: A, B, C, D, or the big fat red F.

As far as the average Value, Growth, and Momentum score is concerned, Nokia gets an A:

https://preview.redd.it/7rt8d4mms6c61.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f84ab111c518ae617c133144bd68af27111d1d4

&#x200B;

As far as Nokia being ranked a 3, or "Hold" rating:

"Zacks #3 Rank Stocks Can Be Perfectly Acceptable. 

I bet that title attracted your attention. You most likely have heard us refer to stocks with a Zacks #1 Rank as being the “cream of the crop.” It is understandable why. These stocks represent the top 5% of all stocks that are covered by at least one analyst and are expected to experience the strongest earnings estimate revisions in the future."

[https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-](https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-)

&#x200B;

I'll admit, I haven't looked into the above claim of #1 rankings hitting 25.67% annualized returns. I am only adding Zacks ranking here for analytical and historical purposes.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Zacks rank says to hold, as it could go up or down, but gives Nokia a "Grade A" rating for value, growth, and momentum potential.

Social Media is by far my favorite trading 'indicator', because of how funny human behavior and psychology can be.

It is absolutely in my opinion one of the most underutilized tools a person can have in their analysis arsenal.

When you were a kid and someone told you "I bet you can't throw this rock farther than me!", what did you do?

Or how about as a kid, your closest friend/friends always told you that you'd never beat their high score in video games.

To this day, when someone or especially multiple people try to tell you that you cannot do/achieve something, what do you try to do?

Or how about today, where a very large Social Media sentiment is that Nokia is a complete waste of time?

The float of 5.6 billion outstanding shares is too high, there's absolutely no way the price can move!

Or what about all the people that had too strong of hands and didn't cut their losses much earlier on?

All those people trashing Nokia's name? Saying they can't do something? They won't move? Flatter than a pancake?

&#x200B;

I have noticed that within the past few weeks, there has been a significant uptick in posts regarding Nokia on the first and third largest investing forums Reddit has. Their names? /r/Wallstreetbets and /r/Stocks.

Currently, /r/Wallstreetbets has the largest following of 1.9 million members, /r/Investing comes in 2nd at 1.3 million members, and the third largest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Stocks and it has 1.1 million members.

Take a look around on Wallstreetbets and you will quickly realize that forum can legitimately move the market. No joke.

Teh stocks forum is far more conservative than the WSB one, yet, Nokia is still popping up quite frequently these past couple weeks in both.

Interesting to note however that the second biggest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Investing, and it has ZERO posts about Nokia since 12/08/20. That post didn't even garner a single reply. Hmm.. Weird.

&#x200B;

"This fat boy ain’t moving (yet)"

"I bought some $5 and $7 calls for 2023 so i hope you're right, with 5 billion float it'll probably never get there but it wasn't too expensive for some lottery tickets"

&#x200B;

What is my point here? What angle am I getting at? H Y P E. How do you create serious hype/FOMO for a stock in todays world? It needs some sort of 'reputation'. A very negative one is best. Why?

Nokia is known for having a giant outstanding share supply. They're known for being in a decades long downtrend. They're known for not being worth investing in, plain and simple.

So, back to human behavior. If you look back at the past year ish or so of comments on social media regarding Nokia, the stock has built quite the negative reputation.

&#x200B;

You NEVER hear about Nokia. You never see it in the news. You never hear its name anymore other than when people reminisce of the good old days- where products were ackshually built to last!

You don't see the Nokia brand anywhere anymore.. Its name doesn't show up on TV, or in the newspaper, or on ticker news feeds, nothing. Nowhere. Nada. Zilch.

What would happen if, say, Nokia suddenly had a +50% day out of nowhere? EVERYONE who ever doubted Nokia or even heard their name are quickly reminded that they are still alive.

These people are seemingly  so brainwashed at this point that Nokia is not a worthwhile investment, they don't even bother. Even though it just rocketed 50%. Meh, just a dead cat bounce. 

Nah, they'll stay out and chase their gains in PLTR or GME or BB or whatever the current meme stocks are for the day.

Next day, Nokia rockets again while maybe other meme/blue chip stocks and/or indexes are flat or negative. See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

THE very M O M E N T Nokia rips a hulk dildo on the chart, everyone and their mother is going to know about it.

Meh, just a dead cat bounce. Right guys? ...Right?

Then it goes up. Again. While a lot of people including I/you were waiting for a pullback.

See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

STRICTLY because of Nokia's reputation and the extreme negative sentiment surrounding it in Social Media, this is a perfect play.

When it finally rips loose, everyone and their brother is going to be waiting for a pullback. What if it doesn't come soon enough?

Imagine the FOMO.

A multi decade long downtrend is clearly reversing. You can see it in the chart, trend lines, and in the sentiment. This was rock bottom.

\*\*TLDR: Imagine the FOMO.

Google Trends can be a fun 'indicator' of sorts to use. It doesn't necessarily mean anything, BUT, it can yield an interesting metric.

How outright BORING something is or isn't.

How UNDERAPPRECIATED something is or isn't.

How many people would choose to talk about anything BUT ... that.

How .. dare I say, \*\*undervalued\*\* something is? Or how popular something is? lolNokia.

&#x200B;

When you think of Nokia, what is the first thing you think of? For me, it is those damn 3310 phone models. The ones that just .. wouldn't die. No matter what you did to them. 

At this point, Nokia has apparently upgraded its appetite. Let's face it. In todays world of \*\*planned obsolescence\*\* especially in the smartphone world, Nokia doesn't stand a chance because of how many competitors it has!

\-This is a 17 year chart from Google Trends.

12/2011 - 01/11. Nokia absolutely TANKS in relevance. I wonder why?

01/2016. Nokia suddenly for the most part flatlines after a decent drop.

If we compare this to a heart beat monitor, Nokia's relevancy is \[still\] legit dead. 

Dead. Not coming back. Can't start, won't start, NOStart. OD'D and narcan can't save it.

From that 6.7% positive earnings report? Nokia \*\*tanks\*\*, AGAIN, only this time -84.72%. Yep. You saw that right.

I wonder if the bear flag had anything to do with it, though?

&#x200B;

Lastly, I would just like to address the echo chambered and (in MY opinion) incorrect opinion of how Nokia cannot move well or quickly in price because of what I will call "The Float Fallacy."

Nokia has a grand total of 5.6 billion shares that make up the company, otherwise known as "The Float". Nokia has a market cap currently of $22.1B.

That means when you multiply the total supply of tradable shares to how much money they each are trading for, you get the total overall valuation of a company.

The majority opinion everywhere on Nokia above all else, is that it cannot move due to its float size. Essentially, people are arguing that you'd need to buy substantially more shares

in order to move the price than you would a different company. While this is generally true, the AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADED STAYS THE SAME.

&#x200B;

To give you an idea of why the float doesn't matter, we can compare Nokia's market cap to the market cap sizes and share values of other competitors.

First example I will use is Ericsson. Ericsson has a market cap of $36.13B. Their share price is currently $11.76. Now, again, think about the MONEY, not the shares.

Say I wanted to invest $100 in a given stock. I could buy 8.5 shares in total of Ericsson. Or, I could get 24.5 shares of Nokia for THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.

What sounds more appealing to you? Owning 8.5 shares in a company, or nearly 3 times as much?

&#x200B;

So let's compare market cap sizes with a few competitors to see just how much growth potential Nokia truly has.

We will just use the major companies listed alongside Nokia on the U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.

&#x200B;

AT&T

Market cap: $207.87B

Share price: $29.17

Float: 7.13B

&#x200B;

Cisco

Market cap: $191.97B

Share price: $45.43

Float: 4.22B

&#x200B;

Dell

Market cap: $55.68B

Share price: $74.26

Float: 0.77B

&#x200B;

Intel

Market cap: $235.96B

Share price: $57.58

Float: 4.1B

&#x200B;

T-Mobile

Market cap: $157.98B

Share price: $127.28

Float: 1.24B

&#x200B;

These figures show the valuation that Nokia can and will eventually hit.

The only real negative effect of having 5.6 billion outstanding shares is that it can take a while for them to become more widely dispersed rather than overconcentrated.

Meaning a very select few absurdly rich people can and have been suppressing the price. The more they do it though, the more insane opportunities it gives you. That's the entire point.

So, in a way, float does matter, but that is EXACTLY WHY this is such a winning proposition. The more shares WE buy, the less THEY have and can control.

 

anddd, I'm done. Finally. This is my  very last update regarding Nokia until $0.20 is no longer a gigantic  movement.

Shoutout to John. I just wanna help people too. Seems like I'm apparently doing it wrong but idk.

A guide to the paperhanded included. So you know how the market has been edging up without a large retrace ever since the November lows? A lot of this has been linked to vaccine hopes and huge amount of cash looking for tendies. Crucially, it's also linked to huge volumes of call options being bought. If a dealer/market maker (MM) sells you calls, he wants to keep the tendies without taking any risk. So to hedge the risk of selling the calls and seeing the underlying rise, he needs to hedge his risk by buying the underlying (either stocks or index futures). The # of shares he needs to buy depends on the gamma - gamma is higher when the stock price moves closer to the strike price.

If call volume increase, dealer buying of the underlying stocks also increases, further lifting the stocks. This is basically what wsb used to be about before Melvin restricted rocket rides to shares only. 

**Much words, few points, you say.** Getting to it. So what happens if a factor that has been supporting the markets suddenly weakens or completely reverses? A bear move doesn't need a lot of sellers, it just needs a lack of buying at current levels, a small correction. Dealers unwinding their positions would add to the sales and we could see a fast plunge. Add to that the record amount margin loans and you have quite the laxative cocktail. This could be ugly as fuck.

I'm eyeing the area of 3244 - 3300 on $SPX as an area of ultimate support. A massive amount of stops are sitting below that area - it's a double bottom formed in September and November. A quick plunge below these levels would probably be short lived as it would most likely be stop hunting. I don't want to tie up too much of my capital on expensive SPY puts, so I'll be looking to get some IWM puts or maybe some gourd shorts. 

**Wait, but what about BB, GME, PLTR?** The above is based on the S&P500 and options flows. A short squeeze doesn't need permission from the index or Melvin. Individual stocks don't need to follow the index 1 to 1 if there are other supporting factors. In any case, I'd be looking to add to GME in case of any pullbacks (I'm holding 100 shares of GME $19.94 + 1/21/22 10c $BB). **The fact is, corrections are common and they happen when the least amount of people expect it (**judging by the downvotes posts like these get in the last week I'd say it started on Friday). **Do not 📜 👐 your position just because of a correction. It will pass but your regrets won't once the correction is over and you see your positions mooning. Be ready for it, anticipate it. Have a plan.**

Didn't add any crayon drawings, but you can check the put to call drawings in a lot of places.

This is probably going to get downvoted to hell, but what the hell.

I am a palantir autist, aka, i've actually used foundry for 2-3 years at old workplace. I thought I'd write a piece to explain technically what it does, so you can feel more comfortable holding the bags and continue your confirmation bias.

# What is Foundry?

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&#x200B;

[Palantir Ontology](https://preview.redd.it/g4dubmm6m6c61.jpg?width=1285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28d1c6e899e6ee6e505d6359ba0d73e48c7926ff)

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like "Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your "I have all data in one view" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click > INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

Position: 350 shares at $30 diamond hands.  🚀🚀🚀

Edit: 3 x Rockets because on Blind, Palantir employees think the share price will hit $90 EoY rofl.

On the Jan 14th episode of Mad Money he said “Like it or not, right now we’ve got a bull market in short busting, and I bet you’ll see more stories like GameStop and Bed Bath.”

So, that kinda begs the question, “What next?” I’m sure many of you have already been combing the web, looking for other stocks that might be ready to squeeze, but the problem is that most stocks that attract a lot of short interest, are legitimately shitty businesses without much of a future. However, there are some stocks out there that more than make up for their poor revenues and laggard business models in pure untapped MEMABILITY.

I submit for your consideration the ticker TR. The iconic Tootsie Roll has been around since 1896, but it appears they have now fallen out of favor with Wall Street. They currently have a short percent of float of 45.87%. So, are we gonna let those hedge fund managers short this iconic American company into the ground? No, we are going to focus our retarded hive mind and buy shares of TR! Then, we are going to go to our local corner stores and load up on Sugar Babies, Fluffy Stuff, Nik-L-Nips, and of course Tootsie Rolls. Strap in tight, cuz when this thing squeezes, it’s gonna rocket to Candyland.

After a stratospheric year, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is ready to take it a step further: Into gourds.

The New York-based firm is planning to launch the ARK Agricultural Exploration ETF (ticker ARKZ), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed exchange-traded fund will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in gourd harvesting, and related agricultural commodities. 

After massive inflows over the past year, the once-niche firm now oversees about $41.5 billion in ETF products, compared with less than $3.5 billion in the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ark recently became a [top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/cathie-wood-s-ark-joins-top-10-etf-giants-with-tesla-heavy-fund)\-10 ETF issuer, thanks in large part to its $21.6 billion flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that has [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) as its biggest holding. While the vast majority of ETFs passively track indexes of stocks, Ark offers five actively managed U.S. ETFs, and Wood runs all of them.

Rumor that Ryan Cohen unfollowed CNBC on twitter (can anyone confirm if he was following them recently?). Fuck Cramer ahahahahaha._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why MRO is the new GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 OK degenerates, listen up. I've been doing some research on oil and I'm certain that MRO is STUPIDLY undervalued the same way Gamestop was back in August. Here's my DD:

First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. 

For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020.

Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. 

Idiots will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. 

Furthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops.

Full disclosure I am an autistic retard genius. Alright enough bragging lets get to it.

BCRX an amazingly not so amazing company doing amazing things. As you can see above that is a botched lip job aka HAE(Hereditary Angioedema) attack. Now I know what you're thinking, why is this guy showing us this big lip beauty and what does it have to do with BCRX. This is where things get interesting. Back in December this beautiful company received FDA approval for Orlayedo. "WtF iS oRlAyEdO??" Orlayedo my fellow autists is the first ever pill for HAE attacks. Before BCRX's Orlaydeo these guys were injecting HAE juice into their veins like heroine addicts(refer to image below).

"So HoW dOeS tHiS HeLp Me MaKe TeNdIeS??" Relax I'll explain it so even you less intelligent autists can understand. The current diagnosed market is 9000 patients in the US. They teamed with a bunch of those guys in the white coats to get the message out. Well those white coat guys got 1300 patients for HAE that they currently prescribe HAE juice injections(see image above). "HeLlO i StIlL dOn'T sEe Tendies??" Keep calm what you're about to read next is mind blowingly autistic. These devious fucks over at BCRX designed a system to royally fuck these insurance companies out of all their tendies resulting in big green dildos on our Robinhood charts. THESE FUCKS CHARGE 485,000 FOR A YEAR SUPPLY OF ORLAYEDO! Yes you read that correctly 485k a year per patient.

"HoLy TeNdIeS!!!" Put it back in your pants bucko because there is more! This drug is scheduled for approval in japan(2500 patients) and EU(probably a lot more than japan)The Japan approval will trigger a $20,000,000 milestone payment to BCRX from it's Japanese partner Torii Pharma. Alright alright by this point we're all horny as fuck for these tendies. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg like I've heard some fellow autists say. Their real money maker is Factor D. I'm no longer bored enough to continue on but if this gets some popularity I might drop some Factor D DD.
