 How to value companies Hi so I have been investing for a while I was wondering how do you guys value a company 

Like how would you value a growth stock

How would you value a value stock

I have tried lots of different methods then Ben Graham method is a good one but that's only for value stocks it would not work on growth stock like your Amazon's Facebooks and so on.... 



Valuations have been gone up so it's good to know how you would value a company

Do you guys have some sort of graphs or a calculator or what most people have is a spread sheet I have seen lots of YouTubers with their own methods

Iam mostly looking for a way to value growth stocks does anyone have a Google sheets you could show me_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why diversify more than the S&P500? Does a retirement portfolio need even more global exposure than the S&P500 provides? I read that in 2018, 42% of the revenues from companies in the S&P500 came from foreign countries. It seems that these US companies have a fair amount of global exposure already. What are your thoughts?

I bought BCLI at around $10 prior to a drug announcement for their ALS treatment study results.  I found out about the stock from a post on here.

Anyone else holding this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lemonade Insurance: A Full Blown Bubble? Let me start by saying that I believe in / understand thematic investing... I work in Venture Capital and am doing well at it.

Lemonade caught my attention because I summarized the S1 in details at IPO, for my personal learning. The S1 specifically states that because of reinsurance - gross margin for the business is stuck closely around 20% (reinsurance basically provides a floor but also caps potential profit if loss ratios come down).

Now - take a quick look at Bloomberg consensus. The company trades at 53x EV / 2022E Consensus Revenue as of tonight (yes, 53x FORWARD revenue)

If we put a 20% gross margin on this revenue (because of reinsurance there is virtually no chance the company significantly exceeds that!) the company basically trades at 250x EV / 2022 Gross Profit.

TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES 2022E (normalised) GROSS PROFIT.

I am speechless that the Motley Fool can recommend such a stock to its customers. This is beyond a bubble, in my view of course - but no one will change my mind here. My personal opinion is that this is bound to end badly in the next 2y (bar acquisition scenario, but I don’t see who would fork out 100x 2020 revenue for that business). Can anyone give me a valid reason not to go short, beyond the market’s current state?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in privately held stocks? Hi Guys - I'm 45 and divorced.  My income is more constrained these days due to the fact that I have kids.  So, I'm looking for ways to maximize the amount of return I'm getting for the amount of risk I'm taking.  

When do you guys think its okay to start investing in privately held stocks?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Whole life insurance vs bonds/treasuries Some background first: I [mid-30s] already max out my various retirement accounts, so the rest of my money goes into taxable accounts. I have a whole life insurance policy that my parents started for me decades ago. I'm debating between having NYL buy up the policy from my current provider, since they can give me a *much* better policy with an explicit end date on premiums and decent cash value growth, versus putting those premiums towards my portfolio (90-10 stock-bond).

Now, let's ignore the stock portion of my portfolio (which I know will likely have better long term returns), and compare it to the bond portion instead, since the (lower) yields and risk profiles are similar (correct me if I'm wrong there). We get the following when compared to other low risk vehicles:

Fund | 20 Year Annualized Return | 30 Year Annualized RoR | Guaranteed
---|---|----|----
BND | 4.55% | 5.65% | no, historical
NYL (Cash Value) | 1.68% (3.25%) | 2.17% (5.84%) | yes (non-guaranteed historical in parentheses)
NYL (Death Benefit) | 6.93% (8.47%) | 4.57% (6.23%) | yes (non-guaranteed historical)
Series I Bond | 5.6% | ?? | no, but ~2% inflation guaranteed
Series EE Bond | 3.53% (3.82%) | 4.86% | 2x guaranteed at 20 years (non-guaranteed historical)
Treasuries | 1.46% | 1.66% | no (?)

The guaranteed cash value is based on the reserves that NYL supposedly keeps to pay out policies in case of total bankruptcy, while the non-guaranteed rates are based on their historical dividend payout rates going back to the mid (early?) 1900s.

Going by these returns, allocating a portion of bond portfolio towards whole life doesn't actually seem like that bad an idea, does it? Guaranteed rates are better than current treasuries yields, and the non-guaranteed is comparable to the non-guaranteed returns of BND, but admittedly, not as good as the guaranteed return of the series EE bond (if we're just talking cash value)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Realized Losses I own 60 shares of Company Z with long term unrealized capital loss of $15,000.

I'll be brief, but I see commodities as a very undervalued asset class for a few reasons...

&#x200B;

It seems like President-elect Biden has no plans on slowing spending once he takes office. Additional stimulus, student debt relief, combined with continued spending by the FED is leading me to think that inflation rates are going to skyrocket. We've seen bitcoin surge, and even Treasury Bond yields are beginning to rise. The FED has said they're going to keep rock bottom rates for the foreseeable future, but I sense that is going to change given the economy's ability to rebound so quickly.

&#x200B;

I understand that stocks seem to be the only play right now given all other routes don't provide enough return to even warrant the thought of looking elsewhere, but am I wrong to assume that inflation is going to catch up, and catch up hard causing commodity price increases...

Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airlines are an interesting covid recovery play Airlines, as we know, was one of the most affected sectors from Covid. But hey at least we have a vaccine available right? 

Well it'll take a while for most of us to receive one, probably looking at March for most vulnerable to be in the process of getting one. Well that's actually okay for this play.

What other big event is going to happen this year apart from getting a vaccine? A pretty free summer for people to jet off to destinations they have always wanted to go to but never thought about it. Being under lockdown has meant a lot of people have been dreaming about going somewhere they've always wanted (personally it's Egypt) and they will make sure they book a holiday as soon as they know they're getting a vaccine right? 

Will money matter? Well not really since this will be many people's big holiday and they will want to splash the cash. Would you care if an airline ticket was an extra $100 dollars if it meant you could go and enjoy the beach somewhere instead of being cooped up in your home?

I'm not going to bore you with masses of ratios because you know airlines are mostly way off their 52 week highs and therefore have a lot of potential to make up.

Yes I know they won't be recovering to pre pandemic levels but they will have such a strong recovery once the green light has been given. 

Definitely a long term play, at least 6 months maybe longer, but can be a really good way to reap those untapped covid recovery returns.

TLDR: people wanting holidays after covid will make airlines soar_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Intelligent Investor Question - Please Explain Assume that Investor A buys some open-end shares at 109% of asset value, and Investor B buys closed-end shares at 85% thereof, plus 1 1⁄2% commission. Both sets of shares earn and pay 30% of this asset value in, say, four years, and end up with the same value as at the beginning. Investor A redeems his shares at 100% of value, losing the 9% premium he paid. His overall return for the period is 30% less 9%, or 21% on asset value. This, in turn, is 19% on his investment. How much must Investor B realize on his closed-end shares to obtain the same return on his investment as Investor A? The answer is 73%, or a discount of 27% from asset value. In other words, the closed-end man could suffer a widening of 12 points in the market discount (about double) before his return would get down to that of the open-end investor.


How is the answer 73%. Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone else seen these kinds of AI/Bot-driven website reports on stocks/companies of interest? [MicroVision, Inc.

I'm curious if anyone else has run across these sites (or sites like them/affiliated with them). These were picked up on a google alert for Microvision ($MVIS) but I'm certain if you plug in any ticker symbol into a google alert you'll find similar results.  Both articles were published on the same day. I went back and looked through past alerts and found an alarming amount of similar, near-duplicate results, all written in a very similar format  appearing on pseudo-professional investor newsletter sites. 

Keep in mind, there's nothing in the articles that's inaccurate. Quite the opposite actually. everything in the article is 100% factual.  It's the way the information is presented the same exact way every single time. It doesn't take a wizard to see that they're either using a template or some other means of pulling in current and recent historical data that's then extrapolated to formulate one of a hand-full of conclusions about said company. 

While I won't completely discount the recommendations the "writers" are making, I'm simply putting this out there for those who may have not been exposed to these before and mistakenly rely too heavily on the voracity of the information and recommendations they receive.  If i had to guess, it seems like whomever is publishing these is pushing out two versions - one more positive and the other more negative, hoping to capitalize on readers' confirmation bias and be viewed as a credible source. Alternatively, if these are written by actual people, then I have some serious concerns about their ability to communicate and provide strong analysis.

I often use [Morningstar.com](https://Morningstar.com) to research different equities and even bond etfs/funds.  When I do so, they have 3-yr, 5yr- and 10yr data that gives me the assets alpha, beta, r2, and sharp ratio against what ever index the asset generally is supposed to be comparable to.

For instance, for SPY the calculation benchmark they use to calculate the A, B, r2, and sharp ratio is the S&P 500.  And it's r2 is 100% which makes sense. 

But does anyone know of a website or tool I can use to compare SPY against something like the Russell 2000 index or something else?

I started my freelance career on Upwork because a family member suggested it. I found a few of my biggest clients on the site. I think Upwork has the potential to kill it in the WFH sector in the coming years, simply because they have been so focused on making a platform for large companies to come and find work. I bought the company stock earlier in 2020 (well, I bought at the IPO, sold, and bought again).

The stock has killed it since then, and I've made more on the investment than I have on the platform (still a top-rated freelancer even though I barely use it).

HOWEVER, I think Upwork's fatal flaw is their inability to keep people from moving off-platform for payments. There is absolutely no way for the company to know if a client or the freelancer move off-site after an initial contract is completed. From what I understand, all communication needs to stay on-site until a contract is started now. Okay, but then you can move off-platform for communication. Then there's the inevitable discussion of "Hey, do you have PayPal?" or "Let's move you onto our company bill-pay system." All that has to be done is end the contract as a successful completion on Upwork and they're now separated and working off-site.

This happens ALL the time, and I can see why. Even PayPal fees are less than UW's percentage, even if it moves into the 10% and 5% range.

Of course, there are the lowest bidders driving down everyone's rates on the site. There are also scammers. I found someone on there using my entire profile bio, word-for-word (reported it, taken down).

For example, in 2020, I "beat the market" because I made large purchases in March and April when the market was low due to covid, but the stocks I purchased gained \~50% from the time of purchase, lagging the S&P's \~70% rebound. 

Do you believe it is more prudent to compare returns at the time of purchase rather than on an annualized basis, and do you believe comparing at time of purchase helps in accounting for luck when it comes to indexing vs buying individual shares?

The reason I ask these questions is that I would have better returns by buying an index in some of those years where I made purchases because I saw value. Even though I waited until I saw value in certain companies and not in the overall index, the market believed there was more value in the companies I did not pick as the market returned more from that point on._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ is investing in IPOs always a losing prospect? With a large of amount of tech IPOs over the last few months and with the Coinbase IPO coming up (I'm personally interested in it, same with the robinhood IPO). I have been looking for research on IPO theory and any academically supported trading strategies when I came across this article:

"There always seems to be a relatively steady stream of IPOs ripe for investors to be taking advantage of possibly huge gains – or huge losses. IPOs are sometimes seen as attractive to investors because they can get in on nearly the ground floor of when a firm open’s its doors to the broader market. But the question is if this is generally a good thing for investors to do, invest in IPOs or don’t invest.

What is an IPO?

First, we should answer what an IPO stands for – it stands for initial public offering. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public with a new stock issuing. Initial Public Offerings let firms raise capital from public investors. Generally, the change from private company into a public company lets private investors reap gains from their investment, these often include shares and option contracts for private investors. While, public investors get to purchase a small piece of the company.

What’s the benefit of investing early?

Well, the benefit of investing in an IPO for a successful company is big gains – for example if you had invested in $5,000 into Microsoft (MSFT) when it went public, you’d be looking at millions of dollars’ worth of gains – around 10.4 million. While obviously these massive gains are attractive for long term investors, the reality reflects a type of bias called survivorship bias. In fact, there’s a large body of research looking at IPOs and how profitable they are for investors. They attempt to answer just how profitable are such trades.

Research paper one – Does it pay to invest in IPOs?

Paper one is entitled “ Does it pay to invest in IPOs? Evidence from the Warsaw Stock Exchange ” which looks at IPOs on the Polish market between 2003 and 2011. They attempt to calculate IPO performance while taking into account transaction costs, alternative costs, and taxes. They analyzed this period because it was generally a bullish time period with one notable sharp correction in equities during 2007 and another short correction in 2011. At the height of the market in 2007 and 2011, there were more than 13.5 and 6.3 times the number of IPOs compared to 2003, respectively (The data from warsaw hints to another conclusion from other papers, that IPOs tend to happen near  market highs ). The total data set collected was 314 companies which conducted an IPO from 2003 – 2011.

The statistics section of the paper analyzes the returns of the stock and looks at abnormal returns within said time period. On average anything with an average return of above zero means that the IPO outperformed the market for said time period. Generally, the evidence suggests that the best strategy is to buy the stock and then sell on the same day for the best returns. The longer one holds onto an IPO the worse the returns are. The remaining graphs generally support this finding as there are positively skewed with a positive kurtosis meaning most of the returns fall closer to the mean and are generally positive for the initial day return.  

Research paper two – The persistence of IPO Mispricing

Another paper that looks at IPOs and initial returns paired with long run performance is a paper called “The Persistence of IPO Mispricing and the Predictive Power of Flipping.” The paper looks at “hot” IPO markets and attempts to determine if underwriters have difficulty in valuing companies. The main results are, yes, underwriters do have difficulty valuing and often under value companies – primarily those IPOs which are harder to value due to high levels of uncertainty like in tech fields. This paper was of interest because they classified “Hot” IPOs as high variability and high returns and they also test a trading strategy for use with IPO stocks.

The paper looked at IPOs between 1988 and 1995. The dataset consisted of around 1,232 initial public offerings. A fairly sizable sample size during one a very studied time period – the time leading up to the internet bubble. In the paper, the authors breakdown the sample size into four distinct groups in order to test the strategy “Cold” IPOs which are defined with a first day opening of zero or negative returns (around 26% of IPOs). While, the remaining ones are classified as “Cool”, “hot” and “Extra-hot”. “Cool” which accounts for 35% of the data has returns of zero to less than 10% on the first day of IPO. While “hot” are returns of 10% or greater but less than 60% returns and account for 36% of the sample. And finally, “Extra-Hot” are returns above 60%.

The first notable finding here is that extra hot IPOs perform less well than cool and hot IPOs. They found that ‘cold’ IPOs fell on average 1.4% in the month following offering. Further, they found that the mean and median of one-month excess returns for cold and extra hot IPOs are negative. However, the return is positive for ‘cool’ and ‘hot’ IPOs and continues into the six month and one-year time frame – and these results were significant.

"We find that the mean and median one-month excess return for cold and extra-hot IPOs is negative while the same return is positive for cool, and hot categories. The relationship of cold and extra-hot to cool and hot IPOs continues at the six-month and one-year time frames as well. In parametric as well as non parametric statistical tests,the differences between the four groups are significant at conventional levels"

Another notable finding from this paper is the result that institutions often under price IPOs in order to profit for themselves by selling shares onto the market on the first day or over the course of the first few months:

“That  is, ‘flippers’ quickly sell issues which perform worst in the future (often with the benefit of underwriter price support which minimizes their exposure to losses), and they curtail flipping activity in the best performing issues.    The evidence suggests either (1) that institutional investors have superior information relative to the underwriter in the market for IPOs (since they collectively appear to know and execute a profitable trading strategy on the first day), or (2)  that  underwriters  intentionally and  strategically  under-  and  over-price IPO ‘merchandise’ without immediate measurable penalties.”

Summary:

Both papers suggest something interesting, that trading IPOs can be a sound strategy if one gets lucky enough with them. However, one looked at buying into IPOs on the first day and holding them for various periods of time and found that, on average IPOs lost during the course of the next year. However, the paper on IPO mispricing found that if investors wait a day and classify the IPO into categories that first day returns can help predict future returns. Perhaps a sound strategy is to buy into them on the first day and then watch the returns, if they are a “cold” or “extra hot” IPO, you sell out of them the following trading day. But if they are not within those return ranges, investors hold onto them."

https://www.informedfinancials.com/2021/01/10/initial-public-offerings-and-profitability-for-investors/

TLDR:basically the strategy is to buy in on the first day and then depending upon how the first day results go, you either continue to hold it, or you sell out of it for a profit. I haven't traded IPOs before and was wondering if this is a good strategy for if they should be avoided entirely? I've also heard IPOs as "It's probably overpriced." I suppose it also depends on the financials of the company too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ YLCO to become RNRG, Renewable Energy Producers ETF Found this in the latest supplement to the prospectus. https://www.globalxetfs.com/prospectus-regulatory/?id=40

Old methodology for comparison - https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/YLCO-IM.pdf

YLCO is currently Global X YieldCo & Renewable Energy Income ETF. Its index methodology requires at least 2% dividend yield, relaxing this if necessary to reach 30 constituents.

It will change to ticker RNRG, Global X Renewable Energy Producers ETF.

"These changes will take effect on or about February 1, 2021".

In the new index, the key requirement is:

>the company generates at least 50% of its revenues from renewable energy production

The old index appears to be rather wider: its areas included not just energy production but all of the following:

>i.    YieldCos
>
>ii.   Renewable energy utilities
>
>iii.  Producers of renewable energy components
>
>iv.  Producers of biofuels
>
>v.   Smart grid companies facilitating renewable energy use
>
>vi.  Companies that install/operate/finance renewable energy systems
>
>• Only companies that derive greater than 50% of their revenues from the above business activities, or that generate greater than 50% of their energy production from renewable energy sources, are eligible for inclusion


I hold YLCO and this seems like potentially a big shift. I couldn't find any list of constituents of the new index yet.

YieldCos themselves seem to have mostly gone the way of the dodo bird, and the dividend requirement was maybe a temporary transition to what the ETF is becoming now.

Thoughts/discussion?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Difference between institutional and investor funds Hey guys,

Bit of a noob UK investor so I hope you guys can help. I bought into the same index fund, however by mistake I bought into the institutional fund rather than the investor fund. Does anyone know the difference between these two? I can’t find any resources about the differences. 

I hope someone can help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Silver, way more than just a precious metal and an incredible investment opportunity Something different as opposed to my usual uranium post, but in my opinion the opportunity that is presented in silver is worthy of a post on its own and as I mentioned before in my broad commodities post, it is my second favorite investment asset in the current market.

So what makes silver so compelling, even after it already ran up a lot between the March lows  of roughly 12 dollars per ounce and the subsequent rise to above 28 dollars a few months later. Since that moment, silver corrected and has been trading mostly sideways, looking to be building a base for the next leg up. Today it is trading at around half what it was at the previous peak of 50 dollars and I believe we will reach that all time high again, or at the very least get close to it, perhaps even as soon as the end of Q2 2021. Having said that, I will not rule out a final dip before this run commences (more on that later) and this should in my opinion be viewed as an opportunity for those wanting to invest into the silver market.

So why would silver run up more than it already has? Because of two reasons. The first reason has to do with the fact that silver is looked upon as a precious metal, a monetary metal even, that people purchase as a hedge against inflation. In that regard, it serves the same goal as purchasing gold would. With a Biden presidency now on the horizon, it has been clear that their immediate objective is to provide new stimulus. Joe Biden has publicly stated that he thinks 600 dollars per person is not nearly enough and that is should be upped to around 2000 dollars. The massive amount of stimulus will help fuel the next run in commodities and the general stock market, but especially gold and silver, because it devalues the dollar even further (which has been on a downward trajectory).

Now, given what was stated above, why don’t I just buy gold instead? Isn’t it the better monetary metal and an ever better hedge against inflation? Some might argue that it is, but the hedge part is only part of the reason I have added silver miners to my portfolio. The other reason has to do with the two things everyone on this sub loves so much: Electrical vehicles and renewable energy. The thing these two investment assets have in common, is that they require silver and a decent amount of it as well. Unlike gold, 60% of all silver demand comes from industrial usage. The amount of silver used by the auto industry alone will reach an around 70 million ounces by 2030, up from 45 million ounces back in 2017. Silver is very important for the renewed focus on electric vehicles, as is further elaborated upon in [this document](http://www.lbma.org.uk/assets/Alchemist/Alchemist_90/Alch90OConnell.pdf) .

Now, as for renewable energy and specifically solar, [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-green-silver-just-might-be-the-new-black-gold-1694ac5562bf) put it best. We need silver for renewable energy and for solar energy it can be reduced should it get too expensive, but definitely not fully replaced because of its unique properties. We will need *a lot* of silver for things like the green new deal and the focus it puts on solar power generation and reliance on batteries.

There are also other drivers, like the fact most pieces of the technology which have become integral to the way we go about living our lives also hold silver in various amounts. As you can see, silver is a very important metal. Not just as a hedge against inflation, but mainly as an industrial metal. Demand is increasing, but supply can’t be scaled up as easily as most might think. The reason for this, is that there are actually relatively few pure silver mines as opposed to copper or gold mines. Silver is often a byproduct produced from other mines. This makes it a lot harder to scale up the silver supply to meet the demand side. What also doesn’t help is that silver, like any commodity, has been through a cyclical downturn that ended around 2017 and has been slowly building momentum since. Before that however, there has been severe underinvestment into the sector, which translates into heavily reduced exploration and development of silver projects. Sure, now that silver prices are higher, they are starting this process again, but this takes time. Only a handful of projects ever properly make it into production and this can take several years, meaning that the cyclical downturn between 2011 and 2017 still weighs heavily on the sector today. This bull market still has plenty of legs and I believe it could run with the broad commodities bull market for several more years.

Lastly, for those who value technical analysis as well, silver just bounced off of the 200 day moving average and has backtested the previous resistance level from the recent highs. If this support holds, it confirms that the lows are in and that the next leg up can begin. There is however a chance that there is one final plunge before that leg commences. In that timeframe the dollar could have a small bounce, coinciding with the drop in silver, but will continue its downtrend quickly after that. Both from a technical as well as a fundamental standpoint, silver looks to be much higher by the time Q3 of this year rolls around.

TLDR: In summary silver is both a hedge against the devaluation of the dollar and a play on increased industrial demand due to prevailing macro trends around the world in the form of electric vehicles, renewable energy and other technology (phones, computers, batteries etc.). With increasing demand and a supply side which can’t be scaled up easily, price of silver looks set to go much higher from this point onwards. For every dollar that is added to the silver price, silver companies will move significantly more than that as their margins and free cash flow increases. I predict 40-50 dollar silver by the time we go into Q3 2021 and a significant increase in the share price of the underlying equities, with the disclaimer that in the very near term (this month) it could take one final plunge downwards before moving up like it did between March and August of last year.

Disclaimer: I hold shares in PAAS and AG. For new investors that want exposure to this market, but don’t want the risk of owning an individual company, I would advise to look at the ETF SILJ, which holds silver juniors and looks to be the best positioned ETF to take advantage of this bull market. Make sure to always do your own research, I am merely here to present an investment case for a metal I believe to be undervalued relative to where it can go in the near future.

As bitcoin touched All time high of 40K and money starting to pour into high cap coins and mid cap coins. Anytime money can flow into low cap coins for fully blown altcoins bull run. Below are the list of top 5 potential 50x in alt coin bull and reasons why chose them.

1) Fusion - It has great tech likes Time lock, quantum swap, DCRM. Working product like Anyswap and new "be your own bank" app called chainge is under development. Compared with DOT, NEO, ATOM fusion is highly under valued. MC less than 12m and circulating supply of 66m and Max supply of 81M fusion is already 50X behind NEO, ATOM and DOT. No doubt it can pump up so easily. There is speculation of Binance listing soon.

2) Aergo - Aergo has a great tech with proven 13K TPS. They have solid parnership with samsung and korean government. Apart from that they have parnerships with PWC, Hyundai etc. Their main product Aergo Hub beta gonna be launched soon and mainnet of aergo by end Q1. It will explode like theta anytime

3) ANY - Anyswap is a by product of fusion and competitor to ethereums uniswap. Anyswap is cheap and tokens are listed after due diligence and community voting so no scam coins will be listed here easily. They have more interoperability and bridged many other chains. DCRM usage in anyswap makes it more secured compared to ethereums. Their Native token ANY and its MC is so undervalued their tech and when compared to UNIswaps UNI. Easy 50X token as total supply is any is only 100m and circulating supply is less than 13m.

4) Navcoin - Navcoin MC is less than 11m and they launched privacy protocol on January. It will be implemented on March first week. Compared to Verge, XMR, ZEN, PIVX, FIRO the current market cap of navcoin is so much under valued as supply of navcoin is just 70m with small inflation.

5) Credits - Only 220m supply, 1m TPS which team is trying to prove in mainnet. The price has gone much so down but once they prove their TPS it can do easy 50X. But it's highly speculative.

All the tokens which I picked up or less than 12m MC. There are few other good ones like QUANT, TRAC but they already seen some good runs so I have excluded it here.
