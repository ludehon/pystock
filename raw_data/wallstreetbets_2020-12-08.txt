LongTerm Play Hi,

As some of you may or may not know IBM is splitting into 2 companies next year. IBM has also experienced significant layoffs in the US and will do so in Europe. This is unfortunately not great news for the employees who were hit by the layoffs, but it is a good sign for investors.

IBM has become WAY too big (300,000 employees), and WAY to diverse. It will be splitting into a Consulting business and IBM will stay as a tech company. This means that next year IBM will be a lighter ship which will be easier to maneuver, innovate, and deliver. Im in it for a long haul. What are your thoughts?

What this means is that the shares are supposed to be owned by market open on 12/21... which means most shares should be purchased by close of market on 12/18. However, funds have +/- 3 days to make the purchase, so 12/23 (and maybe 24th) is also perfectly valid for them to buy on.  Then there is the fact that, in the face of a big runup, they may opt to just miss their tracking marker for a few days while hoping for a 'sale' on TSLA.

Historically most funds purchase in the 24-48 hours leading up to inclusion date, although TSLA is anything but business as usual.

If you are trying to time a buy (or sell), the drop may not be until 12/28 or later.  It's possible we even get a squeeze AFTER 12/28 as funds look around and realize the price is still rising.

The .8% of float being issued today into a 30% of float forced-buy did almost nothing to relieve buying pressure.

Shoutouts to whomever started the snapshot cheat sheet_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ZUO primed for LT growth **TL; DR:** ZUO is rapidly approaching profitability in a tough year, and the Stripe Partnership might give them the boost they need to really take off in 2021.

I hold short term calls and several shares of Zuo.

**General Thesis**
Zuora is a SaaS company providing billing, payment, collection, and data analysis tools for companies that use subscription payments for revenue.  The main drivers for its revenue are the number of users and the amount of usage.  Anyone that pays attention, knows that the number of subscription companies is going up and up.  It is a proven model that many companies enjoy.  Thus, Zuora is aiming to provide the software tools to help those companies best leverage the model.

**Numbers**
Even during the pandemic, where cost cutting pressures have inspired many to cut their subscriptions, Zuora was able to obtain 11% YoY growth in number of key customers and 31% increase in customer usage YoY.  Since 2017, the gross profit has steadily increased about 35% each year and looks to maintain that pace in 2020.

The stock price dropped from 2018 until more recently because of high net losses in 2019 (substantial increased operating expenses due to being a publicly-traded company) and the black swan event that was the pandemic.  Further, the revenue didn't increase as much in 2019 (17.5%) as it did in 2018 (49%), and this year it only appears to be increasing by 8%.

However, the operating expenses (R&D, marketing, etc.) are increasing at a slower rate than the gross profit in 2020, which is reflected in the decreasing net losses reported in the past 3 out of 4 quarters.  It is worth mentioning that they beat analyst expectations in all of those 4 reported quarters and the trend line is toward net profits.  They project a net loss of $14mn with a revenue over $300mn for 2020.  Even though the revenue increase is fairly disappointing, the decreasing net losses is pretty encouraging when obtained in a year like 2020.  With Zuora being on the verge of profitability, increases in customer numbers and therefore revenue could result in profit for the year 2021.  Cue Stripe.

**Stripe Partnership**
Many of Stripe's customers use the subscription model.  And Stripe has a lot of customers with famous brands that could be key customers of Zuora.  As reported on MarketWatch, the partnership will allow Zuora customers to use the payment processing and fraud detection technology of Stripe. In the announcement, the CEO of Zuora mentioned that companies with recurring-revenue models (subscriptions) have a lower chance of fraud, so they should be able to attract better payment-processing rates from Stripe.  To me, if Zuora is able to provide its customers better payment-processing rates via its partnership with Stripe, then this provides an incentive for relevant Stripe customers to also use Zuora.  From a customer perspective, the decrease in payment-processing rates paid to Stripe while using Zuora could subsidize the subscription cost of Zuora, and the tools of Zuora could help increase revenue for said customer.  The partnership could be a catalyst for Zuora customer growth/revenue and therefore push Zuora into profitability.

**Industry PE Ratio**
Zuora's current market cap is $1.4bn on a projected revenue of about $300mn for this year and $14mn in losses.  With PE ratios so high these days, especially with software companies, I think any indication of profitability from Zuora could send the stock price flying.

**Conclusion**
Thus, I am bullish long term with Zuora, and because the market is forward looking, I think people will try to jump in early.  This could cause the stock price to bounce fairly quickly in the short term, too.  Last I checked, the current days to cover for shorts is 4 days._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HRB down 13% this week due to low EPS on their earning reports. But... Okay, hear me out. H & R Block (HRB) stock is down like 13%. But who the heck is doing taxes is in December. Taxes aren't due until what, like April?  So logic dictates that when people go to do their taxes, they will pay H & R Block money, and when they get money, the stocks go up.

This can be a big move. Intel has 110,000 employees. The cost for Atlassian is user based licensing.

Looking at job reqs on Linkedin and Intel's corporate site, shows lots of their new positions for software engineers and technical management now require some kind of Jira experience and/or Atlassian api and configuration experience. No longer wanting Rally experience. Linkedin also shows Intel employees who's job responsibilities are include Jira management and engineers who develop Jira dashboards.

https://preview.redd.it/ha324pdfu0461.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d17fa836c86309ead8d3cd9693c7f6c5a587184_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CHWY - PT $108 - Dog Telemedicine 🥰 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I present to you December's meme stonk: AT&T _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To the Moon! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Implied Volatility logic So here's my doubt I had for ages: 

We know VIX is the volatility indicator and we know the more volatile the stock is the more premium we get. So if VIX gets super low, then would we get less premium for the same stock (or same beta stock)? So to earn high juicy premiums (theta gang stuff) we need high volatile markets with volatile stocks? Trying to put two and two together :/

The second part of my question is related to IV crush! So how does beta (standard deviation), relate to IV crush? I know the price should move in my favor by a wide margin for it to make a profit and that's what IV crush basically is. I think I am relatively advanced in fundamental and technical analysis so need some help here!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀🚀🚀Doubling Down on $BB 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It’s working _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’m just an idiot trying to keep my account above $25k for day trading. In musk we trust _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here] I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.

To start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you’re boarding a rocket). I'm holding them all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I’ll know pretty soon.

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?

Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.

This is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.

EDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.

I'm sure you have all heard of the gamma squeeze narrative. Google it if you haven't TL;DR, retail call buyers FORCE MMs to buy shares.

https://ibb.co/0BBpx85

This a chart plotting how many shares enter the market when STMP stock price goes up a dollar. Some napkin math reveals that 160,000 shares enter the market if price goes up 10%.

Here are some other fun facts.

Daily volume is ~200-500k. 

Dollars/delta on a slightly otm option for jan is ~23 bucks. Meaning that one would only need to buy ~7 million dollars worth of that option to own ~200k delta.

In other words, if ~7 mil in call options are purchased, MMs NEED to buy 200k shares. This is positively insane. 

Remember how stocks like PLTR and NIO moved after retail got to them? They had similar set ups before they went ballistic.

Here is some other DD on STMP, from a more fundamental angle: [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/k3qlbd/record_online_sales_implications_for_stampscom/)

e: [proof](https://ibb.co/168HByt)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There has been plenty of 10 baggers recently but how has QS been so under the radar?? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cloudflare is up 115% from when i invested _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bob Swans ugly duckling INTC Intel is the leader in the integrated design and manufacturing of microprocessors found in PCs and servers. With the rise in interconnectivity of devices, Intel strives to provide the most powerful and energy-efficient silicon solution to any product "smart and connected." The data centers used to facilitate the information stored, analyzed, and accessed by various front-end devices are mostly run with Intel server chips. While the firm has had issues with its 10-nanometer process in recent years, I expect the firm to get back on track with its 7-nanometer process in 2021 with the help of EUV lithography. As cloud computing continues to garner significant investment, Intel's data center group will be an indirect beneficiary. Mobile devices have become the preferred device to perform computing tasks and access data via cloud infrastructures that require considerable server build-outs. 


This development has provided strong tailwinds for Intel's lucrative server processor business. I believe the Altera and other AI-related acquisitions will help Intel maintain its recent growth trajectory in the space, as customers increasingly seek out customized server solutions. The proliferation of mobile devices has come at the expense of the mature PC market, Intel's historic stronghold, with ARM and its cohorts joining AMD as chief rivals. The rise of artificial intelligence has also unleashed a new competitor in Nvidia for specialized chips to accelerate AI-related workloads. Consequently, Intel has built a broad accelerator portfolio via the acquisition of Altera for FPGAs, Mobileye for computer vision chips used in cars, Nervana neural processors, and Movidius VPUs. Intel reported third-quarter results that could be characterized as a mixed bag, including continued strength in cloud spending and notebook PC demand, while enterprise and government data center sales fell significantly and margins contracted. 


Management had anticipated these trends, though the ultimate mix skewed more to margin-dilutive products such as 5G networking ASICs and notebook PC CPUs than I had expected. While COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation to boost cloud and notebook PC demand to support working and learning from home, other areas of Intel’s broad business have been negatively impacted (such as Internet of Things, Mobileye, and memory). Cloud spending is expected to slowdown after four consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth for Intel’s cloud-related data center group, or DCG, revenue. Shares were down nearly 10% during after-his trading and are back to similar levels to the end of July when Intel announced its 7-nanometer process would be delayed at least six months. CEO Bob Swan reiterated Intel’s 2023 products would be made on either Intel 7-nm fabs or external foundries or a mix of both. 


I like Intel’s recent deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for $9 billion, as it will allow the company to streamline its focus on its core competencies of CPU design and manufacturing while providing a solid cash infusion. Although the next few quarters are likely to be challenging for the firm as AMD continues to attack Intel’s PC and server CPU dominance, I believe Intel’s 10-nm Tiger Lake notebook CPUs and Ice Lake server CPUs should help it mitigate share loss. Third-quarter sales were down 4% year over year, as PC-centric sales rose 1% and data-centric sales fell 10%. Management expects fourth-quarter sales of $17.4 billion, which would be down 14% year over year. 


The cyclical industry in which Intel operates will cause its profitability to fluctuate regardless of how successful it is in tailoring its processors to new markets. my uncertainty rating is medium and reflects the underlying risk faced by Intel regarding the proliferation of mobile devices at the expense of PCs, the expanding role of server processors in its product mix, and the advancement of technology nodes to 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, and so on. Relative to other semiconductor firms, I do believe Intel’s scale and market position will allow it to better handle volatility than smaller peers, leading to my medium rating in lieu of high that is commonplace for other semiconductor firms. 


In the PC space, any misstep by Intel could lead to AMD capturing market share. Any prolonged delay in process technology by Intel would allow other semiconductor manufacturers to quell Intel’s lead and offer processors at the same node as Intel or even surpass it. Recent achievements by Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung seem to have turned this possibility into a reality, with the two foundries reaching the 7-nanometer node (in high volume capacity) in 2018, while Intel pushed out its 10-nanometer products to 2019. I note that not all processes are created equally, however, with nomenclatures serving as marketing terms over precise dimensions, but Intel's 10-nm delays are still concerning, particularly as AMD is making products on TSMC’s 7-nm process.

those of you who bought SNOW earlier are now seeing lots of green numbers on your phone screens, which is fun with this astronomical price but I hope you realise only 10% of total shares (24M out of 240M) are currently in circulation.

The rest is held by employees, like CEO Frank Slootman who has a share strike price of $8.88 (he only came in April 2019 so you can be sure there are plenty of people in the company with cheaper stock options) and exclusive investors who were offered to buy it before the IPO for a maximum of $120 a share. Now those remaining 90% of shares are currently in lock up period but the first 11M of those are gonna be "unlocked" on Monday, Dec 14 and you better bet there will be a fire sale at these returns. 15 days after that, if the price holds above $160 for 10 of 15 consecutive days, another 37M shares are unlocked, which means triple the circulation by January and all of those people bought it for pennies compared to retail investors.

I strongly recommend Steven Fiorillo's article on Seeking Alpha this morning, which goes in depth to analyse the fundamentals and valuation - that was when SNOW was 10% lower than now.

Snowflake is a fine company with potential but is worth nowhere near current insane levels, even if you drink their marketing kool aid. And if you're thinking if Warren Buffet bought it, it's good enough for me, then rest assured Berkshire most likely paid less than $120 for a share.

Greed is good as long as you're not too greedy. Cash out and take profits now before you'll get a rude awakening next week.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks.

As you can see in the chart below, we are replicating the movements made by Nio in the first phase of its run-up. We had the initial run up from about $5/share to $16 and then a fall and consolidation to about $10. It then subsequently moved up to about $15 giving the illusion of a double top and trapping all the bears when it then fell to $12 before rocketing up to $20.

https://preview.redd.it/f2q9pv3310461.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4617e401f9dbbfc32d1e925972834c40306f529

Again, chart looks the same as Tesla in the transition from the first run-up to the second run-up. You had a short term top at around 185, a drop to 68 (much higher fib retracement likely due to more short seller interests being accumulated at this point), recovery to around 170 and then a small drop to 150 before the next leg up.

https://preview.redd.it/eguhknb1k0461.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7b8c5f61d6197e949a76d7be1b039feaa307f8f

&#x200B;

In a similar way, expect consolidation for a couple of days and a near term bottom of around 23-26 before the next leg moves up. If we go by Nio, expect a target of $41-45 over the next 2-3 weeks. So get out of your 12/11 weekly calls now, those won't pay out and will likely just eat theta.

https://preview.redd.it/wemw3ofszz361.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3d6ba992b74ea6260ff956ba5c2dc300a5f8cf

Option convexity is also sort of at a mid point between the lows achieved on 12/2 and the extremes exhibited on 11/25, which tells you we are sort of nowhere near a short term bottom or a short term top.

https://preview.redd.it/xlpdfz1hzz361.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d7e5841e6d5517b4c93d3e2d5182a26e392b12

I did not bother playing this expected short term volatility as I bought 1/15 calls at the $22 low. But you'll probably get another chance at it if we see PLTR at the 24-26 range.

**TLDR: roll out your 12/11 options, bet on 12/25 options at the earliest, best strikes are 25-35. Cashout at least 2/3 if PLTR hits $41-44.Don't be surprised if we have a couple more down 10% days this week to burn out the 12/11s.**

This means, to be counted as a postive in the results, you must be symptomatic AND have a positive test

>Among 3410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group.

Here, we can see that they didn't test 3000 suspected cases. They would not be suspected cases if they were tested, by definition. Clearly this is a big deal as the placebo group shows many more infections

Here we can see the lack of testing. Of 40,000 participants, assuming all were a placebo, would yield ~200 infections.

We control the media now boys. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNOX is about to change the fucking world  Now, what is Nano-x Imaging, and why should you degenerates know about this company? Some people refer to them as the TSLA of the medical imaging world, Ill try to summarize wtf NNOX does as quickly as possible in the next "few" points.

&#x200B;

1.**NNOX (** [Nanox.vision](https://www.nanox.vision/) **)** is a medical imaging startup that has developed a X-Ray source magnitudes of orders cheaper than current technology. Its basically the same improvement as going from an incandescent bulb to a modern led.

Why is this important? X-Rays, Ct scans, and other radiological imaging is currently expensive as shit resulting in 2/3rds of the world being unable to access the technology. NNOX hopes to make their "biobeds" so cheap that they'll basically give them away for free \~ 14k vs the millions that the machines cost nowadays therefore allowing them to implement a better pricing model.

&#x200B;

2. They will be implementing a pay per scan model allowing poorer areas without access to top radiologists to submit scans and have them processed by NNOX's radiologists and machine learning network.

This is the future more than the proprietary and patented X-ray source that will make this model possible. Cheap scans for the whole world will result in boatloads of data on every single disease and injury detectable by x-ray imaging, and that can be used to train their AI to not only make scans even cheaper but to have them process magnitudes faster and more accurately than human doctors.

&#x200B;

3. They have a lot of partnerships with major payers, and have board members that are already loaded. (SK Telecom, Foxconn, SK Hynix) They have 0 reasons to risk their money and reputations on something that wont make a dent in their net worth until NNOX demonstrates and establishes their technology globally.

&#x200B;

4. Finally and probably the most important point is that Citron tried to shit on them calling them a fraud.

He Ended Up Losing $127,000. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RPRX Lock-up Dump Hi retards, im pretty sure RPRX insiders are pumping the stock to dump it better next week where millions of share will be unlocked for trading (IPO agreement). 

End of the lock-up date: 14 December 

Numbers: Now avaiable on the market: around 83M | Total shares outstanding 370M!!!!!

so the difference is 287M that is 3 and half times the shares now on the market

The stock is increasing little every day (today big +5%) but with a ridicolous low volume so i think they are driving the price higher too fool retail investors so they can dump the hell of 200+M shares at a super price! 

Why they're gonna sell? well the IPO price was 28$ so they're gonna secure some profits no?!

Do your play retards! i dont remember but 2 weeks ago someone suggested a play like this one on another stock and it went very well (the stock dumped alot as expected)

Hey everyone ! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0).

We saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.

So, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company. I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a correction instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \[buy the news/sell the event\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w)

Some of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.

While the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement is [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors bought more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.

Also, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.

So, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than ¾ expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.

Most investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.

While this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don’t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)

I think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don’t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, and with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily as we also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the “vaccine summit” will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.

On some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France, following the Netherlands and Germany launches.

While the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.

After the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle and to crush them, as pets have become more and more popular this year.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of "offers" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.

**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and "buy now, pay later" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**

**EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year**

For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.

Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as "Engaging the next generation" and the ability to "unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk".

Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at.

This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks

At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.

**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Watching PLTR open _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AH Price Actions _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SPCE SPCE - Virgin Galactic is set to launch in the next few days.

How are you playing earnings? The OI on this option chain is literally fucking insane btw. Within 2 dollars of current price there are 15k put options expiring this week and 9k call options, which notionally control 2.4 million shares so like 3 or 4% of float or whatever

Next week has an even more absurd amount of put options OI - fucking 30k of put options within 2 dollars of current share price, only 10k of call options so 4 million shares notional

That's straight up 10% of float that is in options within 2 dollars of share price expiring within the next 10 days, this shit is gonna be volatile af and I wish I knew how to figure out how to play tomorrow but alas I'm too dumb, as IV gets crushed though all these strike points are going to become pretty strong gamma inflection points is my guess. 

Another interesting point is that the borrow rate has increased from 11% or whatever a week ago to 28% yesterday and today. 

Catalysts for today's call

* Management still hasn't really given Microsoft revenue details
* Addressing Cohen's concerns
* GME stopped buybacks until 2021 but given the new administration which may try to limit buybacks is there a chance that management yeets their roll into share buy backs before Buyden and co. run things?

DD below which I encourage you to read before making your own decision.

**Introduction**

The used auto market in the US is huge, fragmented, and has significant room for online sales penetration. CarMax has only 2% market share and the top 100 dealers account for less than 10%. As a result, there is ample room for multiple winners, especially as people start to move into online sales which is only \~1% of the existing used car sales! (Stat as of 2019).

COVID is a huge catalyst for upping the online used car sales penetration – it accelerated the adoption of buying cars online, a trend that was already beginning with millennials. This is an opportune time to steal share as very few dealers can actually facilitate a credible e-commerce experience for used vehicles at the moment.

We thus have a macro backdrop that fires on all fronts: Used vehicle sales have continued to increase (by volume and by ASP), the market is highly fragmented, there is an exogenous catalyst that is shifting the industry towards a greater share of online sales, and there is a first-mover with a depressed valuation.

&#x200B;

**Growth Drivers**

1. **Offline-to-online**. The shift from offline to online for vehicle sales appears to have hit a position point of inflection. This was happening before Covid due to desire for transparency, broader unit selection, and general convenience. While autos are still only \~1% online, Covid has been a catalyst that has normalized online vehicle sales, and it’s one of those things that is here to stay. (Like video conferences.) Vroom will be able to help drive the shift to online by leveraging their national scale. This allows them to aggregate demand and create a central marketplace in what is a highly fragmented market. Mom and pop dealerships will lose share as a result – they won’t be able to keep up with the broad selection at the Vroom’s and Carvana’s of the world.
2. **Marketing**. Vroom has demonstrated its ability to create meaningful value through their marketing efforts. In winter of 2019, their campaign increased revenue share from its website increased from 26% to 43%. These direct sales are higher ROI than using performance marketing (where folks often have a take rate on directed traffic), and are a real value-add in a business model where advertising performance is a differentiator among competition due to the fragmentation of the industry.
3. **Ability to add and cross-sell products**. Moving into financing and assurance products like VSCs, GAP insurance, and tire & wheel packages provide another meaningful avenue of growth for Vroom. Carvana has seen success here, and it is a natural next move as Vroom continues to grow and diversify its revenue streams
4. **Mix shift on Vehicle Reconditioning Centers.** Vroom has begun building shifting its vehicle reconditioning centers to third party services. As volumes increase, they are able to achieve more attractive take rates, providing an additional stream of revenue. Vroom currently uses partners for 40-60% of reconditioning. Lowering the overhead footprint that comes with fully-owned VRC’s presents furth room for margin expansion.
5. **Increasing consumer-sourced vehicles.** As Vroom has begun to build out its name, they expect to shift more towards sourcing vehicles straight from consumers. This is a higher margin opportunity than sourcing vehicles from dealers/auctions, and will provide not only volume growth for the top line, but improve the margin profile going forward.
6. **Vroom is outperforming competition on driving traffic to its website compared to CarMax, and is efficiently competing on app downloads**

**Recent Performance and Outlook**

Reflecting its very early stage of growth, Vroom’s e-commerce units sold grew at more than 80% last year and are poised to do so again in 2020 despite a slowdown in growth after the pandemic struck in March (units more than doubled year-over-year in each of the three quarters ended March 2020). While the company currently working through some friction on sales support given the volume has increased so much, brokers expect growth in e-commerce units sold to re-attain its pre-pandemic pace of more than doubling year-over-year by the second quarter of 2021, translating into an acceleration in e-commerce units sold to roughly 120% next year. (Source: William Blair)

* Q3 gross profit of $25mn (+62% y/y) vs. estimates of $22.3mn (12% beat). The beat waws driven by ecommerce units reaching 8.8k (+59% vs. +74% in Q2)
* Total gross profit per unit (GPU) increased 154% q/q to $2,474, driven primarily by improvements in reconditioning and inbound logistics costs.
* Adj. EBITDA of ($35.7)mn was better than consensus at ($42.1)mn. This was because in Q3, SG&A decreased by \~4%
* Management affirmed guidance above consensus estimates for the full year. As a result, Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month price target to $60 from it’s prior level at $52. J.P. Morgan set its price target to $70. In fact, of the 30+ equity research analysts covering the stock, \~75% rate it as a buy, and \~25% rate it as a whole <1% consider it a sell.

**Downside Risks**

* Vroom could have below-average execution on scaling third-party reconditioning centers and logistics which would make margin improvement happen more slowly
* Vehicle demand could fall if we hit a major recession. (Although in 2008 it bounced back very quickly)
* If fully autonomous ride-sharing becomes a major thing and no one buys cars anymore, then Vroom would suffer_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I guess Elon took Michael Burry’s advice...true autist at work.... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BFT to the moon _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taking the cue from Cohen So as it seems that us retards are being seen by the outside world as somehow starting to have some credibility (see Jim Cramer's shoutout) and that we seem to have a fairly significant chunk of the outstanding shares. I think we should use this to our advantage as GME shareholders to walk the board through what should be done to come out on the other end of this by making a more detailed next steps letter than Cohen did.

I believe we all are uniquely positioned to give a fairly accurate VOC (ELI5: Voice of the customer, basically a company surveying customers to see what they want so that they can sell shit to them) since we are all playing video games on some device while our wife goes on dates with her boyfriend.

I wanted us to lay these ideas out that we believe will help the company and then we can get one of the less retarded of us to send the best ideas in a letter to the board.

To start off, one idea I have to leverage the current brick-and-mortar locations is to create a return partnership with these e-retailers like Amazon has with Kohl's but specifically for gaming returns. Kohl's uses it to increase foot traffic by giving the person returning something a receipt with a Kohl's coupon which greatly increases the likelihood of making a sale.

 i.  Profit Margin 

The figure above shows that NVidia’s revenue generating in terms of cost have slightly improved with a value of 0.620, compared to 0.612 in 2019. 

 ii.  Operating Margin 

The chart above shows NVidia’s ability to generate cash from its operating activities have slightly decreased, however, it is anticipated that the operating revenue will significantly improve in the Q4 2020.

**2.**  **Management Effectiveness**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bolyn3ra2z361.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e9cfd5be1a116b660faa7ceeb9fec52e576af0

 i.  ROA 

The Return on Assets on NVidia for 2020 was 0.61, dropped from 0.31 in 2019 showing the company’s lack of efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales. 

 ii.  ROE

Similarly, the Return on Equity also decreased from 0.44 in 2019 to 0.23 in 2020. 

**3.**  **Liquidity Ratios**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjg1kndc2z361.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=033c09b6ee349b7f1cad200a5aef7d9dc93c5af6

Liquidity ratios show a company’s both short term and long term cash requirements. Current ratio is slightly lower in 2020 compared to 2019. The 2020 is standing at a current ratio of 7.67 while the 2019 stood at 7.94. 

However, Quick Ratio for 2020 is significantly higher compared to 2019; with 2020 standing at a value of 7.13 while 2019 was 6.76. Quick ratio has improved, so overall we can draw a positive result. 

**4.**  **Stock Price History**

**Recommendation:**

A 12 month forecast of NVIDIA shows that the stock is estimated to top 700; a median of 600. **Aka CALLS CALLS CALLS.**  The median estimate showed a +10.2% increase from the last price of the stock at $544. Current analysis of NVIDIA shows a strong buy rating and the rating has been steady since November 2020. The company’s PE ratio is below the average with a value of 88.98 which makes the stock undervalued; making the stock look even more attractive to “Buy.” Moreover, the company’s cash flow has also improved as well as the liquidity position has improved. However, there are no massive threats that could potentially harm the company’s profit margins in coming years and consensus regarding the performance are positive and a “healthy” margin is expected in near future. I would give a “Super Fucking Buy” recommendation of NVIDIA for the Q4 of 2020 and looks like the forecasts earnings will be outrun by the company’s performance

Guy FOMOs into TSLA, 12 hrs later the news hit. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There it is boys, PFE to the moon _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you were watching PLTR at market close 12/7/20 this is for you. $29 EOD _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who else thinks there will be massive profit taking in Jan 2021? Given TSLA (and many other high valuation stocks) are up massively in 2020... I think January 2020 might be a market wide sell off or rotation out of all the stocks that rallied in 2020 with super high valuations (for tax purposes... people are just waiting to take profits in 2021 so they can wait an extra year to pay their capital gains).

I'm thinking about put options on a lot of the companies in the EV Space (NIO / TSLA / etc) that are up 1000-2000% in 2020.

My thoughts are as follows for TSLA:

\-the index fund managers have been consistently buying TSLA since Nov 16 since they will be required to include it in their index... these funds have trillions under management...the s&p is weighted by market cap... so these guys have to buy billions of TSLA... hence how the stock has gone from 400 to 650.

\-idk if the stock will pop or drop on the 21st... if there are index fund managers who procrastinate... then it might pop on the 21st due to the last minute buying.

\-what I feel fairly confident in (based on human psychology) is that there is going to be massive profit taking in January... any rational person holding onto the stock that wants to trim their position or sell it entirely is just going to wait a couple weeks such that they sell it in 2021 and wait an extra year to pay taxes.

I just bought a TSLA put option at a strike price of 630 that expires mid February.

If TSLA Stock continues to go up more, I'll buy another on Dec 21 in the morning and afternoon._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TROX is primed to 🚀🚀🚀 ***TL;DR*** - TROX's projected estimated growth per share is .0457. Something catastrophic has to happen to keep this stock from skyrocketing.

***Intro***

Hi all, ya'll might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/). I made my money researching value stocks and buying a combination of calls and shares to minimize risk and maximize rewards. 

TROX has been one of my money makers. On 11/9, [I bought 2 $12 2/19 calls at $1.7.](https://puu.sh/GVq9K/44e6cdd8db.png) On 11/24, [I bought 3 more $12 2/19 calls at 1.85.](https://puu.sh/GVqbw/95e814e872.png). On 12/7, [I sold 1 call at 2.97](https://puu.sh/GVqdI/46c2031941.png), [3 $12 2/19 calls at 3.00](https://puu.sh/GVq92/3944c6aa44.png), and [1 call at 3.20](https://puu.sh/GVqea/dc08f11ac6.png). In one month, I made a 69.5% profit strictly on these calls.

***Company Data***

Tronox Holding PLC produces titanium products. [Titanium prices crashed around 2016 to $4,100 from a high of $16,700 in 2006.](https://puu.sh/GVqkX/c6c28bdd21.png) **Ever since then, the price of Titanium has been steadily going back up (!!!).**

**Price per Earning - 2.29x compared to an industry average of 104.47 (!!!)**

Price per Book - 1.35x compared to an industry average of 5.27

**Price per Earning Growth - .0457x (!!!!!) compared to an industry average of 1.01**

**Dividend Yield - 1.92% compared to 1.86 industry average. Most companies in the industry don't pay a dividend (!!!)**

***Personal Thoughts***

The value of this stock is insane. It has already recovered from the Corona crash and is up 20.73% to $14.62 from it's pre-Corona high of $12.11 this year and shows no signs of slowing down. It's earning growth is through the roof and I believe it will continue to do so as both the economy recovers and the price of Titanium recovers. I was originally happy with my initial profit, but after doing more research, I'm more than happy to jump back in for the long term and ride this ship to the moon.

As with all of my posts, please feel free to ask questions, critique, and analyze my comments. Regardless of how it goes, I will post an update on my position so we can analyze what went right/wrong._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stripe Lite - BFT stock All, for those interested in getting in on a small fintech play, BFT Spac is taking paysafe public, This company will have a 9b dollar market cap and has tons of runway for growth.

[Press F for whomever bought calls at market close.](https://preview.redd.it/m4d768rigy361.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1034f8a552a54bc8185ea3cdcedfff5795f68e7)

First off to those who rode the TSLA bull yesterday and took profits along the way, congrats you got lucky. This post is for the majority of you dumbasses who FOMO'ed and bought calls at the top and panic sold at the pullbacks, or those who bought calls at market close.

FOMO is one of the strongest human emotions and is the reason why 99% of retail traders get chewed up by the institutions. When you see a meme stonk pumping like TSLA you will have the urge to buy calls AFTER it has already gone up. Admit it. This urge is stronger than:

* The urge to eat when you're fasting.
* A heroin addict's will to do anything to get that next hit.
* The urge to masturbate when your wife withholds sex with you, but she's banging her boyfriend Chad instead.
* A Karen's urge to launch a complaint and ask to speak to the store manager.

What you're supposed to do is have a binary requirement after a stock goes up and is everextended:

* Wait for a pullback to a previously established support level to go long.

\-or-

* No trade

Most traders CANNOT follow this easy set of binary rules. Instead, retail traders are doing the opposite and going long heavy or all-in after overextension. The possible results?

&#x200B;

1. Stock continues and goes up a little bit. You panic sell and take a measily 2.5% profit.
2. Stock has a sharp pullback and your OTM calls position goes -40%. You panic sell.
3. Stock has a sharp pullback and you diamond hand it until -90% or breakeven after the theta eats away the premium.

Picture whoever took the other side of your trade. What a great deal for them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Big D DD **The Great Bubble of 2020**  
&nbsp;


We all know that the market is in a major bubble and we also all know that all bubbles pop eventually. The problem is that eventually can be a very long time. The [M2 money stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) has been posted multiple times already but rarely are the [M1 stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) and the [MZM stock.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) MZM is the Money Zero Money stock and indicates the value of the M2 supply minus small denomination time deposits plus institutions. It gives us a better picture of what the big players are doing with their cash reserves that the M2 doesn't show. Combining all three [graphs](https://i.redd.it/lks874atux361.png) together show us the total inflation of money supply over time.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Why Do These Matter?**  
&nbsp;


We can look at the major indices and see that they follow each other pretty accurately over time [raw](https://i.redd.it/zik8tmjbyx361.png) but to see it more cleanly, here's the same info against a [log scale.](https://i.redd.it/djsjckhwnx361.png) Now we can see that according to all of these charts that not only do stocks always go up, but we also have plenty of room for them to go up further. This is further supported by viewing [SPX/MZM](https://i.redd.it/578tch32ux361.png) and [SPX/M2.](https://i.redd.it/2ogvc8xcsx361.png) Now I can already hear you saying "but Prop, these graphs are the same thing. Why post the same thing twice?" The answer is that because the MZM shows institutional money supply and M2 doesn't, we might expect that these graphs shouldn't be the same. We can also look at the [SPX/M1.](https://i.redd.it/br1bw2e4xx361.png) Since we have a sharp drop off at the end there we can interpret that as people moving liquidity into savings or other assets.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**How Housing Plays In**  
&nbsp;

 
If you've been living under a rock you probably don't know that on Dec 31st the [forebearacne provision of the CARES act ends.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/mortgage-relief/) What does that mean for us? Looking at the [mortgage delinquency rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS) we can see that come Jan 1st, we're going to potentially have a slew of bankruptcies as homeowners get foreclosed upon. For those of you who've seen The Big Short, you'll know that mortgage backed securities are still widely used and how it doesn't take high percentages of defaults to detonate them. The problem the first time was giving mortgages to people who wouldn't qualify for a payday loan. This time, the ineffective measures taken by the gov mean many otherwise credit worthy individiuals are now sub-prime, through no fault of their own.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Why This Falls Apart**  
&nbsp;


Now that we've got some background info. We can look at the [buffett indicator](https://i.redd.it/8g9mhit24y361.png) to see that the equity markets are insanely overvalued. Here's where hard data stops and my conjecture starts. We currently have a market heated to dot-com levels. That by itself doesn't mean anything. We didn't have the fed actively screwing with the bond market then. JPOW and presumably Janet Yellen remain committed to infinite QE to protect busisness from the slightest risk of bankruptcy. What they can't do is give money directly to people. This creates the situation where we have a K-shaped recovery actively happening. It works great, as long as average people can service their debt. The problem comes in on Jan 1st when the insulation of the CARES act ends and Congress currently doesn't seem interested in getting another round of stimulus going. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**What Does That Mean For The Market?**  
&nbsp;


If Congress doesn't see fit to bestow upon the plebs some Trump/Biden bux we can see that we'll likely see widespread housing defaults/foreclosures. Most people don't like to be homeless, especially in winter, so anyone who's in that situation who also has stock holdings would be highly motivated to sell to afford to pay their now urgent mortgage. The MBSs securitizing these mortgages will crumble if enough households fail to raise the cash to pay off their loan as a result. This can be entirely averted if stimmy happens and even if it doesn't, it's unlikely that all of this will happen before late Feb-March. It won't be a fast process by any means and Congress could end it at any time by getting their act together and passing something.

Here is more discussion on NVIDIA's blog:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676.pdf)

Although still in its early stages, this is an amazing step forward in using AI in critical areas like healthcare. I have been an investor in NVIDIA since 2016 and its been one heck of a ride (just like TSLA, PLTR, AMZN, AAPL, DKNG, U). While TSLA is by far my largest position, I have been steadily increasing my NVDA position as well - for years. I think it's time we gave a serious look to this Rocket Ship 🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (CME) Who’s ready to yolo on water? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NKLA investors right now _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Board the rocket that is *VXRT* So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.

**What is VXRT?**

Vaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. 

&#x200B;

**YTD History**

VXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. 

&#x200B;

**My Research and Thoughts**

VXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. 

The company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. 

There are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, 

 ***“Cost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someone’s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done. We have to have a much better way than what we have seen to get this distributed.”***

**TLDR**

There is risk. But this risk will pay off. A pill form vaccine is going to take us to the moon. Once funding is secured my bets are on a moon past 30 by first quarter.

[https://imgur.com/a/lEaOvOR](https://imgur.com/a/lEaOvOR)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why you should Short DOORTRASH I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).

**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**

Go read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.

Regarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.

1)You punch in an order for tendies.

2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying "Order? Ya takin this brah?" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)

3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.

4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.

5) A driver accepts

6) The restaurant hits a "confirmed rdy" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.

At EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the "Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.

Customers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit "Picked Up", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.

What happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.

Uber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers "boosts" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a "2$ boost" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).

**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**

Repeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.

Here's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.

The way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!

I get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.

I call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.

Here are the possible outcomes :

A) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.

B) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.

What do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an "independent contractor", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.

Let's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.

I've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.

Their support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.

I try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.

I leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.

I go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.

I go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support "Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time". Support says "That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming".

Next week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?

I could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.

My friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.

**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide "oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?"**

For those of you unfamiliar with the company, wish.com is the third largest e-commerce website in the United States and it has the most-downloaded shopping app in the world. 

Since 2018, the company’s revenue has more than doubled as it has perfected its targeted ad systems that tailors each social media ad to the customer it’s targeting. This is the reason for the ultra-specific ads you may be familiar with which cater to your profession, hobbies, interest, etc.

As of now the market is flooded with e-commerce sites like Amazon, which has the logistics market cornered, and Alibaba, which thrives on economies of scale. Wish.com brings its own unique benefit to the market, and that is in its proprietary ad-targeting algorithm, which operates similarly to the blockbuster app TikTok in providing content which targets the specific needs of the buyer.

I believe this factor alone sets Wish ahead of most of the e-commerce marketplace and could place them in the top three holders of global market share by 2025. 
In an inescapable age of information, information will continue to be the most valuable tool in securing buyers, and Wish has everyone beat in that department as of now.

I see this as an opportunity to get in on an Amazon or 
Alibaba initial offering. 

Before I go any further, I believe I should highlight that this is *NOT* a meme stock and it’s not more empty promises as we’ve seen in recent mergers and IPO’s. I think this is best evidenced by the players involved in this offering. The management of this company are not from retail backgrounds and this is not a retail company. At least not exactly. CEO Peter Szulczewski is an engineer from Google who **wrote the algorithm** for keyword search expansion. After leaving Google, he wrote an algorithm that analyzes browsing behavior to determine buying interests. When he realized how effective this algorithm was at suggestive selling, he put together a team including Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. All this is to say that Wish is not just a retail company.

**Wish.com’s main product is not goods— it’s buyers**

I see the most difficult hurdle for Wish to cross as supply chain logistics. Since independent sellers can list items on the marketplace, questionable practices often take place with regard to quality of goods and shipment. Wish has made advancements with regard to shipping including and agreement between China Post and the USPS, but they are way behind Amazon in their shipping infrastructure. This is in part due to their reputation as a low-cost marketplace preventing them from investing in high-cost shipping. This issue will need to be resolved for them to become competitive on a global scale.

Lastly, Wish has established itself not only as a major player in the global market but as a stock that is here to stay. Reinvestments into infrastructure, alongside groundbreaking advancements in the science of targeting advertisements puts Wish on the forefront of global commerce. The foundation is there, but the company has tremendous shoes to grow into.  

Here’s my prediction for the stock:

I believe the initial public offering will be the largest of this year, AirBNB included. I think as the funds become available, and if their worldwide shipping and customer service infrastructure are improved sufficiently, Wish could see a swift rise to become a household with few peers in market capitalization. Potentially one of the next trillion-dollar market cap stocks. I will be investing heavily at IPO.

P-price
E-employees
N-numbers
I-investments (are others investing/what are they investing in?)
S-space

**P**
Price-Before you invest, consider the price. Take a look at the price history of a stock, and see how its changed. A stock that has a fast price change may be more risky, but may also get you rewards faster. A stock that has slow price changes may not make you as much money as fast, but may also have less potential for you to lose money. Take a look at where the price is now to where it was 1, 3, 6, and 12 months ago. Look for a trend in the price history and find any news from around those times that might explain why it changed, and what it might mean for the future. 


**E**
Employees-ALWAYS find the number of employees in a company. This is often overlooked, and can determine if the company is going somewhere anytime soon. Especially for IPOs, SPACs, and smaller companies. 

Do you wanna be the idiot that bought shares from Jordan Belfort for a company with two people that make satellite dishes in their garage? I don’t think so. 

If there a very few employees, the company may not have enough people to get anything big going, and won’t be profitable anytime soon. 


**N** 
Numbers-Take a look at their financials. Look at their debt, income, profits, spending,etc. Companies that have high debt or low to negative profits may still have money to be made from, but it might not be anytime soon. Debt, income, profits, and company spending can heavily impact the price of a stock. Make sure to check when their earnings releases are as well. Even speculation about earnings, in the days and even week(s) leading up to a report can pump up or deflate the price of a stock. Rapid changes in value before an earnings report may be a sign that a sudden spike or dip in price is coming soon, so look out. 


**I**
Investments-Check what other people, corporations, and investment firms are saying and doing about it. If a large corporation is investing large amounts of money into the stock you’re looking into, they see the company is profitable. People may post online about what they’re investing in. Be wary of this advice. Make sure to do your own research, regardless of their reasons. They may be trying to organize a pump and dump scheme, but not always. If a big company or investment firm is selling large amounts of stock, they may see a better investment coming or expecting a big dip in share price soon. Be wary of these companies too. Citron is a perfect example that some people at the top are just as stupid as the average person. 


**S**
Space-See if the industry and company has space to grow. A company may have no debt, positive income, and a strong backround, but if it can’t improve much more, the company will probably see a decline or slow growth of value in the future. For example, the auto industry, which has been slowly dying (according to my dad, who has worked in it for ~30 year), has gotten a boost recently because of EV. Using green energy and trying to make it more efficient has 
opened up some space for the industry to grow. 

Bonus for S-Sober. DO NOT make any calls while on any kind of depressant. If you don’t wanna be sober while trading, stick to stimulants. There have been a handful of times where I have bought shares in a company while drunk or high, then not remembering until I open my portfolio the next day and finding out I bought some random ass stock while high off my ass. 

After using my P.E.N.I.S., I think you will be able to make better investments. It helped for me at least._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR still strong   

PLTR DD

Starting point**:** 

**RECENT EVENT REACTION**: Palantir's traction with large government contracts, such as its recent $44 million order with U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 treatment approvals, could be a sign the company is finding success with expanding uses of its products beyond defense, terrorism threats, cybersecurity and fraud detection. Still, customer concentration and lack of a cloud-based subscription model could limit Palantir's revenue-growth visibility beyond 2021. (12/08/20)

1. Palantir: Company Outlook THESIS: Palantir's software use for contact tracing and supply-chain analysis during the pandemic could be a tailwind for top-line growth and new-customer additions in the near-term. While the company's addressable-market view remains clouded by its lack of a partner ecosystem and reliance on large government customers for sales, we believe Palantir's proprietary datasets and shortening deployment times could help broaden its potential uses and diversify the customer base. Investments in building direct services 

**Valuation Unlikely** to Match Cloud IPOs Palantir is unlikely to garner a valuation similar to pure-play cloud-software IPOs, which averaged a 65% gain in their public-market debuts. While the company has strong intellectual property, built around the use of big data for its analytics offering, we believe its top-line growth in the $26.5 billion analytics tools software market could be limited by growing competition from stand-alone providers such as Tableau (bought by Salesforce.com) and Qlik, as well as hyperscale-cloud peers including Microsoft's Power BI and Amazon AWS. Palantir's lack of a partner ecosystem limits its operating-margin expansion, in our view. The company's multi-class voting structure, with a majority of voting rights for its co-founders, and a lack of customer diversification could hurt institutional interest. (09/29/20)

However in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. 

Fundamental

We can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.

&#x200B;

a) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because it’s a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding 

**What does the company do?** 

Data analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir's partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.

**The ownership** 

of institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. 

b) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. 

c) This shows us the ownership of the company.

**Insider Purchase sales** 

We can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didn’t effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down.

**Sells of PLTR** 

The majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didn’t sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) 

[figure 5 ](https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif)

 

**Earings report** predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. 

Operating profit to stock price.

In the supply chain of PLTR 

We can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. 

In short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company,

I was just looking into cheaper EV stocks and came across $FSR. I really like the Fisker Ocean and I think it could be nice competition for Tesla’s Model X in terms of aesthetics and price. 
Model X price - $80,000
Ocean price - $37,500

Model X range approx- 350 miles 
Ocean range 250 - 300 miles
 
Model X 0 -> 60mph - 2.6 seconds 
Ocean 0 -> 60mph - 2.9 seconds

Currently there are more than 10,000 reservations for the Ocean, so there’s a pretty nice demand for it. What’s your take on it?

 Here's your favorite astrologer with another beauty trade setup.

DOC forming a falling wedge and consolidating right into the zone and the momentum is turning around. It could bounce/consolidate around 2.38 and head back down to the 2 support level and make another run. Thit would be an optional place to scale in additional funds with a SL at 1.90 the risk/reward is quite attractive.  
The reasons why I think it won't bounce off 2.38 is because of the tailwind it has from the stay at home stocks. As the numbers climb they're coming back into favour and this is the canadian version. Expect it to break through 2.38 on the first attempt and the falling wedge and fib retracement levels (2.38, 2.59, 2.75, 2.91, 3.13, 3.41) will become support if it pulls back at all.  
Any retracement back to any of those levels confirms the pattern on the first bounce off and that can serve as a place to scale in a final time.  
Of course it could rip pretty quick at the same time with no real bounces to load up but one of the above scenarios is very likely. I'm 75% confident on this one, but that confidence would increase to 85% if it bounces off $2 one more time to fill up the wedge. Buying back in at $2 and keeping the SL at 1.90 minimizes losses and allows to be fully loaded for a final run at the wedge resistance.   


Another thing I like is the 13/30 MA (hourly)crossed over to the upside so we'll definitely head up in the short term.

Is this a good stock to hold long term? Who the hell knows? Is it a good stock to grab while virus numbers skyrocket? Very possibly.

You’re welcome. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Implied Volatility for Autists I'm sharing excerpts from two books on options - "Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings" & "Options Volatility & Pricing".  I actually read these books but found the sections on volatility most useful.  The goal is to inform about why you should stop providing liquidity for those who got in early and start understanding what the price of an option is communicating to you.  Buy low sell high in options means implied volatility.  What is 99 on a scale of 1-100?  

**Volatility**

What is volatility and why is it so important to an option trader?  In a sense, volatility is a measure of the speed of the market.  


Types of volatility:
future volatility, historical volatility, forecast volatility, implied volatility, seasonal volatility (commodities).


To help the new trader understand the various types of volatility, consider the following analogy to weather forecasting.  Suppose a trader living in Chicago gets up on a July morning and must decide what clothes to wear that day.  Do you think he will consider putting on a parka?  This is not a logical choice because he knows that historically it is not sufficiently cold in Chicago in July to warrant wearing a winter coat.  Next, he might turn on the radio or television to listen to the weather forecast.  The forecaster is predicting clear skies with temperatures around 90F.  Based on this information, our trader has reached a decision: he will wear a short sleeve shirt with no sweater or jacket, and he certainly won't need an umbrella.  However, just to be sure, he decides to take a look out the window to see what the people outside are wearing.  To his surprise, everyone is wearing a coat and carrying an umbrella.  The people outside, through their clothing, are implying completely different weather.  What clothes should the trader wear?  He must make some decisions, but whom should he believe, the weather forecaster or the people in the street?  There can be no certain answer because the trader will not know the future weather until the end of the day.  - Options Volatility & Pricing


Volatility comes in two basic stripes: historical and implied.  Historical volatility is also called realized volatility.  It refers to an objectively calculated formula that measure the standard deviation of an underlying instrument.  Implied volatility refers to the volatility implied by the price of the option.  The value of an option is calculated by a somewhat complex formula that includes several fixed variables such as price of the underlying instrument, strike price of the option, time until expiration, dividends, and cost of carry, as well as moving variable - the volatility of the option.  But if we know the price of the option, as we do for everything that trades, we can then work backwards and calculate an implied volatility of that option.  An implied volatility represents the best guess of the "market" of the volatility of the underlying between now and when the option expires. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings


**Volatility Characteristics**

If we were to generalize about volatility characteristics from the Deutschemark volatility in [Figure 14-2](https://imgur.com/a/SZjt2oa), we might surmise that an underlying contract is likely to have a typical long-term average, or mean volatility.  Moreover, the volatility of the underlying contract appears to be mean reverting.  When volatility rises above the mean, one can be fairly certain that it will eventually fall back to its mean.
[Notice](https://imgur.com/a/jjasHg2) that the fluctuations in implied volatility are usually less than the fluctuations in historical volatility.  When the historical volatility declined, the implied volatility rarely declined by an equal amount.  Because volatility tends to be mean reverting, when historical volatility is above its mean there is a greater likelihood that it will decline, and when historical volatility is below its mean there is a greater likelihood it will increase.
[We can see](https://imgur.com/a/KyYUgVs) that with a great deal of time remaining to expiration, the future volatility of the underlying contract (the solid line) is relatively stable.  but as we get closer to expiration the future volatility can become much less stable.  This is logical if we again recall that the mean reverting characteristics of volatility are much less certain over short periods of time than over long periods.  One large move in the underlying contract with only several days remaining to expiration will result in a sharp increase in the volatility to expiration (14-9C).  On the other hand, if the underlying contract is relatively quiet over the last several days in an option's life, the volatility to expiration will collapse. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings


**How do Traders Trade Volatility?**

If you are being chased by a bear, what is the key to getting away?  An old adage says that you don't have to actually outrun the bear, you simply have to outrun at least one person who's with you.  Volatility in the S&P 500 averages about 20 over the course of history.  But let's say you buy a one-month option at a 40 volatility.  If realized volatility over the course of the month exceeds 40, you likely made money on the trade.  Or at the very least you made a wise decision owning options instead of stock.
Volatility serves as a proxy for the amount of money available in the options pool.  The deeper the pool, the greater the premiums.  For sellers, the better the price they receive and the wider the range of stock with which they can profit.  For buyers, all they care about or should care about, is whether realized volatility of the stock itself will prove higher than the volatility they paid.  An 80 volatility implies that the average day will see a 5 percent move (80/SQRT of 252) (252 trading days in a year).  Well, actually, it implies that two-thirds of the days will see moves under 5 percent and that one-third will see moves above and beyond that.  
As a general rule, net selling options at a higher volatility than they ultimately realize will prove profitable.  Likewise for net buying options at a lower volatility than realized.  One thing to do is ignore anyone who throws numbers out trying to "prove" how much better you have it selling options compared to buying them.  This tells an incomplete story. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings


**The VIX**

The time is 1993.  Bill Clinton is inaugurated.  The Buffalo Bills lose their third straight Super Bowl and run headstrong into a 4th.  The World Wide Web begins.  Nirvana releases "In Utero."  And the VIX was born.  The goal?  To provide a handy estimate of the implied volatility of a 30-day at-the-money option on the S&P 100 Index, also known as the OEX.   By 2003, the S&P 500 supplanted the OEX as the most popular index.  So on September 23, a new VIX was born that had a new underlying index, SPX, and a completely new methodology. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings


**They Don't Hedge What You Think They Hedge**

The Vix estimates the implied volatility of an ATM option in SPX with 30 days of duration.  A regular option on the SPX estimates the volatility of SPX itself between today and the day the option expires.  Say it's May.  You're looking at November options in SPX, and they trade at a 25 volatility.  That is the volatility the market anticipates between now and November expiration.  
A November VIX future?  Quite different.  That's an estimate of where the VIX will close on November expiration day.  So if in May, you buy or sell a VIX November future or option, you are simply betting on where the VIX will settle on the morning of November expiration.  A common misconception is that your bet is on volatility between May and November.  Wrong.  It's a bet on a single snapshot number that one day.  And since the VIX itself is an estimate of volatility 30 days forward, a May transaction in a November VIX contracts bets on where the market six month's hence will estimate volatility 30 days forward from there.  

Oh, and did I mention that VIX futures and options close on a different day from regular futures and options?  Yes, they expire 30 days ahead of the next month's regular expiration, which makes sense in a way since the VIX itself estimate the price of a 30-day option.  The problem is that we have some four-week cycles and some five-week cycles, so that puts VIX expiration on either the Wednesday before or the Wednesday after regular expiration, depending on where regular expiration one cycle out sits.  Confused?  You are not alone. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings


**What Can the VIX do for You?**

It can tell you an expected range in the underlying index, the SPX.  Remember though that is a probability, not a guarantee.  Market volatility expectations reside at the intersection of two factors: volatility of the component stocks and the degree to which they correlate.  The volatility surge in mid-2008 has as much to do with increased correlation as anything else - specifically, energy imploding alongside everything else. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings

They confirmed that the vehicle is “being reading for production.” They are building this from the ground up, so they are already ahead of companies like NKLA. I believe that they’ve already released an EV in China with joint venture with Panasonic. Toyota has been making hybrid (partially electric) vehicles for around 20 years so I would think that that gives them a foundation to build from for their EV sector.

Toyota’s vehicles are reliable and their stock price is not ridiculously high. I could see this EV venture giving their stock price a boost, just like the announcement of GM’s hummer gave them a rise. Personally I’d buy an EV from Toyota rather than GM because of my faith in their products.
