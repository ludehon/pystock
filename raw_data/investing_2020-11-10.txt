This article touches on a bunch of different topics, but the overall conclusion is that categorizing intangibles, such as research and development, as an expense rather than as an asset made sense when the U.S. economy was largely manufacturing. Today, with an information economy, in order to more accurately value a company, you need to include intangibles in the book value. When you do that, you find that value stocks have outperformed growth stocks up until 2016, rather than until 2006.

I'm not sure I agree with that. First, there are tons of challenges in valuing intangible assets. Second, if a company is spending money on R&D, that is in fact an expense. It shouldn't become an asset just because it's "R&D." So much in R&D expenses end up going nowhere. There has to be a better way to factor R&D expense into a valuation than morphing it into an asset.

The article also talks about how GAAP applies inconsistent treatment to a company's own R&D versus an acquisition--in the former, intangibles are an expense; in the latter, intangibles are an asset. This might be an actual problem with GAAP, as the figure that comes out as "goodwill" is arbitrary. But don't most value investors ignore goodwill anyway?

Also, he says that the traditional definition of a value stock is a company with a low price-to-book ratio. Again, I don't agree with that either. That might have been the metric Ben Graham used back in the early 20th century, but today, I'd define "value" as any other good investment--paying less than what you get. For a long-term holding, that's most likely going to be discounted future cash flows. In fact, I usually don't care what the book value is in those types of investments.

It seems like the argument of "value vs. growth" is based largely on semantics. At the end of the day, investing, whether it's value or growth, is very simple--paying less than what you get._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on JD Stock?

I buy several times a week from them but I'm the biggest enemy of Amazon Choice and Best Seller .
I used to sort by reviews/stars but now sends you to unrelated items. Even though many fake reviews. 

LONDON (AP) ‚Äî European Union regulators have filed antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using data to gain an unfair advantage over merchants using its platform.
The EU's executive commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday that the charges have been sent to the company.
The commission said it takes issue with Amazon's systematic use of non-public business data to avoid ‚Äúthe normal risks of competition and to leverage its dominance" for e-commerce services in France and Germany, the company's two biggest markets in the EU.
The EU started looking into Amazon in 2018 and has been focusing on its dual role as a marketplace and retailer.

In addition to selling its own products, the U.S. company allows third-party retailers to sell their own goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.
Amazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.
‚ÄúWe disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,‚Äù the company said in a statement.
The company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.

It seems that every year some talking head is hailing the death of value investing and the ushering in of a new age of investing wherein none of the old ways work. Nothing these investors say is new or profound, as the same claims about value investing have been made over and over since Ben Graham was alive. The only thing that ever really changes in each cycle of value investment grave dancing is the new method of valuation pushed upon the reader, and even then these methods are remarkably similar to one another.

&#x200B;

The general structure of each argument is that the business and consumer world has massively shifted over a short period of time. This renders the old ways of balance sheet, income statement, and/or cash flow analysis no longer applicable due to government regulation, accounting practices, or investor sentiment being out of date with the times. This discrepancy between old ideas and "new era companies" is what has uncovered the gold mine that is the aforementioned new era set of companies that suddenly deserve a market cap that reaches into the stratosphere. This blindness towards what is "new and correct" is used to justify why most of the older and historically successful investors such as Buffett and Munger criticize the new hyped up idea and instead stick to their own ways. They are painted as dinosaurs soon to be outpaced by the new age investors forging on into the dawn of a new age.

&#x200B;

While it's always interesting to read into the newest cutting-edge ideas on how to invest, there's a good reason that Buffett and Munger haven't yet been overtaken by a young twenty or thirty-something boy-genius wielding a new and profound investment strategy. The reason, to put it simply, is that what makes companies good has, buy and large, always been the same mix of good earnings, a good corporate structure with a healthy balance sheet, and a good product that sells well. Yes, we have seen the proliferation of intangible assets on the balance sheet and massive changes in consumer consumption habits over the years, that is undeniable, but that doesn't mean that the central tenets of value investing are suddenly moot and unreliable. That isn't to say that value investing hasn't changed over the decades, it has. But these changes have come in small tweaks, not major overhauls.

Value investing isn't dead, nor will it ever die. It'll just continue to see small tweaks and changes to fit the gradually changing corporate world it is applied to.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You can forget about investing in Cincinnati Bell Hey guys, first time posting here. I‚Äôm a student and for one of my classes we have to perform ratio, strategy, and accounting analysis on a company given to us. Thought I‚Äôd post it here so I can get some sweet karma in addition to a B+

So I‚Äôve spent the last week combing a decade of Cincinnati Bell‚Äôs (CBB) previous 10k‚Äôs, reading any news article I could get my hands on, recasting, and doing SWOT and Porters Five analyses on CBB. 
Needless to say I think I know more about them than any other redditor on here (not true, but the lack of sleep and copious amounts of adderall tell me I‚Äôm right). I can say that this telecommunications company is headed nowhere fast. 

For one, they have an accumulated deficit of ($140 million) on their balance sheet that management seems to not give a shit about, as it‚Äôs been increasing steadily since at least 2011. They lag way behind the industry in liquidity (current ratio of .74) and haven‚Äôt turned a profit since 2017. They have a jaw dropping amount of debt (~2 billion), but I can‚Äôt even compute a D/E ratio because of their accumulated deficit. 

ROA? About .3 behind the rest of the industry. Asset Turnover? Not much better. Verizon accounts for almost a quarter of CBBs receivables as well, so fingers crossed nothing bad happens to one of their biggest competitors.

But the whopper is their interest coverage ratio. IT‚ÄôS .6. Their EBIT only covers 60% of their interest needs  each year. Unless I‚Äôm missing something, this is a recipe for perpetual debt and eventually bankruptcy. 

Apart from the numbers, they‚Äôve put all (or most) of the geographical eggs in one basket. They service a depressed part of a rust belt state that people are leaving in droves. They did acquire Hawaiian Telecom in 2018. Not that the revenue from that acquisition has exceeded the costs of integration yet. Hurray for another 1 million potential customers I guess. (Not mentioning that a single F5 or typhoon could wipe out half their infrastructure.)

Competitors? One of them is probably providing the data allowing you to read this post. They‚Äôre big, can spend wayyyyy more on PP & E, and have wireless divisions, unlike CBB.

Credit where it‚Äôs due: CBB honestly made a valiant effort to get into the fiber optics game back In the 2000s but it was too little too late; there‚Äôs no way they can compete with Google, AT&T, and Verizon‚Äôs expenditures on fiber cable. 

One more thing guys: 

CBB earns a fifth of its revenue from landline services. If you‚Äôre wondering if that‚Äôs a good thing or not try to remember the last time you used a god damn landline.

I could continue to trash Cincy Bell for a few thousand more words but I‚Äôm tired and want to smoke a bowl and hit the sack. If u want a full report email my professor lol. If I haven‚Äôt convinced you yet then you‚Äôre either my grandpa who still owns dusty Bell Telephone shares or are smarter than me, in which case buy that shit and pm me a few years from now to let me know how it went. 

TL;DR: grab your landline, call your broker, tell him to sell your CBB.

Global sales rose 2.7 per cent in the third quarter to $94.4 million, the company said Monday in a statement. That compared to the $132.1 million average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also reported a net loss of 28 cents a share, after excluding some items. Analysts had projected a profit of 5 cents.

‚ÄúFor the first time since the pandemic began, we experienced the full brunt and unpredictability of COVID-19 on our net revenues,‚Äù Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said.

The shares plunged in late trading following a volatile session

Shares fell 28 per cent as of 5:24 p.m. in late New York trading.

Beyond Meat has tried to pivot to in-store sales as the pandemic has battered the restaurant industry, which had accounted for about half of the company‚Äôs sales at the start of the year. But even at-home demand took a pause this quarter, as the panic buying and freezer stockpiling that drove demand earlier in the year generally has subsided, the company said.

On a call with analysts, company executives said that consumers‚Äô behavior was unpredictable in the third quarter, with purchases happening in large lumps. While there‚Äôs been some recovery in restaurant demand, the company says it‚Äôs too early to predict whether that persists. Beyond Meat still doesn‚Äôt have guidance for the year.

The maker of plant-based meat continues to bet on restaurants as a source of growth, however. Earlier Monday, Beyond Meat said it collaborated in the creation of new patties for McDonald‚Äôs Corp.‚Äôs new McPlant line. He said Beyond Meat, which fell sharply earlier Monday after McDonald‚Äôs didn‚Äôt mention the faux-meat maker in its announcement of the line, has a strong relationship with the fast-food chain.

Investment Plans

Brown said the disappointing quarter will not slow down the company‚Äôs investment plans.

‚ÄúRather than curtail activities in reaction to transitory macroeconomic conditions, we continue to invest in the pillars of our future growth, and in capabilities, infrastructure, and markets that support our global vision,‚Äù Brown said in the statement. He cited investments in factories in Europe and China, plus the next iteration of the Beyond Burger as examples.

‚ÄúThese initiatives brought expense during a period of disruption to our top-line, but we are confident in our belief that they will deliver strong long-term gains in enterprise value,‚Äù he said.

I've read a few articles online that somewhat touch on the issue ([this is one example](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120515/infinite-economic-growth-finite-planet-possible.asp)) but I didn't feel like I was any closer to answering any of my questions afterward. Anyone in here that cares to share their thoughts on this topic?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Questions concerning AMD and INTC stock So I have stock in INTC and AMD and today has been a weird day and I am trying to work out what happened. So I know if stock goes up and down it affects the NASDAQ index, but somehow it works the otherway around aswell. Intel was at 3-4% green for a long time, but at the end of the day NASDAQ tanked and so did intel and AMD. How does the falling of big companies like FB and AAPL affect the stocks on AMD and INTC.
