Seriously, why are you doing this.  It seems like a complete kamikaze of your portfolio.  Are you really not afraid of 50-75% capital depreciation?  There is no force on Heaven, Earth, or Hell that could justify this valuation.  At least during the tech bubble new traders could claim they were naive, but now almost everyone sees the impending doom incoming and you just stand there with your shares like its a complete joke.

Tesla will also be added to the S&P 100, replacing Occidental Petroleum in that index.

S&P Dow Jones Indices previously announced on Nov. 16 that Tesla would join the S&P 500. Tesla's size — it's the largest company ever to be added to the benchmark index — prompted the index provider to seek feedback from the investment community over whether to add Tesla all at once or in two separate tranches.

S&P Dow Jones Indices ultimately decided on the former, announcing on Nov. 30 that it would add Tesla at its full float-adjusted market cap on Dec. 21.

"In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market's ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date," the index provider said. Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices of Friday Dec. 18, coinciding with the expiration of stock options and stock futures, which should help facilitate the addition because of the high trading volume, S&P said.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has not yet announced Tesla's weighting in the index.

There's currently over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, with roughly $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds, meaning significant portfolio adjustments will have to be made to make room for Tesla.

According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, $80 billion worth of Tesla stock will have to be bought by index investors. He noted that trading volatility could be exacerbated by Tesla not being a member of the  S&P 1500, S&P 400 Midcap or S&P 600 Small Cap indices.

Funds managers that must buy the index will try to buy Tesla as near the Dec. 18 closing price as possible. "It's probably going to be one of the biggest market on close buy orders of all time," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.

We have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits over the last few months. Last Monday 12/7 I made a post outlining the data we collected and our predictions.  You can view the original Post here [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/k87oso/1211_contract_analysis/)

Just to recap the data collected for the analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  We scraped comments and posts on reddit that mentioned stock contracts that expired today 12/11. The goal of the project is to see how reddit preforms picking contracts… Is reddit right or wrong.  

My hypothesis is that for the most part reddit will be wrong.  So, selling the most popular contracts will be a profitable investment.  Just to be clear this is a hypothesis and not something I actually traded.  The idea here is that if I start the week selling the most popular contracts, I will end the week profitable.  

In my previous post I said I would sell the 370 SPY 12/11 Calls and the 600 TSLA 12/11 Calls Monday morning.  The SPY Calls would have netted me $210 premium and the TSLA calls $2500 premium.  The SPY calls would have ended up 100% profitable as spy closed this week at $366.30.  The Tesla calls would have been 60% profitable as TSLA closed the week at 609.99.  So, if I would have sold one of each my total profit for the week would have been $1710.  Not bad for one week.  

Additional Data: 


Most Popular calls that were in the money as of last weekend

* TSLA 570 – 590, Week closed at 609.99
* ACB 10, Week closed at 9.91

Overall the vast majority of contracts reddit mentioned ended the week out of the money.  Out of the most popular call contracts mentioned, only TSLA 600 ended partially in the money and that’s only if you covered the premium.  All of the most popular puts that were out of the money ended out of the money.  ACB calls that were in the money ended out of the money by .09.  Popular puts that were in the Money were all NKLA and they did end in the money.  135 ended out of the money and 51 ended in the money.

Is there an app that tracks my investments profit-loss without having to log-in to my account all the time? For security reasons while on the go, I don't want to log-in all the time.

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Learned my lesson- Disney I posted on here a couple of weeks ago asking people’s opinion on Disney and Apple saying I thought they could really go up. Some people said that they saw no way that they would reach the levels that I thought they would. I mistakenly listened to internet strangers and sold all my Disney stock to put into other plays. This week Disney is up over $20. A lot of great advice on here but this hurt. Lesson learned, when you have a hunch and do some dd, stick to your guns and don’t assume other people in here know what they’re talking about, the stock market is unpredictable in most cases and stonks only go up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could PLTR face the same downtrend as other meme stock NIO? Listen, 

I know their circumstances are different in so many ways in terms of the industries they're in, where they are based (US vs. China), etc etc.

However, as a meme stock they are similar in terms of the following analysis: Both stock meme'd and ran up hard, only to be shorted by citron, cooling off and then running back up to ATH yet again. 

Since it's 2nd peak, NIO has cooled off significantly, and I'm talking about before the offering yesterday which obviously caused a sell-off. 

PLTR is in a similar situation, as it tested ATH earlier this week again, sold off and has somewhat stabilized. 

&#x200B;

I just want to get my money back and move on to next play. It seems like this stock will build for a few days then on the one red day it will lose its gains. Can we expect further growth for AAPL or is its best days behind it?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did I start investing in tech companies now? I was always planning to start investing my money, and one month ago, I finally started investing because I think this is the best time to start. As a total beginner, I want to share why I decided to start now and why I decided to invest in the tech. All these are my personal opinions/predictions and not financial advice.
Why now?

Covid-19 changed many things quickly, and we started to see a totally different world. I am 32 years old, and until this year, I have never seen so many changes happened at light speed. Probably for a lot of businesses speed of growth accelerated at unbelievable levels. Especially in the tech industry. I will try to explain my logic for different cases.

##Ecommerce started to be the default option.
People started buying everything online as a default option. Most people who were hesitant to online shopping also now tried it and probably loved its simplicity. We saw the latest reports of e-commerce companies, and it shows the huge growth. This is why it is logical to start investing in some online shopping platforms like Amazon.
Ecommerce software providers.
Another side of this story is e-commerce software providers like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Magento, etc. Many people started moving their offline businesses online, and many people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic started looking for opportunities to make money online. One of the best options to make money online is e-commerce. This is why e-commerce software providers gained an unbelievable amount of customers recently. You can see how much money all Shopify stores made in the total on Black Friday. $5.1B 😱 It was $2.9B last year. It is a ~75% increase. 📈💰

##They are learning.
These numbers show huge growth already, but I think we haven’t seen the pandemic's real effect yet. The logic is simple, all this pandemic situation started around March, and if you probably count, most people didn’t understand how serious the situation. It took several months to realize what is going on. We are now in December, and it was only around 10 months now and all we know that learning e-commerce, creating a store, learning SEO, learning advertisement platforms, etc., have some learning curve, and it requires hard-work, experience, and time. Some of these people already started to make some good sales, but some are still learning and experimenting. It is just a matter of time for them to start being successful. After all, these brand new merchants will start to make a lot of sales it will also bring a lot of money (commissions/upgrade of packages) to e-commerce providers like Shopify. This is why I invested in Shopify. It will also have a butterfly effect and will start to grow other platforms that are providing services to online shop owners. I will list some of these platforms below.

##Platforms to hire freelancers.
Many freelancers on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are providing digital services also will start to see a lot of demand in their craft. People will need someone who will make a logo and banners for their shop; they will need some developers and designers to customize their stores. And this is not the only service for online stores, but as remote work is a new standard now, companies increased the number of remote workers, and more people are being hired from these platforms then more commissions these platforms will start to gain. This is why I am also investing in Fiverr and Upwork.

##Software infrastructure providers.
As all these online business platforms and traffic on the internet increase, platforms like Cloudflare, Amazon Web Services, etc., also gain many new customers. These new customers are also slowly growing and learning and will finally use more services and upgrade their packages. This is why great companies like Amazon and Cloudflare are introducing a lot of cool stuff worth investing in.
The world is changed forever.
I think even if 1–2 years later Covid-19 won’t be part of our life's anymore the effects it brings to the world will stay forever. A lot of business owners were hesitant about working from home but they have seen it is possible and can be quite efficient. It is possible now to hire key people remotely and rely on them. All these lessons won’t go away after a pandemic and will stay with us together. Most people who learn to run online businesses won’t go back offline again as this is the brand new skill they learn in difficult times and they will only invest more in these skills. Also, people who started to use online services (like shopping) won’t be hesitant to it anymore and they will continue to use them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can’t use two indicators at IQ Options ,why?

Would you do it or not? Why/why not? If you don’t know what it is, you are ‘betting’ that a currency/stock will go up or down. E.g for each point a stock moves up, you would gain 0.1.

I want to skip the run-of-the-mill criteria under which stock opportunities tend to be assessed and get straight to the subjective.

Pandemic is passing and people will want to leave their home - increase in face-to-face business agreements will decrease demand for the main service, electronic signatures. I understand how e-signatures are a growing business opportunity, since people will probably see the appeal  but I do not see the growth that is projected through the stock price just yet. I mean, the main product is a plan for e-signatures. It seems very pie-in-the-sky to me, at this moment, at least. I am sure there is a solid niche for this company to keep expanding within, but I do not see this happening in the next year or so. For this company to grow that the rate projected through the market price, we would need widespread adoption of the product, but seeing that the economy is  in a recession, I simply do not see this happening yet. The rate, at which money is switching hands between companies, is coming to a slow. I am pretty sure that is correlated to the degree that people/companies are signing documents, ... well at least most companies. With economic growth slowing down and companies going out of business, I can simply not see the degree of growth projected. I understand that innovations are important for any company to look out for right now to save costs, but I believe that a a subscription plan for electronic signatures is one of the last concerns for a vast amount of companies out there for the year to come.

Then there is, of course, the PE ratio, which is just astronomical.

I work for Sainsbury's and have the option to join their share investment plan (not sharesave). -a maximum of £125 a month.

My other option is to invest in a S&S ISA, which gives me a bit more flexibility and allows for more diversification of my investment

I generally feel Sainsbury's shares should be relatively safe bet... I don't expect them to increase a huge amount, and should there be any losses, I still think I'd come out on top given the tax relief after 5 years.

Has chance to surpass 300 in next two years, if 2024 streaming target is on course (constantly add >10 million subscriber per quarter) + post covid pent up demand for park.**

&#x200B;

First, this is my first post in this sub, but not my first prediction post on DIS. I have been predicting DIS rise since 4 months ago, including various posts in various subs before ER, and another one yesterday right before investor event --- which are all right on spot (see my post history). My last post was removed by WSB for no obvious reason, so I decide to give it a try here. Feel free to reverse me if you wish though.

Second, the investor day yesterday is an excellent one:  much more contents to DIS +; >10M subscriber increase in just 2 months; targets >200M for DIS + subscriber & >300M total by 2024; and subscription price increase. As DIS hits its own target, its streaming business will be far larger than NFLX now. So the market cap should be NFLX + Park + unique DIS brand, I would say 400-500B at least, or 250-300.

But stock price won't get there over a week (unless WSB meme it up). I first posted my DIS prediction during the summer, yet stock price action has been very uninteresting despite the imminent growth picture. This reminds me of AMZN cloud that pushes it from 500-1500 in two years, and TSLA during 2019. So long DIS+ keeps on its growth trajectory by adding >10M subsciber per quarter, then they are on course to their 2024 target --> stock price will easily rise to >200 during early 2021.

Finally, park pent-off demand will appear during 2021, as Covid curve being controlled by vaccine and better treatment. If this demand does not conflict with DIS + growth, then DIS has a good chance to trade above 250 or even 300.

&#x200B;

My core position in DIS: holding 2022 leaps since summer. Will hold til 2022 or if DIS breaks 420 next year.

My suggested position: 2022 or 2023 leaps (I have been constantly suggesting this during my previous DIS predictions, which tripled since summer). Say 2023 Jan 200 call, I think they have a good chance to triple next year. And don't bet on weeklies.

Potential risk: Macro uncertainty is always there for options. Also, if DIS+ subscriber increase is slower than 10M per quarter, stock may take a hit for that particular quarter (but vice versa if they can add 20M per quarter stock will moon even harder)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Microsoft as an investment stock ?

First timer, I want to buy about 800$ of call options on a stock. The stock is currently trading at about $63 a share, but I think it will go up over the next week. I'm looking to buy the current strike price option of $62.50 for $1.98 premium. So, I should be able to get about 4 of those contracts with my 800$.

Here's my 2 things I want to verify:

1. ) If I buy these 4 contracts, can I sell them back to the market at any time, even if I don't have 100 shares of the underlying stock? I don't own any of the stock, I just want to buy and sell the contract for these option
2. ) The maximum amount of money I can lose here is my 800$ that I spend on the call option, correct?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apple vs. Paypal So I'm just curious as to what people think. I know the two companies aren't exactly related, although Apples does have apple pay, but I doubt it will ever be a serious threat to Paypal.

I haven't done too much research yet, but one thing that's important to me is (cash+short term investments)/long term debt, and pypl seems to be in the better position there as of end of Sept.. Apple's ratio isn't bad though. 

As for P/E, pypl is at 65.83 given trailing 3 Q's + Q4 low estimates and share price @ 210. Aapl is at 36.59 given FY20 earnings and share price @ 120. (I know this isn't a perfect comparison given that a calculated the P/Es differently). Both companies have had consistent earnings growth for years. 

YTD pypl is up 94.76% and aapl is up 67.87%.

It seems to me that Paypal has greater growth potential than Apple, but that's just my initial take.

I know this isn't exactly a complete breakdown of the two companies, but like I said, I just wanna know what you guys think.

The financial system is doomed to die, because we are already in a state of hyperinflation ([https://www.goldmoney.com/research/goldmoney-insights/hyperinflation-is-here).](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/goldmoney-insights/hyperinflation-is-here).)  Alasdair Macleod says that we have mere months left to go. The bond  market is necessarily going to crash, because interest-rates can never  go up again without destroying the system and making the budget  unserviceable; this means that a never-ending vicious circle of  quantitative easing and monetizing the debt is on the way, until the  dollar finally gets dumped. Russia and China are preparing to issue  gold-backed rubles and yuan, and have accumulated sufficient gold  reserves to do so.  


It is hopeless to trust in an economic  recovery. Unless the money-printing stops and the whole system is  allowed to crash--which the bankers will never allow--the middle class  will continue to get wiped out. Real unemployment is already 40%. (See  ShadowStats.) High inflation from inevitable U. B. I. will only make  matters even worse.  


The next catalyst for gold and silver going  higher will inevitably be the stimulus bill, but there might be a  banking crisis, a currency crisis, or a COMEX default even before then._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Plurilock Security (PLUR.v) I haven't seen anyone mention this one before.

They basically have an authentication system driven by AI analyzing your typical way of using the computer. The time of day, the device ID's, your normal usage on that site/app, where you usually have your cursor, etc. It combines all that info to determine if it is you - or a bot across the world.   


We all know there are vulnerabilities with sim swapping and 2FA, and passwords, etc. But this is different because it understands the user and there isn't any verification to be entered. It's all automated on the back-end.   


I work with a lot of different businesses, and password management is a nightmare. People don't understand how easy it is to hack into stuff, especially if you have a weak password. I've honestly seen multiple passwords to banking info, or high level services with passwords of "dogsname123". Oh, and the number of people that refuse 2FA even because it's too complicated...

They draw two lines on the chart within which the stock has been trading, call the one on the bottom support and the one on the top resistance, and say that the stock cannot drop below support or move above resistance. Of course, the support and resistance lines are routinely violated, at which point the technical analyst will say "resistance has become support" or some nonsense, instead of admitting that the line they drew did not predict future prices.

They actually will look for images in a chart, like an astrologist looking for patterns among the star. If there is a head and shoulders, they think the stock will move one way. If there is a cup and handle, the stock will move another direction. This alone totally discredits the entire field of technical analysis. It is embarrassing. If the stock moves in the opposite direction than their divination spell predicted, do they admit that there was no predictive power? Of course not, they just tell themselves that on closer inspection, it wasn't a real head and shoulders.

If technical analysis actually worked, it would be no different than any other arbitrage scenario: all of the high tech trading firms would have already automated it with their billions of dollars and the arbitrage opportunity would have been eliminated. But these hedge funds and professional traders routinely fail to deliver a greater return than the S&P 500.

Just think about it: if support actually worked you could yolo a relatively large portion of your portfolio into long calls when the stock was testing the the support line. If resistance actually worked you could do the same with long puts when the stock was testing the resistance line. You and everyone else would be insanely rich. Except that if it actually worked, no one would write calls or write puts near the support and resistance lines when these lines were being tested, or they would demand insane premium for the risk. But in real life, support and resistance don't work, so option sellers feel comfortable writing options at these levels, and don't even bother to demand extraordinary premium for the risk. In fact, the IV of an option at a certain level doesn't even correlate to the support and resistance lines, which means that the vast majority of buyers aren't even attempting this.

The only people who benefit from technical analysis are book sellers and youtube influencers who failed to make any money in the stock market, and decided to scam new investors.

> The Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. In fiscal year 2019, the Company generated $3.4 billion in revenues and $312.6 million in net income attributable to Darling.

~ 10% profit margin is good, but we'll see why it's good later on. 

I was initially drawn to this company because I had heard a lot of good things about insect proteins. For those who haven't heard, compared to all sources of protein (Cows, chicken, pigs, fish, plants etc.) insect protein is the least resource intensive. It's safe to say based on several macro economic factors that high-protein, low resource sustainable food sources should have a lot of room for growth, if not for human consumption initially, it can be fed to other animals. 

Darling had recently acquired Enviroflight LLC:

> EnviroFlight, LLC is a leading developer of proprietary technologies which enable the rearing of non-pathogenic black soldier fly (BSF) larvae in a scalable manner. This innovative and responsible approach has considerable potential within the sizable global animal feed industry as it will provide an environmentally-friendly, toxin-free, sustainable source of high-value nutrients.

Based on this headline, I decided to look a bit deeper into the company. 

[Here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654020000007/dar-2019122810xk.htm#s6F2E4BD8B31358CDA46384F9F5472600) is the 10K for 2019.

You'll see that revenues in the past 5 years actually show negative growth. But Net Income had grown by 300% from 2018-19. I saw no large settlement, sale of assets (20m sale of business segments would only explain 6% of the change), or drop in expenses - SG&A had in fact increased sizably. 

The culprit was a joint venture called Diamond Green Diesel. The net income from Darling's 50% stake was >$360m, up over 100% from the year prior, and 1300% from 2017. 

In the 3 months trailing 9/26/20, net income attributable to Diamond Green Diesel is up 80% from the same three months last year. Hence the current price run. 

What is Diamond Green Diesel? 

> a biodiesel facility and is a partner with Valero Energy Corporation in Diamond Green Diesel, a renewable diesel facility, both of which convert used cooking oils and animal fats into valuable biofuel products.

Renewable Diesel sounds good, what is it?

> Renewable diesel is made from responsible and sustainable feedstock, such as used cooking oil, rendered animal fats and inedible corn oil. It is molecularly the same as petroleum-based diesel and it meets the ASTM International’s standard for Diesel Fuel Oils (D-975).

> Renewable diesel is a clean-burning, drop-in fuel (chemically identical to standard diesel) that can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80%. It is 100% compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.

Sounds like the government might like to have Green Diesel replace regular diesel. Funny you should mention that:

> For 2019, 2018 and 2017, biodiesel blenders registered with the Internal Revenue Service were eligible for a tax incentive in the amount of $1.00 per gallon of renewable diesel blended with petroleum diesel to produce a mixture containing at least 0.1% diesel fuel. In December 2019, this $1.00 per gallon blenders tax credit was reinstated retroactively for calendar years 2018 and 2019 and extended for calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Diamond Green/Darling is currently building facilities to increase its production 6 fold.

Let me know ya'lls thoughts_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My first experience buying stocks or how I remember so called privatization aka IPO in ex-USSR I'm from ex-USSR and in 1991 we became independent country and couple of years after there was so called privatization, process when government owned companies became publicly traded. At the beginning all companies where government owned and there was a need to move away from that model. So during privatization any citizen were able to participate in this process and get some shares. Not all companies became publicly trade eventually and some are still controlled by government. To participate in privatization you need to have so called certificates, this certificates were given to everybody by government and if I'm correct you were not able to use your cash for this process. So when I was 13 years old I proposed my grandmother to get some stock instead of those certificates. To get shares we will needed to go to state owned bank and fill a lot of paper work and if I remember correctly then you can make a bid, for example for one stock you are willing to give not more then 10 certificates or you can use so called market-order. We tried to get stocks in several companies, but as far as I remember we got stocks only in that one energy company, because we used so called market order, limit orders were unsuccessful, as far as I remember. My grandmother had a lot of those certificates and for stocks she used just very small amount and she was hoping that she will be able to get a lot of money from those certificates, but eventually she never sold any of those, for high or low price and I think at the end they just vanish. All what she got was that stocks from energy company, what I helped to get. Nevertheless she was watching too much news and sometimes there was bad or good news and at the end she sold them and I don't even know when, she just told me that she was afraid that company will go bankrupt. But that company is still there and seems to be ok. So this is my personal first experience buying stocks, probably a bit different from regular experience in western countries.

Disney hiked its five-year streaming subscriber estimates on Thursday, expecting Disney+ to continue to post remarkable growth.

The company now forecasts 230 million to 260 million subscribers to Disney+ by 2024. 

Upon its launch 13 months ago, Disney said it expected the platform to reach 60 million to 90 million subscriptions by 2024.

Thanks for the award._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GWPH - Cannabis/Pharma Play - Undervalued Wanted to turn you all onto this stock. GWPH is super undervalued right now.

GWPH developed a cannabis derived oral application to treat pediatric epilepsies. Before the pandemic they just started selling their product Epidiolex, which was granted FDA approval for  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. They just got another approval for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

This stock was trading at $180 before the pandemic, and is now only at $125.

In 2019 they did $319M. In 2020 they are expected to hit $500M, and this is without the revenues from Tuberous Sclerosis sales. BOA did a report on them at expects revenues to increase to $2.2 BILLION by 2027 and gave them a PT of $234.

They are expected to turn a profit Q1 2021

Super undervalued stock IMO, I expect this to be at $180 by next earnings.

What’s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good morning! So let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.

Almost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil & gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.

The numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.

Better numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.

Also, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year’s month.

[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.

We also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old’s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don’t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.

So, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let’s talk about them a little.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.

[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.

The company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.

The company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.

Next let’s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.

A smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave & Buster’s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.

Moving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.

The other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn’t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don’t really have a great grasp of the company’s growth potential is right now.

We also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company’s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.

The company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.

They plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.

They presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.

But they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema’s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.

So, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \+7,5% in pre-market.

Disney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).

Also, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.

So, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.

AirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot & Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. 

I would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.

While my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I’d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Patient Investors: BlackBerry (TSX:BB) Could Blast off in 2021 Patient Investors: BlackBerry (TSX:BB) Could Blast off in 2021

You don’t need to pay an arm and a leg to get a front-row seat to the most lucrative areas of the tech market: just have a look at BlackBerry (TSX:BB)(NASDAQ:BB) stock. The name is quite possibly the cheapest established tech play that’s engaged in areas of tech such as cybersecurity, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Enterprise Software Services (ESS).

Your patience will likely be rewarded in a big way

Undoubtedly, BlackBerry is a name that’ll test your patience. Long-term investors who’ve held BlackBerry stock have been proven wrong thus far, as the company has yet to prove that it can sustain high organic growth. BlackBerry CEO John Chen isn’t just a great man to have at the helm. He’s also turnaround artist who can make the company great again.
Given the profound transformative efforts, BlackBerry is a turnaround play that’s not for the faint of heart, as it could take many years for the firm to land the magnitude of multiple expansion that deep-value investors seek.
In prior pieces, I urged investors to stick with the name that begged for investor patience:
“BlackBerry isn’t at the end of the road, even though its valuation suggests it’s on its way out. The company is still in the midst of its major transformation, which, if successful, will allow patient investors to profit from some serious multiple expansion,” I wrote at the start of July when the stock was trading at $6 and change.

Basically, because I work 3 days during the week I don't have time to set up my buy order and a stop loss in the morning. My strategy is simple. Buy stocks with a significant price target increase and in a bullish context for the week right at the market open. Then set tight trailing stop losses to help me ride the wave and get me out once the trend changes. I would like to set these conditions up about an hour before open so I have time to go to work. I know conditionals exist but every time I try it says i dont have the stock at this moment and cancels the condition.

Thanks Fam!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quantitatively Discovering Moats With A Simple Score - Cashflows / Assets - Helped Me Find a 300% Return (With Link to Data) Hey everyone! I have been receiving a lot of great feedback about my Analyst Score (links below) so I wanted to share a different score that I've been tracking / working on to get some thoughts from the community. 

In short, the score takes five years of free cash flows and divides them by total assets. Is it a foolproof score? No. But what it does do is help **quantitatively discover moats.** 

Why? Well we want businesses to generate cash. If they're generating a big pile of cash on few assets then that business would be ripe for competition. That is unless, of course, that business had a moat of some kind. 

The score helped me discover **Collector's Universe** (CLCT) earlier in the year and I made over a 300% return on that. It also got me to add **Verisign** (VRSN) to my watchlist and I ended up making a 21% return on that after its pandemic drop with the broader market. 

So, here is a link to the Cash Flows / Total Assets score for every company I have that data for today. Word of warning though, financials and trusts can sometimes have weird balance sheets, so I've been avoiding them. 

**Link to the data**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRNnLmjEK4T\_n\_0iGsiO74w2a6RfYQK-FW1M7nAyMJY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRNnLmjEK4T_n_0iGsiO74w2a6RfYQK-FW1M7nAyMJY/edit?usp=sharing)

What does the community think? Useful metric, or lucky break with CLCT? I can tell you from looking at the list this time around that I am taking a deeper look into Manhattan Associates (MANH) and Medifast (MED). Both look like they're on fantastic runs of late.

Below are links to the Analyst Score stuff mentioned above. The data for the Analyst Score is getting pricier and harder to come by so I may have to run quarterly, but will post here when I get it run again.

What is this company?
	"Village Farms International, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, produces, markets, and distributes greenhouse-grown tomatoes, bell peppers, and cucumbers in North America. It operates through three segments: Produce Business, Energy Business, and Cannabis and Hemp Business. The company also owns and operates a 7.0 megawatt power plant that generates and sells electricity to British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority; and produces and supplies cannabis products. It markets and distributes its products under the Village Farms brand name to retail supermarkets and fresh food distribution companies, as well as products produced under exclusive arrangements with other greenhouse producers."
	TLDR: Greenhouse grower of vegetables, hemp and cannabis. Also owns a 7 megawatt powerplant. That means it's not only a weed company; not all the eggs are in the same basket.
 
Why would someone invest in it?

	-Investopedia rates it amongst the best value marijuana stock on the NASDAQ with some good recent  news and a promising future.(https://www.investopedia.com/investing/top-marijuana-stocks-nasdaq/)
	-Newly 100% owner of Pure sunfarm (a cannabis company selling in Ontario and some other provinces).
	-Village Farms is one of the largest and longest-operating greenhouse growers in North America, and is leveraging its decades of experience in large-scale, low-cost intensive agriculture and as a vertically integrated produce supplier to pursue high-value, high-growth,  plant-based Consumer Packaged Good opportunities in cannabis and CBD in North America and selective markets internationally
 
	-It already has a foot in the US market in the U.S. Subject to compliance with all applicable U.S. federal and state laws, Village Farms is pursuing a strategy to become a leading developer and supplier of branded and white-labeled CBD products targeting “big box” and other major retailers and consumer packaged good companies. With one of the largest greenhouse operations in the country, it is well positioned for the potential federal legalization of high-THC cannabis. 
	Michael DeGiglio, the chief executive officer of Village Farms International, during a 2020 third-quarter financial results call, said: “Once we launch in Texas, we will be sort of first in when assets are ready to go. We already have our conversion plans. We're ready to go in Texas. And that's the same population nearly as Canada and the way Texas is going is probably be very close the next few years. 
	So that in itself is like the Republic of Texas or a country, but that doesn't mean we won't work nationally. And we're prepared to look at, if we have to do acquisitions or strategic partnerships and other locations where we can bring our strengths to the table. I think there's a lot of opportunity there. We're pretty well-known. 
	As you know, Village Farms is, in principle, a U.S. company. That's where we are. So, it's like coming home, and we're excited about the array of possibilities for us." (https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/14/village-farms-international-inc-vff-q3-2020-earnin/)
 
	-Internationally, Village Farms is strategically targeting selected, nascent, legal cannabis and CBD opportunities with significant long-term potential, with an initial focus on the Asia-Pacific region through its investment in the Australia-based company, Altum International.
 
	-In August 2020, Village Farms acquired 6.6% of Altum, one of the Asia-Pacific region’s leading cannabinoid platforms.
 
What is Pure Sunfarm,the company they recently bought?
 
	-In Canada, the British-Columbia-based company, Pure Sunfarms, is one of the single largest cannabis operations in the world, the lowest-cost greenhouse producer, one of the best-selling brands, and has generated profitability for seven consecutive quarters.
 
	-Pure Sunfarms has received from Health Canada its Cannabis Research License to conduct human clinical administration trials for sensory evaluation of cannabis, enabling it to engage in on-site assessments of the taste, visual, smell or feel of its products at its Delta 3 cannabis facility in Delta, British Columbia.
 
	-Pure Sunfarms Brand Debuts Internationally in Hong Kong
Pure Sunfarms will be featured as part of a limited-edition Lane Crawford x Found CBD-infused gift set to be sold in the luxury department store’s holiday pop-up shops in Hong Kong this holiday season.
 
	-Pure Sunfarms signed up to supply a range of its branded, high quality, British Columbia-grown cannabis products to the customers of Medical Cannabis by Shoppers Inc., a subsidiary of Shoppers Drug Mart, which has over 1300 locations!
(stores.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/). (seekingalpha(dot)com/news/3639363-village-farms-subsidiary-inks-supply-agreement-medical-cannabis-shoppers)
 
Why would it give a good return?
 
	-With the new update, Sarugaser has reiterated his “Strong Buy 1” rating with a target price of US$20.00, which currently represents a projected 12-month return of 113 per cent.
	-Institutional Ownership:18.53%
	-Price target Low:  10.00, median 13.15, High 26.59 (from Barron on MarketWatch)
	-ATH: APR'19 @ 22.50+ , The COVID-19 pandemic hurt the company, but there are a lot of promising things coming in 2021 and 2022.

Option play: contracts for July 21 are still cheap. Sell around March-May. 
Leaps 2022 n 2023 as they have a lot of potential for the future.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

What are your thoughts on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MSFT or SNE (5 year Time Horizon) Currently hold each around 10%, but would like to consider dropping one in order to have more cash to invest in higher growth stocks. 

With roughly 10x the market cap, I’m not sure how much more Microsoft will grow in the next 5 years compared to Sony. However in the last 5 years (ending Jan 2020) MSFT beat SNE growth by approximately 40% (relatively, of course). The last few months SNE is up about 15%, while MSFT is running sideways.  

Which company do you think has more growth potential for the next 5-10 years? 

MSFT has cloud computing analytics (or will soon), SaaS, retail and commercial hardware/software, and many, many other strong branches of their company tethered to their fundamentals. They are so strong. 

SNE has (imo) a slight edge in their console technology (although not gaming ecosystem overall). They are deep in commercial electronics production. They are developing their streaming service. What else?

Especially in the travel industry Post COVID people are going to travel again: the travel industry WILL have a sales increase, and naturally revenue will be up -- but the bottom lines are going to be a disaster. This will also affect the suppliers.

For the better part of 2020 ships have been dry docking, and aircrafts have also been stuck on land. Yet the fixed costs of operations have continued to run, and companies have accumulated a staggering debt in the process. This debt has become so immense, that it casts a shadow of uncertainty over the affected companies.

And who are they in debt to? If aircraft lines and cruise lines start to go bankrupt, suppliers are going to struggle, because the debt is basically bills to the suppliers.

*(Note: The following is just my personal prediction. I am not a financial advisor)* Short term the stocks may rise due to optimism in the market. However long term, many companies are going to struggle, and worst case go bankrupt due to accumulated debt in 2020. This also means that suppliers wont get paid, and will struggle further on.

Brief back story:

-Mine in California that holds 15% of the worlds neodymium

-Neodymium is a metal that is formed into magnets that power electric motors

-Neodymium magnets are used in more than 80% of electric vehicles and is increasing.

-Also used in fighter jets, wind turbines, and basically anything that requires electric motors and efficiency.

-Physicists believe there is not a more powerful or more efficient magnet on the planet

-Tesla switched to Neodymium magnets for the Model 3 motors because of increased efficiency and weight savings

-The worlds Neodymium supply comes largely from China (85%)

-MP’s mine holds the other 15%

-China does not have enough supply for its own needs of neodymium moving forward 

-They have cut off supply to other countries in the past (Japan). 

-US military just granted 9mil to MP to reserve neodymium

-It’s already profitable as of now.

-Need for neodymium is almost certain to increase dramatically over the next 20-30 years.

-Costs about a billion dollars and about 3 years to start a new mine so tough to start up

-There are very few in the Western Hemisphere and only one at scale (MP)



Potential downsides:

China could squeeze them out by flooding market

California could screw them with environmental concerns. Evidently the processing has a lot of radioactive byproducts 

An alternate metal or new technology could arise

Now is a good time to invest._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $AI - C3.ai is the most underrated IPO this month For those of you haven’t checked out C3.ai yet you really need to do yourself a favour and take a peak.

I think it’s quite easy to write this one off without much though because it’s up like 150% in two days, but you’d be making a mistake.

I feel strongly that all the other major IPOs way over priced themselves and then still over performed, whereas $AI was priced a bit more appropriately and then over performed.

First off, their Harvard educated CEO is a big deal and has successfully raised a unicorn in the past. Competent leadership is the first thing you should look for when assessing a risky stock, and these guys check that box.

The quick and dirty explanation of why you should be interested in $AI is that in addition to their ongoing software contracts (Shell, Caterpillar, US Airforce etc) **C3 is partnering with Adobe and Microsoft to create a CRM that is driven by AI.**

For those of you who don’t know, a CRM is any piece of software that a company uses to manage and track clients, customers, sales, communications, emails, web posts, etc etc all in one spot.

Whenever you talk to a customer service rep and they are taking all your info and typing away, that person is working on a CRM.

I work with CRMs in my marketing business, and the fact that I am skilled in CRMs is the primary reason I am worth hiring for most of my clients. As a digital marketing contractor, my CRM skills are more important than my contributions on social media and web dev.

I am speaking from personal experience when I telling you, CRMs are a big deal. They are the back bone of e-commerce and digital workspaces.

The only major player that is soaking up CRM market share right now is Salesforce, which is currently worth a $200B.

Microsoft threw $50m into the IPO for $AI because they are in it for the long haul with these guys, and the investment was an attractive alternative other than a full takeover. 

You need to take note when Microsoft does things like this. Microsoft does not normally just yolo on IPOs. They are not an investment fund. They made this purchase with operational and relationship building intent.

With Microsoft and Adobe in the mix, you have everything you could possibly need to make a comprehensive and user friendly CRM that is powered by AI. More importantly, those two companies have their claws in every single private and public organization in the world.

Converting people to this new CRM they are making will be easy for them.

And if you want to completely ignore the AI CRM component of this company, you can also consider that C3.ai is also comparable to Palantir and Snowflake. Those stocks are worth $50B and $100B respectively.

With C3.ai trading at $12B, this one is a no brainer.

In today’s IPO mania, I see no reason this company doesn’t carry a $20B market cap very soon.

In the long run, I see this company as a potential very very smart investment.

Do not be discouraged by the insane growth it has already seen.

PS: I am in for shares at $119.50. It’s also worth noting I got into Palantir at $10 for 80% of my account back when everyone on reddit told me that was a stupid investment. I am just as confident about $AI today as I was $PLTR a few months ago._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How are you guys gauging value these days? I'll be honest, I'm lost at this point. It seems like things that I thought were overvalued just keep going up and it's gotten to the point where I don't have any sense of whether or not a stock has room to keep going up or not. Most recent example for me was NET. I love the company and really wanted to buy. When it popped to like $77, I felt like it was a bit too expensive to buy and was hoping for a pullback.. welp, it's $84 as of today and seems like it could keep going. Similar stories with a lot of these other tech stocks that have been rolling hard as of late.

Even in other sectors, I feel like nothing is cheap anymore. Industrials and materials have been skyrocketing, almost every IPO shoots to the moon instantly, and "recovery" stocks have been crushing it too even though many have yet to show positive results in the real world.

Are we in a market of "buy high, sell higher"? My fear is that buying anything at these prices does not give much room to weather even a moderate downturn in the market.

These are all charted on a 180D/4H candle chart.

**$DOC**:We have an ascending trendline that it just tapped into. Under is a support area, and we have had consistent higher lows through the last few months. It is below both EMA lines so it needs to break these to have true strength. If it breaks price resistance over $18.00 - this is gonna be a runner!  

**$GOOS**: Great ascension and uptrend over the last 6 months, now making a new channel. IT showed life at our $30.75 support area, and this is above our 70% volume area - which is a great sign of life here. All indicators cannot get lower, so we have plenty of room to run!  

**$HLT**: This stock loves to make a move up to a new channel, establish itself, then do it again. We have a beautiful move up and now a new channel. It showed life before and now has room to run, and even has a chance to make a newer channel over $111. The stochastic cannot get much lower, and MACD is about to cross. It is above all 3 EMA lines as well, beautiful setup.  

**$JCI**: What a beautiful trendline up! We are now at the bottom of the channel up, support, and 50EMA which it respects as well. It has plenty of room to run and if the trend continues, the longer you hold the more you will make until this channel is broken. It is a gorgeous price action setup.  

**$MTNB**: We have a channel up over the last month, and today it lives again. It has a resistance at $1.08 and that is only $.02 away. IF the trend holds and it makes this resistance into a support, you will make plenty of money. It is also being bolstered by the 50EMA right below it, which also gives it steam into this resistance.  

**$PEAK**: 3 month uptrend and the stock is slowly reversing right in this channel. No coincidence it is coupled with a support, and the top of our 70% volume area as well. Stochastic and RSI oversold, so it has plenty of steam up.  

**$PRTA**: 7 month uptrend up channel, and it is above it so we technically have room to drop. But this support right above our Point of Control node is holding so this is also a good area to buy right now. This stock has beautiful channels and the Stochastic cannot get much lower, and is showing a bullish divergence. Watch this one, it is beautiful.  

**$ROK**: Up trending channel again today; and is right in the channel which is beautiful. It is trying to break this resistance at $251; and if it does it is going to make a beautiful move. Indicators show neither good or bad signs, it all comes down to this potential reversal right here.  

**$SILV**: 7 month horizontal channel that is still moving along. It is in the point of control volume area so it is extremely powerful in terms of being a support. If it lives here you can easily see 15% profit at our next resistance. Indicators are also in the middle so not good or bad at this point, both EMA lines are above so keep that in mind.  

**$WDAY**: Gooooooorgeous uptrend up, and it is right above this line. It is coupled with a support and a 200EMA line, and all indicators show bullish days ahead?! Yea.... this is beautiful. 

Happy Trading; Comment for clarity or questions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IPO ? How do IPOs work?  Like today with air bnb, the IPO price was $68 but it had already more than doubled before the open.  So what I’m trying to understand is we’re people able to buy shares of abnb at $68 and if so how?  Or what is the relevance of the $68 number when the price at the open was $146.

Was it all premarket open activity that drove the price from $68 to $146?   And how would someone have gone about buying in at $68?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FDA authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, first approved in the U.S. https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/10/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/

I already have small shares in Tesla, Airbus, MJ, and Amazon._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DoorDash, UberEats... Mafia companies? For me, they really sound like that. They create a business on serving a product/service they don't own. They come to your country/city and slowly start making hard for restaurant owners to operate if they don't join them. Even if a restaurant has its own delivery service, only the hardcore fans will be ordering directly from the company website/app (unless they are big chains like dominos or pizza hut). So slowly the restaurants are forced to join, and lose a good percentage of their hard-earned income to them (I have heard that door dash charges 10 to 25%).

Why restaurants do not rebel??? I mean, it is not really that hard for the restaurants to cooperatively make a service/app like door dash. A dozen or so of good programers can replicate it in few months.  Ok, agree, the whole logistics of the fleet of cars/bikes, drivers, routing, etc can be complicated,.... but still it is not impossible. It can even be a separate company, where a big chunk of the shares are available only to the restaurants, and the restaurants can join the service only by buying shares. I am sure there are tons of other alternatives.

The same goes for Uber and Airbnb. They advertise themselves as the leaders in sharing economy. But  a true sharing economy is where the owners are the ones who are providing the service/product. Is it too naive to imagine an Uber like service/app that is owned by the drivers collectively, or airbnb that is owned by the renters, etc? Maybe this is more difficult than the doordahs/ubereats cases as we are dealing mostly with individuals and not businesses. But on the other hand, specially with Airbnb, the logistics are much simpler, no drivers, no route optimisation, etc...

In short, I am dreaming of a time when all these parasite companies disappear. If anyone wants to join forces and start a slow coup d'etat of these companies, let me know :-)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ USA FDA Committee has approved the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer $PFE USA FDA Committee has approved $PFE vaccine.
