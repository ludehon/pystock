 Bearish on Silver. Going hard on SLV puts and ZSL calls I have a very bearish outlook on silver. I've got several puts on SLV, and calls on ZSL, as well as 25% of my portfolio on ZSL. Everytime the price has dropped, I've been buying more. YOLO. 

To those unfamiliar on what ZSL is, it's an ETF short on silver that "provides -2x the daily performance of silver". Basically a 2x Leveraged etf. Btw it's a terrible idea since proshares stocks - by nature - have decay, but fuck it. We're here to YOLO not be smart. Calls/puts are out for January 2022 btw. 

Currently up on the calls / puts, since I bought it when silver was at its lowest point recently (like $6.30 on ZSL). My average price on ZSL stocks is $8 tho since I bought the first wave when it initially dropped to $9.50, and keep buying more and more at lower costs

Why am I so bearish? Who tf knows. Especially with the US dollar going down. But I'm embracing my gut feeling that as the pandemic gets better, and the elections steady out (looking at u 🎺 supporters) silver will crash. Who knows, maybe the millionaires will see the crash on Friday and it'll rollercoaster outta control

AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print

Positions: AAPL 132c 2/5

https://preview.redd.it/2pzvjv51gca61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3ec55f5d2209e731ffad991bf518f2c1e4fcec1

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. 

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

 Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. 

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. 

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

https://preview.redd.it/quqwmg5mmda61.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3607de4af73989b6e35274c26bf82fd1a68dad

 Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. 

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

 I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. 

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9.

# 

Let me explain why:  


**1. Twitter has just provoked the eyes of Congress in an unspeakably stupid way**  
Twitter has for years attempted to fend off Congress by claiming that they're fundamentally neutral, and their Terms of Service don't have real ramifications to speech. By suspending hundreds of prominent conservatives, including POTUS, they've now declared a partisan war which, I can guarantee you, House Democrats are going to be asking "why didn't you do this before?". I think the Republican talking points are going to be obvious, but if there was ever a reason to repeal Section 230, this is it.  


**2. Twitter's fundamentals suck, and everyone knows it**  
The straight fundamentals of Twitter are terrible. They've got a stagnated user base, and by kicking off Trump, they've provoked an exodus which will almost definitely show up in their Feb 9th earnings. At the moment, puts are cheap, as they've been on a bit of a tear upwards. . . but I don't see this continuing. They could lose a lot of revenue from their recent actions, but I don't see anyone hopping ***onto Twitter because they did what they did. This is a net-loss action.***   


**3. Puts are cheap**   


If there was ever a good reason to go against Twitter, it's that puts are super cheap at the moment. No one could have foreseen that the Trump rally would go this way. I work at one of the social media companies (not Twitter), and trust me, it caught everyone off-guard. This decision has fundamentally reshaped the investment thesis around social media; non-US dominated versus US dominated / regulatory and anti-trust risk, etc etc etc. Puts are cheap as fuck. I recently paid for some puts (5 contracts of TWTR $48.50 Put 1/15 +  10 contracts of TWTR $40.00 Put 2/26), and it's discounted for sure.  


**4. In summary:**  
Ya'll are smart enough to see that this recent action is bullshit. I'm willing to say that this is actually the beginning of the end for Twitter. $FB will last longer because of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Reddit has a decent trajectory, but monetization is a bit of an issue. Pinterest is actually the biggest dark-horse of the bunch, though I'm personally bullish on Indian stocks atm.

This is interesting because ES has always driven orderflow to the market. Volume and price action on ES matches TSLA on Friday. Financials and energy were down. Big tech was flat yet S&P 500 was up on the day largely due to TSLA. When factoring in volatility, TSLA now has more control of SPY than AAPL. Your 401Ks are now in the hands of Papa Elon.

We are the captain now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Interesting article about Enron from 2001 Here is an old article about Enron: https://money.cnn.com/2006/01/13/news/companies/enronoriginal_fortune/

The more things change, the more they stay the same :)

Some choice quotes:

> Not surprisingly, the critics are gushing. "Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary franchises in several business units in very large markets," says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

> This business, which Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like the "financialization of energy"--but also, more simply, as "buying and selling gas and electricity." In fact, Enron's view is that it can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity. 

> But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a "logistics company" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to its destination.

>  Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities, from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space. Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

> In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. "Enron is no black box," says Goldman's Fleischer. "That's like calling Michael Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to score every quarter."

From an analyst report from the same period:

> “We strongly believe that Enron can be characterized as being ‘at the forefront of the energy marketing and communications revolution’ because it appears that the technologies and services that the company is using and developing will literally change the way people live and businesses operate throughout the world”

> “All told, with consistent earnings and cash flow from the Transportation business, market dominance in the wholesale and retail sectors, and projected hypergrowth in its broadband business, Enron’s long-term vision is to possess unbeatable scale and scope in every business and region in which it operates,”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Warming up the PLinTeR for next week _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anything TSLA ,QQQJ,YOLO,ICLN related . buy How retarded do we really have to be

AMD 100c 1/29_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SPY speculation for short term 2021 Sitting on the sidelines making modest gains while I watch you retards yolo tesla FDs and make annual salaries on a weekly basis. Tired of not participating so I'm trying to find a good play.

SPY is sitting at ATH of $381, an increase of  67% + from the bottom of market crash

 13% + from previous ATH before crash                

 The previous 4 months saw an increase of 10.43% from October to January   

Continuing on this path from January to April, a 4 month drawn out 10% increase would land SPY at a price point of:  $ 419.10                      

 Target Price  $ 419.10        

 Breakeven  $ 405.61         

Current $381.00     

%+ to B/E: 6%                 

We only need to see a 6% increase  over 4 months to reach breakeven point. While under normal circumstances,   6% over 4 months is a gamble, here is my autistic DD.

Fed anounced $2k stim which is going to boost the markets overall when it hits peoples accounts. You can say it's priced in, but nothing is priced in in this market until it actually happens.  Fed printed 4 trillion dollars in  2020 with more to come in 2021. Inflation is also contributing to the increase in the bull market.

IMO the only way market tanks is if interest rates increase, which won't happen until at least 2022.              Biden has anounced a multi-trillion dollar stimulus to be rolled out VERY soon. Billions allocated to improving vaccine distribution, billions for small businesses, $2k stimulus for citizens, extended unemployment benefits, basically, trillions of dollars will be flooding into the economy to stimulate the fuck out of it. Fed are determined to keep everything afloat at whatever the cost.

&#x200B;

The question isn't "will spy hit 400$?", the question is will SPY hit $400 by April? With all these catalysts I think theres a damn good chance it will.

Is my train of thought rational? Trying to decide whether or not to yolo x20 04/16 400c.

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021.  It's Total Addressable Market is 300B \[2\]\[5\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries.  It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen.  ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\]\[6\].  This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now.  The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery.  What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery;  or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings.  Picture  the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge.  Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note:  blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel.  green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\].  Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells).  They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\].  So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035.  Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.  And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

In simple terms, CRM software helps businesses track customer information, log service issues, and manage their marketing campaigns.

I suspect the phase 2b will telegraph phase 3 so I won’t be surprised if the stock runs up. We will probably test the 109-110 region again before beginning run up around Jan 15+. 

Stock seems to be pretty volatile as retail shuffles in and out.  

TLDR. All the models were wrong, NVAX crowd too early. Results most likely end of January and not sooner. 2/19 130c monthlies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will these print?? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Xiaomi $XIACF the next stock to blow up Hear me out. 

Xiaomi Ticker $XIACF is probably one of the most undervalued companies at the moment and here is why:

Despite its weak branding in the Western hemisphere, Xiaomi is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Standing at rank four, Xiaomi competes against electronic manufacturing giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Affordable pricing

Xiaomi offers smartphones and other electronic devices at extremely competitive prices. This is extremely important for two reasons. First off, Xiaomi’s budget-friendly pricing allows them to compete for the more budget-friendly consumers in developed regions. Secondly, it allows them to enter new, previously-untapped markets in which smartphones were previously too expensive. For example, Xiaomi is able to sell millions of devices in the Asian market, especially in China and India, which would be impossible as a luxury brand such as Apple or Samsung.

Substantial profit margins

Most amazing of all, Xiaomi is able to offer quality products at affordable prices, and still make plenty of profit for themselves. Quite consistently, Xiaomi has posted profits amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Xiaomi can thank low manufacturing costs for their high-profit margins. These low manufacturing costs are likely due to the low cost of labor in China, as well as the significant economy of scale which arises when manufacturing so many devices.

TLDR; undervalued stock with high potential waiting to blow up.

Why I'm shorting TWTR TLDR: bad fundamentals, bubble burst insurance, political landscape

&#x200B;

There are 3 reasons why I'm going to buy put leaps on twitter this coming Monday. I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

Twitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.

&#x200B;

**Bubble insurance**

Whether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk. 

But if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.

&#x200B;

**Political headwinds**

I don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place. 

Now, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.

I haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.

&#x200B;

Conclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock.

Huge thanks to Papa Elon and Papa Jpow. Say with me, 'to the uranus' (this is the way) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nvidia and the ARM deal So I’m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I’m not sure myself, first time posting here.

I know this stock hasn’t been talked about for some time here, but I’d like to know your opinions.

Atm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI’m stupid, I’m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.

At the moment it’s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. 

And as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can’t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.

For those who don’t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: “a reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design” acoording to Wikipedia, so they’re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. 

What people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU’s.


Given the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.

I’ve seen people here saying it’s the CCP being butthurt, but I’ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn’t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits already fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. 

I’d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP’s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I’d love to hear your arguments against and for.

Bull case: I’d say they’re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.

Bear case: When looking at the P/E it’s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I’ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don’t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.

I hope you’ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.

200 shares and 4/16 19c GME_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ben is a 🌈🐻 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Next Nike/Adidas This is my first post in this godforsaken echo chamber of NIO, PLTR, TSLA, VALE, and GME. I’m tired of hearing mostly the same shit, as I’m sure most of you 🌈 🐻’s are too. I’m presenting a completely different, yet solid stock with loads of potential.

Do you remember when Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) were both sitting around $20/share around 2010-11? Well, Hanes Brands (HBI) is sitting nicely (as of writing) at $15.36. The company has solid revenue of $7B (2019) and most importantly, they have a winner of a brand in Champion clothing. 

When was the last time you saw anyone ever wear this historically shit and uncomfortable Walmart brand clothing? For me, it’s been over the past month. I’m a gym rat and I’ve been seeing shoes, workout shirts, and sweaters all touting the Champion crescent. I never saw this shit in the past 10 years of going to the gym. 

It definitely seems like Champion is evolving into a higher-end sports clothing brand. Because of this I can’t find the shit in Walmart anymore, I picked up a workout shirt from them a couple of weeks ago, and it is COMFORTABLE. Sure, it’s not Lulu Lemon (LULU) type bougie suburban athletic wear, but I see Champion clothing everywhere I go now. Doesn’t matter if it’s at Chipotle or on Instagram vanity pictures, Champion is slowly pushing into the reputable athletic clothing market as we speak. 

Hanes Brands is solid, and has a good reputation. There is almost no reason why this stock wouldn’t go up in the near future, especially if an extra 2k in stimmy is passed.

TLDR: Hanes Brands Inc. (HBI) is a solid company and has the prospects of potentially becoming a Nike or Adidas with their brand of clothing, Champion. Buy now while it’s around $15/share.

Positions: 25 shares @ 14.11 (buying more after this weekend)

EDIT: after researching a little bit, [HBI could be due for a squeeze before its Q4 earnings report on 2/4](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-hanesbrands-061851494.html) 🚀 🚀 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Took GM 50 years to come up with this? So bad its bullish🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next Stop to Tendie Town, Magna International (MGA). To the Moon and Beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Magna International. (MGA) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

 

Hey retards, I am bringing you here the latest rocket that’s going to go to the moon and give us infinite tendies. Magna international (MGA). I put 7 rockets in the title because you can multiple your money by 7 (source: my DD and my dreams) 

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Body Exteriors & Structures, Power & Vision, Seating Systems, and Complete Vehicles. 

Notable Clients: Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo…
As you can see every big company is their client

An example of a complete vehicle made is the Jaguar I-Pace. This is one of the keys. We have got a lot of IPO money going into EV’s companies that don’t have any manufacture capability. Here is when Magna is gonna enter the scene and go to the moon and beyond 

They are present in 27 countries,+165.000 employees, 13.000 engineers and nearly 40B in sales. 

Revenue is growing in the last 10 years, went from  28B to 40B 

EBITDA is growing too, 2B to 4B 

EV/Ebitda is 12x 

Debt/Ebitda is less than 2x 

CFO went from 1,2B to 3,9B in the past 10 years. 

Steady Capex 

Shares Outstanding, good job with buybacks, went from 471M to 306M 

Free cash flow per share went form 0,15$ to almost 8$  

The average free cash flow yield the last tean years is nearly 10% 
 

They just signed an agreement last month with LG that made the stock rise 10% 

And the most important thing, they’re the frontrunners to build the Apple EV car. If/When this happens and is official ... Can you imagine the jump we'll see?? 

As they say, buy with the rumors and sell with the news. But even without this, Magna is the frontrunner to be one of the most important companies of the next 10 years, since the car companies want to externalize as much as possible to continue competing. 

When Apple and other EV companies begin to announce big big deals with MGA, it would be too late. 

Position: 104 boomer shares at 45$ but planning to YOLO my life savings as soon as possible.

TL;DR: Great fundamentals, good growth, great management, potential EV super winner (AppleEV). MGA to the moon
Forecast: 100$ EOY + 30% upside the day Apple announces the deal.

* ^(One of those, the Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project in Nevada,) **is expected to be approved on Jan. 15, according to an official at the Bureau of Land Management.**
* “**It’s been a good, collaborative process with state and federal authorities. We look forward to the decision**,” ^(said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which has been developing the project for more than a decade. Lithium is a key component of electric vehicle batteries.)
* **Administration officials tell Reuters** ^(they plan to publish a raft of decisions on Jan. 15 that will expand miners’ access to federal lands), **give final approval to Lithium Americas Corp’s Nevada lithium mine** ^(and approve a land swap for a Rio Tinto Ltd Arizona copper mining project, among other steps.)

**Notes about the Thacker Pass Project:**

* Located in Nevada
* Nevada has recently run out of unemployment funding due to COVID and has asked for federal loans. Nevada WILL NOT deny lithium-based revenue from companies like $LAC and have already approved tax incentives for them.
* Training of local workers for land development has already begun. Jobs are already created and filled. 
* The Thacker Pass is the largest known Lithium deposit in the US and 2nd largest globally 

This is truly revolutionary in the EV and lithium-based mining. As we all know EV companies have been on an absolute run lately as well as all lithium companies.

Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, "Brrrr".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, "Brrr". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

LOGI lord and savor 149% gain _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An interesting fact about GME and the age of digital gaming (GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀) What’s up GME gang. I know this week has been hard, but I think we all know this will pay off. Hopefully you all took this week as an opportunity to average down, if you got caught buying at $20 a share. Also I got my dad to purchase 1000 shares right before close, and he said I’m getting the belt if this goes tits up. But on to the important part...

Basically I was browsing the internet, bored as shit with the markets being closed, and found this gem of a detail, that I was completely unaware of. I’ve been long GME, mostly because of daddy Cohen, but this is just one more reason why I’m 💎✋🤚s on this beautiful stock. 

This news might be old, but as someone who looks at all the DD, I was surprised to see it. 

To keep it short, (hahaha fuck Melvin) basically GameStop has a partnership with Microsoft, and gets a percentage of digital game sales, and other digital purchases, if the console was purchased at GameStop. That means that all these new consoles that just keep on selling out at GameStop, will keep generating revenue for years to come, even if customers don’t come and buy games. 

Article: https://gamingstreet.com/hold-or-sell-gamestop-the-digital-shift-vs-a-new-microsoft-partnership/

TL;DR GameStop can still capture digital sales through partnerships.

Discovered first by [Electrek](https://electrek.co) Tesla had updated their website to include the Model Y standard range to start at $41,990 as of yesterday (8/01/21). Cheaper price does mean slightly lower range (244 miles (standard range) compared to 326 long-range version) 244 is still a no-brainer for the price, out-driving Audi’s e-tron ($81,000 with 239-mile range), Nissan and BMW’s electric vehicles for literally half the price. 

July last year Musk tweeted that the “standard range” Model Y would not be produced because its range <250 is “unacceptably low”. 
They are now taking orders for the standard range Model Y’s at the cheaper “standard range” price as of this week.

New 7-seat version of Model Y is now on offer according to their updated website.

Yeah I get it, we have had a rough and painful fucking week. Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.

For all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.

As we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a "fun ride." I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.

Massive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to "keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.

Yesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).

For all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.

I know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a "Do Not Enter" sign to prevent future mishaps.

At this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE.

What a week in steel with some **BIG MOVES.**

Then came this morning. . .people panicked and paper hands sold.

As I said this morning, be patient and hold - it had gotten too hot too fast and we were due for a cool off, however I said - **THIS IS YOUR BUYING OPPORTUNITY!**

**BUY THE DIP!**

**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND!**

$CMC was downgraded today to HOLD by Deutsche and then it dumped.

I disagree with their opinion - HIGHLY DISAGREE.

They then upgrade $X and it moons.

Upgrades are great, but you have to take downgrades with a grain of salt, especially by a bank that is upgrading a competing US steel stock on the same day. . .what are they holding?  What do they want to buy?

It smells a little suspect, but that's why you do your own research.

Anyhow, on to the real news of the day that reversed the market and that was Biden's press conference and he laid out that he would be announcing his economic package next week.

 "Biden is also likely to push for a larger legislative effort later in 2021 after the initial stimulus package. **That effort is expected to focus on spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure** and clean-energy jobs."

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/)

The market instantly reversed and steel started recovering, quickly and by the AH action, I believe we are **PRIMED FOR A BIG WEEK COME MONDAY.**

What really stood out to me today was this as well:

[https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again)

Everyone that has read my posts know **$MT is my favorite play.**

The doubters in the beginning (and still - I do get your DM's - lots of angry people out there!) said this was a pump and dump.

$MT popped and then went sideways for a week or so - I said to wait and be patient.

That patience has started to come to fruition.

These increases are immediate and will be taken and like Oliver Twist - customers will say, "please sir, I want some more"

$MT: "More?!?!?"

$MT: No problem, it's another $50/ton"

Customer: "Please sir, I want some more"

$MT: "More?!?!"

$MT: Sure another $100/ton and it will ship in June, oh and by the way, you'll have to pay extra by then because your price is now the price we agreed upon and adders, so PRICE TIME OF SHIPMENT.

By the way, that is becoming common-place in the steel industry today.

As promised earlier today, here is a Force Majeure letter from Deacero, one of the largest steel makers in Mexico:

NOTICE HOW THE PRICE INCREASES ARE **RETROACTIVE??!!**

This is becoming common-place and this is how steelmakers ENSURE their margins in markets where raw materials are running faster than they can buy them.

This is part of my thesis as to why these companies are going to show INCREASED REVENUE and most importantly - **INCREASED PROFITS.**

Also, those that believe in what's coming and understand the value and dynamics in the market made some shrewd moves and **BOUGHT THE DIP!**

Go to the 'More' tab on the bottom far right, then go to 'Contact us'.

From there hit the message bubble next to 'Need help with your account?'. That will open an iMessage window.

Once there, type in "Fund account". It will ask you to click a link to login to TDA on Safari then you can come back to the iMessage and it will ask you to click on a 'Deposit Menu'. 

Click on the 'Deposit Menu' and select the first option which is Apple Pay (Debit Card Deposit) and from there you're good to go! Just keep following the instructions.

TL;DR: TD Ameritrade also offers Instant Deposit for iOS but if you're on Android...R.I.P. I guess. Also, puts on RH!! "

He wants capital to (1) save Earth and (2) colonize Mars.

Nearly all of his net worth is currently tied to the share price of $TSLA, so how does he extract cash without selling shares and pushing his net worth down?  I know, I know, what a lovely problem to have!

But seriously, how can he maintain his net worth while extracting cash?

Someone recently suggested to Musk that he change his corporate structure to resemble Alphabet. Elon replied positively.

The Plan: restructure $TSLA into a holding company which then acquires, one-by-one and only when the timing is perfect, each of his private companies.  Musk receives a direct cash payout for his share of each private company.

Elon gets cash, $TSLA holders gain various private companies. $TSLA’s share price fluctuates, but never crashes and analysts dive in and attempt to quantify the future value of each new company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ready for Blast Off 🚀 #PSTH _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Me and homies every time PSTH jumps 5% _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pot Bubble 2.0 Coming tl;dr - Pot will be legalized for recreational use, with federal prohibition entirely removed, within the year. Many states are already legal, many more have announced full legalization plans. Local governments around the country are in dire financial straits and this both saves money and generates additional tax revenue. Business goes from "gray area" to approved, entering the era of big business and finance getting more involved.  

^(I haven't had the time to research the best valued companies yet so my money is just on MJ calls, $16-20, 2-12 months out, and other ETFs for now...)

It's been surprising to see the weak price action on pot stocks this week after Democrats took both GA seats, not because of any hope but because it's already been solidified that weed will be nationally legal for recreational use this time next year. It looks like a piece of legislation passed on December 4th went under the markets radar.  

The Democratic controlled house has *already* [passed the "MORE" act](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-12-04/house-approves-federal-marijuana-decriminalization-in-historic-vote) which removes federal prohibition on Marijuana and leaves it to the states. This is significant for many obvious reasons, most important of which is turning a "gray" business for (multi-)national companies (e.g financial institutions) into an approved one, which will add fuel to the sectors growth.  

Biden has *already* been certified as the next president of the United States. Both GA runoffs have *already* resulted in Democratic control of the Senate. There is almost no scenario in which weed isn't legalized within the year on a federal level. As I'm sure many of you know, states around the country not only spend huge amounts of money through courts prosecuting these cases, but are also in dire financial straits due to the pandemic. 

Now what can both save money while generating additional tax revenue? Legalization. With federal prohibition removed, many states already allowing recreational use, and many more with plans to, the dominos will start falling. Why would NC give up all this tax revenue to CO, much less when they have multiple connected states with the same options also competing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Barron’s: “GameStop Stock Has Soared Despite Falling Sales. Reality Could Eventually Catch Up” _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Show me on the doll where the TA touched you inappropriately. How many of you retards got burned joining a pump n dump TA group or from taking trades based off someone else’s chart? It’s the only explanation I can think to explain why so many of you feel the need to waste your life repeating the same tired shit everyday I post a chart. I get that you think that TA is like talking to tree spirits, casting dried up chicken dicks into a scrying bowl, or interpreting the patterns that form from the drool as it drips from my goddamn lips. This page is literally for dopamine infused gambling addicts who yolo their accounts using questionable information from random strangers on the internet. How in the everliving fuck is a chart with crayon lines on it even remotely worse than that? next time you feel the need to comment, say something witty and make it worth my time. At least TRY to cover up the uselessness you feel about your own lives. That shit is radiating from you like the heat from 1,000 suns._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think he’s starting to crack. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We've all been there... amiright? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TRIGGER WARNING: Time to sell your TSLA you autists Hello people here is some DD for you,

I don't own TSLA and I don't short TSLA, but I am giving you bagholders some damn good advice. The years of 600% gains are over. With TSLA sitting at a 800 billion dollar market cap, you would need it to hit a 1.6 billion market cap to make 100%. That's not only retarded, I guarantee my magic 8-ball says there will be a correction before that ever happens. 

So some good advice to you all, sell your TSLA and go pump and shill some other stocks with your tendie tarding power.

Signing off,
