 Thursday EOD GME Gamma and OI Update **TLDR: GME gamma remains elevated. Estimates: $10 price increase forces about 12m shares bought by dealers; $10 price decrease forces 23m shares sold by dealers. Not necessarily bullish or bearish. Expect vol around 39/40 price range. Slight expirations tomorrow that will pressure the stock down about 1-2%, so buying or selling pressure can send it up or down, it's just 'naturally' going down 1-2% with no net buy or sell.**

I'm attempting to provide this with no bullish or bearish read. As last week, I'm bearish and have a slight put position, which has been a real loser this week, go bulls, and most of all go thetagang.

But this analysis is intended to be neutral, and I leave it to you to interpret, and there are legitimate bullish or bearish reads out of the raw data here.

Like prior posts, GME has so many options on it that the behaviors of option dealers/ market makers are significant if price moves by creating clusters of short gamma on their books.

This assumes that dealers are pretty short options (meaning, they sold them to you guys).

When there are a lot of short options at a strike, much like a bunch of matter in one place creates a gravity well that makes things move faster through it, a concentration of you degenerates has similar impact on stock price movements. The quanta of those field interactions is the Degeneron, which will hopefully be on investopedia soon. If you get too much in one place, it creates a singularity (degenerity) in which price and volume are swapped, red becomes green and green becomes red, and a new wormhole is created into a new universe in which celery sticks replace tendies, and r/investing advocates YOLO investing because it's suddenly wholesome and responsible.

Explained more directly, huge gamma concentrations create a price movement acceleration because dealers have to sell stock when price falls, and buy stock as price rises, to be fully hedged on their short options and not lose money. And they almost never lose money.

Here's the current state of things:

[https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv](https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv)

Right now, if we were to go up $10 from here, dealers would also have to buy about 12 million GME shares, assuming about 80% of all options are net short on the dealer, which should be about right with how much speculation is going on.

Using similar assumptions, if we were to go down  $10 from here, dealers would need to sell about 23 million shares. If you want to equalize on % terms, I guess trim that down to 18 or 19, but those are equal money amounts naively.

This is kind of asymmetric and oversells the down ramp though because most of the gamma ramp is very near at 39/40, which means you can expect a rapid price movement down if it gets near 41 with momentum, but would slow down somewhat after passing 38.5 or so.

This is because gamma ramp remains largest at 39/40. It is also significant at 45. There's a more equally distributed ramp in the territory under 40. But most of the ramp is that 40/39 that we passed over today, and that drove a lot of the price action today.

There are gammas at 60 and 30, and they are significant (would describe as medium), but they are far away.

Remember, gamma only matters if the buying or selling gets you near the price range. And gamma ramps only matter if large. On virtually all stocks, it is not large. It is large on GME, and sometimes other WSB stocks, particularly smaller cap ones.

In terms of open interest expiring this week (also in that link), it's a lot less than last week, about 3.1m shares of exposure of in the money calls. Compared to last weeks 10% down movement, you'd expect only a few % of pressure from this tomorrow, and that starts to fade if price goes down, so I would SWAG it at 1-2% of downwards pressure from option rolls/sells that are obligatory on friday._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market-driving news (Jan 21, 2021 GME euphoria edition) * The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's nonstop buying - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

Consider ELY and pre-purchase your ticket to this LONG DRIVE ROCKET 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A detailed breakdown of the GME Shitron video with answers. Edit: link to video...https://youtu.be/mEi2axM4hwI

SOME of what he said was technically accurate...but those things can be countered with little effort.

1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!

Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.

2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.

Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.

Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.

3. Valuation matters.  

Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.

4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.

Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to "short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story." not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.

5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.

You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

In Lemon mans latest rant ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&feature=youtu.be&ab\_channel=CitronResearch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=CitronResearch)) , he says, the only way to "save gamestop is actually buying something from them". So I do my research. Mods I am not breaking any rules saying this, do your own research before investing anything.

My idea is all in the PowerupPro subscription. [https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone)

Powerup pro is gamestops subscription service. For 15$ a Year you get 5$ upfront and 5$ every month for the year. In total this is 65 USD. This is free money, and way less volatile than actual stocks. What you can do with this is wait 1 year, buy a highly sought-after release (ie COD, some game that has market scarcity) from games stop at the midnight release, buy it for 65$ or whatever price it is (even though you yourself have only paid 15$, and you can then either play this new expensive game at a massive discount or, you can go on ebay and make a 300% profit on your investment, all while helping gamestop (only saying this because gamestop is part of my childhood and minor business does not = fluctuations on the open market).

Also for 5$ extra you can get yourself a copy of [Gameinformer.com](https://Gameinformer.com), which is a fucking steal for something to have on your coffee table.

I'd like your input, and again do your own due diligence. This is an investing forum, and this is a great small game which honestly has alot less risk than other stocks priced similarly. Let me know what you think_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I AINT SELLING NEITHER SHOULD YOU. Hold GME💎👐🚀. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICLN options are very cheap and have solid Greeks right now - excellent LEAP opportunity right now Biden is about to inject trillions of dollars over 2021 into climate change and ICLN is going to benefit greatly from this. I’ve been tracking the IV for ICLN January 2022 leaps and they are now at a level that GREATLY favors the buyer.

IV around 63% for $45 Jan 2022 calls with a -0.011 theta and a $42.60 delta. This setup of Greeks favors the option investor and given that Biden is now president, and plans to combat climate change through a $2 trillion dollar plan that focuses on limiting fossil fuels and expanding use of clean energy solutions aka ICLN.

TAN does not have as favorable Greeks as ICLN and carries more risk for less gain currently compared to ICLN. Biden just took office yesterday and is filling his cabinet, but in the coming weeks along with his pandemic and racial inequity solution, this climate change push will be initiated giving institutions reason to invest. So I implore you to think about buying ICLN or other clean energy leaps for 2021.

Positions: $45 1/22/22 ICLN calls

Edit: Biden has already begun signing executive orders to combat climate change through clean energy via joining the Paris Climate Agreement AND has limited progress on the Keystone XL Pipeline greatly, which has forced the Keystone Pipeline jobs to be slashed by 1000 so far.

**Inaugural Demo Day on January 26, 2021** :

Demo Day marks the first time Palantir is demoing the latest developments to its software platforms, Foundry and Gotham, to the general public. The demos will include              examples of how Palantir’s commercial and government customers —  including manufacturers, defense agencies, and others — use its software.

The event will also highlight Palantir’s modular strategy,  including the announcement and demonstration of new software modules such as:

&#x200B;

* **Software-Defined Data Integration (“SDDI”):** to integrate with dozens of ERP systems in days
* **Low-Code / No-Code Environments:** to deploy operational applications in hours
* **Archetypes:** to start business use cases in a few clicks
* **AI-Enabled Mission Command:** to support U.S. and allied nations in planning and executing missions

Palantir will also discuss its latest developments on Apollo, the company’s continuous delivery and infrastructure platform. Apollo ensures Foundry and Gotham can be used by customers in any environment. In Q4 2020, Apollo managed 150,000+ upgrades per week across environments, up from 40,000+ upgrades per week in Q2 2020.

1. GME is volatile af, because there are actually thousands of people just as dumb as 💩🍋Andrew Left, or they're trapped in their shorts and need GME to go down.


2. Volatility means options are outrageously expensive. You pay out the ass for the time that the option is good for. Don't do that, bad, bad!


2. If we just hold and ride-or-buy any dips, we're going to the 🌚🚀🚀


3. Read this part really slowly: you. can. sell. options. That means you sell time and make 💲💲 every second that nothing happens.


4. You can sell calls or puts. Selling calls is bad because (a) you either own the stock and miss the 🚀(because the shares will get "called away" by whoever brought the calls from you, or (b) you don't own the stock have to buy it at the moon price to hand over the shares to the call buyer. 


5. Selling puts is good because (a) if GME stays high, you get all the juicy premium, which you can use to buy more shares, or (b) if it goes down and you get assigned, you are getting a better price because the price you pay is the "strike" MINUS THE PREMIUM.


EXAMPLE: today I "sold to open" some puts with a strike of 40, getting about $200 for each contract. I needed 3,800 in my account to "secure" each contract (100 shares at the strike - minus the premium). What it amounts to is a 5% gain in 24 hours. Worst case scenario is I am assigned shares at a "cost basis" of $38, which is just dandy to me.

So go forth and pillage more sweet tendies from the bastard 🩳🩳🩳🩳. Buy shares, SELL puts. This is our time and no one is going to take it from us!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit:
Good positions:

40 strike, 1/22 (tomorrow), $70 right now (this is what I'm holding)


42 strike, 1/22, $140 premium right now


40 strike, 1/29, $340 premium (8.5% gain in like a week)

So, I'm a grown ass man looking into GameStop Powerup Rewards, and I can't get into the site.

Is the site down? Anyone know why? The reason I think it's ok to post this here, is because I think the site might be so flooded with traffic that it can't be accessed, which seems like pretty solid DD for their earnings coming up.

But I'm not sure if that's what's going on. Do we have any way of finding out? What is going on with the [GameStop Powerup Rewards site](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/)? Did it break? Why?

Also, on a similar note, for any other dinosaurs like myself, if you haven't given PC or Console gaming a whirl, I would highly recommend it. If you're thinking about investing in GameStop, I actually genuinely recommend going out and buying yourself a console like an XBox, or getting a game that's already out for your PC, and look into what games have evolved into over the years.  Or at very least watch some playthrough of different games on youtube or something.

Some of these games are genuinely awe inspiring, and there's definitely a future in this industry.

What do you all think of MNSO? I believe they had their IPO at the end of October. It didn’t seem to get much attention like so many other recent IPO’s. Below you will find their company profile according to Fidelity. They are essentially like  Japanese design (style), Chinese manufactured, dollar store. If you have ever been to one, they are much nicer than traditional dollar stores, at least in the US. They are growing fast all over the world, and also have an online presence. They are a franchise model and currently looking for master franchises in various parts of the world.  I think they will do well but I don't know squat. I think if there is a recession, they could be well-positioned since they have such low price points. 

According to Fidelity, their PE is higher than the industry average (83 vs 70). 9.78b market cap

From Fidelity “MINISO Group Holding Limited, an investment holding company, engages in the retail and wholesale of lifestyle products in China, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. The company offers products in various categories, including home decor products, small electronics, textiles, accessories, beauty tools, toys, cosmetics, personal care products, snacks, fragrances and perfumes, and stationeries and gifts under the MINISO and WonderLife brand names. As of June 30, 2020, it operated a network of approximately 4,200 MINISO stores, as well as online sales channels. The company was founded in 2013 and is based in Guangzhou, China.”

1. People believe we're in a short squeeze.  TL;DR People that are short have no problem selling more at a higher price
2. The numbers are bad.  Gamestop's retail hardware sales are down even as hardware sales tripled.
3. Valuation

* Hedgeye rec at 14$ at at time when exp EBITDA 330M, not 71M.  If they actually hit 330M (which he feels is impossible), price target would be 26$
* Trades at 40x forward 12M EV - EBITDA.  Apple trades at 23.  Bestbuy 7, Wallmart 13.  Too expensive

4. The funds that are shorting are smarter than you and have big names

5. Company can become your biggest enemy by selling additional stock if the stock is high.

I love this community. Your self-aware "retarded" humor is very powerful and I see a future where people with such a personality will be important.

&nbsp;

**It's about control.** It's not about the money, as some of you have pointed out (jokingly, but jokes are always funny because they’re true), but it’s about control, specifically, individual control. Power to the little man.

&nbsp;

For centuries, if not millenia, the individual person was deemed useless and holding no power over the world. But this control is finally in your (diamond) hands. The diamond vs paper hands meme may look random, because "diamond hard" and "paper soft", no further meaning into it, but when you deal with memes, especially ones that work so well, things are rarely random and have an underlying symbollic meaning. 


Let's look deeper, through an alchemical perspective, let's compare the structure of the diamond and paper: 

 - Paper is made of numerous individual microscopic fibers, all tangeld chaoticly together to create a piece of paper. Obviously, one fiber is useless on its own, but "together they strong". That story, of the power of the collective, has been told for centuries (and still continues to this day). And thus all the power and influence was directed and “put in the (paper) hands” of government or deities (through law and religious texts, written on “paper”). 

 - But we're seeing something happen, a shift. Paper (and thus the power of the collective) is weak. Paper hands are weak. While the diamond, which is basically one big individual molecule (and in that way symbolising the individual being) is strong. Diamond hands are strong. Hands themselves symbolise control, since that's how we interact with the world and make changes- through our hands. We're putting power in the hands of the individual (diamond hands), while we deem the age-old story of the power of the big collective weak (paper hands).

&nbsp;

And what do "diamond hands" do? They HOLD. They hold this idea to be true. They hold to make it true. They hold the power and do not let go of it, are not influenced by the price of the stock (in other words, not influenced by other people). They can not be touched by anything from the outside world and stay whole as an individual, and merely by believing that they are the ones in control, that "stonks only go up", they do.


This is why the meme "wsb is atrology for men" works, or why you are so retarded and autistic, because that's what you are. We have no other word for it. Believing that a stock will go up, because of memes or random signs from the universe, or just because you believe that it will go up is retarded in our society, only retards do that. But that's because the way you are processing the world is a new way of thinking, one that has yet go mainstream and to conquer the world. That's why you take retard and autist as a compliment. Because only an autist thinks that the little man holds any power, but you believe that will all your heart and want it to be true with all of your being.

&nbsp;

Each one of us here is that little man and not only the whole sub, but the whole world is waiting to see the result of this experiment, which will prove once and for all if the little man, the individual HOLDS any power. And I think you already know the result of that experiment. You know the result, because... you, individually, are, indeed, in control of the world and exert as much influence as any "politician", "deity", "collective", "CEO", "Melvin", "Gay Bears" or whatever else people like to give up their personal power to by merely thinking that these people are in control and HOLD all the power. They're not. You are the one HOLDING it. And you are going to prove that to yourself and to everyone who doubts that with GME.

&nbsp;

The main thesis of his position was based primarily off the fact that they're a retailer.

This idiot is thinking so far ahead that hes left his logical thinking behind. GME is currently entering a retrenchment and possibly a divestiture. This does not mean it will fail. It means they are readjusting their priorities and shifting their business model. 

Do not be scared. Do not buy into this bullshit. Name recognition and branding are incredibly important in this world. Gamestop has real options and opportunities - Gaming is still in its infancy. There are a plethora of future positions GME will capitalize on. 

This /IS NOT/ Blockbuster. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr - buy the dips - what this video did was show how little these people know about gaming. It shows how little imagination they have. It shows how little forward thinking is placed into their thought process. Most importantly - it shows how incompetent money managers can be.

So here’s a guide to holding your bag:

TLDR: Shitron, Melvin, and the Big Shorters (BS) are pushing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to keep the price of GME low and substitute boomer risk in place of their own money. The path forward is hold, buy, and push back against FUD for tendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 1150 GME shares @ 38.16 avg

We’ve all seen the mountain of hit pieces in the previous days – Shitron being the worst offender. These pieces serve 3 purposes:

1) they induce fear in the paper hands 📝🙌 among us – “maybe this really is the peak, nobody went broke with 30% gains”. This lets the BS off of the hook for far too low of a price.


2) making boomers the bagholders. i.e. If a correction down is certain, only an idiot would throw away money by NOT shorting the stock 🌈🐻. This creates a synthetic share that they can use to escape their position at current prices.
If the past few years have taught us anything it is that if an untrue position is said loud enough and often enough a huge portion of the viewers will come to believe that statement. 


3) Building the narrative that they are the victims here. 
This is longer term than even the result of what happens financially with GME. There will be a well-funded effort to paint the picture that the entire market was exploited by a group of organized retail investors who found a money hack. This downplays that GME IS a value trade and we are all disparate traders who saw it for what it is worth and might become.
This is important because this narrative gives them a lever to lobby for regulation changes in their favor and avoid client accountability (“We didn’t make a bad trade, we were robbed by those tendie-loving morons at WSB!”.)


The BS must exit the position as soon as possible without blowing up the stock price. Every day that the long dong bulls💎🙌🐂 hold and buy costs them millions of dollars in interest on shares. If boomer retail investors become aware of how good of a deal GME shares are (go read someone else’s DD) and go long🚀🚀🚀 rather than short the price will moon🌑, interest will increase, they will be forced to cover at insane prices, and there will be nobody in the way of massive losses. The only way out for melvin and the BS is to manipulate the market in such a way as to escape consequences for putting themselves in a dangerous position.

Last call SPCE Don’t make me say I told you so...again. Last call SPCE

I’m tired of saying I told you so in the comments sections. Read this DD to get rich

Listen up autists. I know a war is going on but you would be stupid to not yeet some money at this. I know, we have talked about it before but things are really starting to cook this time. There arent enough rocket emojis to explain what is about to happen so Ill give an obligatory 10.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The moment is finally upon us for SPCE to start making serious moves and this is pre-revenue, pre-flight, and pre-publicity. So what is all the hype, why are people confident in its future, and why are they right? One this is for certain this is NOT, I repeat NOT, just a space tourism company.

Let me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:

🚀Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
🚀CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
🚀 (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
🚀CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

Noteworthy Investors:  
🚀Vanguard  
🚀Bank of America  
🚀Morgan Stanley  
🚀ARKQ and now ARKX  
🚀Boeing  
🚀Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
🚀Cathie Wood

Partners:  
🚀Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
🚀Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
🚀NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
🚀Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
🚀Under Armour (suits)

Timeline of events:

1. 🚀Q4 2020🚀: The FAA test flight occurred but it "failed" according to stupid people. Smart people know it was a successful test of the machines fail-safe technology. It was due to a software issue that didn't allow the rocket to ignite. This is a success to smart people because the biggest concern before was "wHaT iF iT bLoWs uP!?" but now that the fail safes have been successfully tested, that is no longer a concern. The software issue has been identified and TODAY they are launched Eve (the mothership for gliding tests, this is an indicator that they will be announcing a new test flight window in the next week or so)
2. 🚀Q1 2021🚀: Sir Richard Branson has been on several media outlets quoted saying that he himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations in the next 2-3 months. This is the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Russell Brand, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.
3. 🚀2021🚀: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.
4. 🚀Around 2025🚀: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.
5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.

Revenue Streams (amount of revenue measured in rockets):

1. Space Tourism🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2. Hypersonic point-to-point travel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
3. Space Force [https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/](https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/)🚀🚀🚀
4. NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Booster Services  🚀🚀

   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.
6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.

Common Objections and Rebuttals:

1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?  

   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the "Johnson's effect" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say "Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.
2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?  

   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it.
3. It's not really "space"  

   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.
4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.  

   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic. When/if SpaceX IPO's I will definitely scoop up some of that, but I won't sell SPCE to do so. 

What I imagine by 2035:

Spaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown "first-class" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.

This is not some flashy new technology, this is the revolution of human travel.  
This is not sci-fi, it is simply sci.  
The future truly is now and we all have an opportunity to be a part of it. Thanks for listening and big disclaimer, I clearly own SPCE shares, because at this point, it doesn't make sense not to.

TLDR: I know you've heard about SPCE before and I know we are at war and I'm holding strong 500 shares GME @ $17, but the rockets are LITERALLY fueling up and you will LITERALLY miss the trip to space if you don't buy before the announcement. Last time it was announced the price was around $23 and ran up to $35, back down to $23 after the "failed" test flight. SPCE is currently sitting at $33. The test flight window will be announce anywhere within the next week or two and will probably run up to 37-40. After it is successful we are looking at 50, after Branson goes up around 70. Once other celebrities start going up and blasting it on their social media we will easily break 100. I don't know how many wins I could post before you retards start listening to me. I took out a 12k loan 4 months ago and now have 96k. The play, I would buy shares. God forbid this test flight has a malfunction as well you dont want them expiring worthless. But hold on til the end of 2021 and youll be loaded. u/DeepFuckingValue yeet a million at this and you'll easily become a $50 millionaire over the next few years. I would if I had more money. 

TLDR2: If my TLDR was too long and you didnt read. Buy fucking SPCE, you're just throwing cash away. Been calling this one since 17_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BIGC buy yesterday paid off! 🚀🚀🚀. Not my biggest win but it feels great when you time something well! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Final $GME position $548,993.95 YOLO - No margin, no leftover cash. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME GANG READ UP! TA analysis to help you to DIAMOND HAND this to infinity and beyond! We're ALMOST there!!! Preface: I've studied TA for 10 minutes on YouTube so obviously I know what I'm talking about. For all you tards who don't even know what support / resistance is, firstly, glad you're still alive, dunno how you've made it this far. Here are the definitions I copy and pasted.

https://preview.redd.it/3dn23so4pqc61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d001aa763ecd12b356ba29d4027793e3717275c

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

A **support level** is a level where the price tends to find support as it falls. This means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_and_resistance#cite_note-DailyFX1-2)

A **resistance level** is the opposite of a support level. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now if you take a look at the price action over the past 2 days, you can see some key supports / resistances.

We seem to have a support at around the $36.76 mark, which means the price will have a tough time falling below this. Translation: Can't go tits up if you bought under $36.

Also, you can see there seems to be a 2nd support growing at the $40 mark. We can make this into a solid support if you PAPER HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS stop selling at $40 and instead RELOAD UP at $40.

Next, we see there is a resistance at about $42.37, and this is where the current battle is being fought right now. Who knows what will happen, if we all do our part, we can win this battle and see the prices stay steady above not only $40, but $42.37

Lastly, there is a "no man's land: at past $44.71. If we manage to break this resistance level, all hell will break loose. The shorts will shit their pants and panic cover their shorts some more. Maybe they'll try and fire off some more bullshit articles too, who knows.

But one thing is for sure, the shorts are slowly running out of oxygen.

TL;DR = BUY THE DIPS at $40 and HOLD.

EDIT: Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀   _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 BIG YOLO on $VST (Vistra Corp), 140 000K USD, ALL LEVERAGED.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 First here's the story,

27 years old retard. Kinda new to this place, started looking into WSB and stocks around July 2020. This is my first big YOLO here. Total portfolio invested 378k. 198k of that amount is leveraged. I found $VST by accident while browsing undervalued stocks on simply wall street and the clean energy thingy caught my eye.

My total stake in $VST amounts to 140 000$ so basically all of it and more is leveraged. Started with 1000 shares at 21,63$ 19 jan. Stock went down today so figured it's time to buy the dip. Got 2000 more shares at 20,99$ today. Figured out this can't go tits up so bought 3500 more shares at 21,289$ today 21/01.

Now here's the DD with 13 reasons why $VST is gonna moon for sure.

1. CLEAN ENERGY: Vistra Corp is a clean energy/electricity producer, makes electricity with solar panels, wind and shit. With the green wave just starting, this is the future of energy.
2. BATTERY/ENERGY STORAGE : Vistra is the BIGGEST player in the game of Lithium-ion battery energy storage. Yes you heard me right, Vistra's facilities are bigger than papa Elon's (Sorry papa, please forgive me for my sins). Vistra is currently building those massive Battery/energy storage facilities in both Texas and California. Papa Elon's energy storage projects in California and Texas are just behind in line as the second biggest in both states. Don't believe me? Just look it up, I'm not making this stuff up.
3. INSIDERS RECENT MASSIVE BUY-IN: Look at those beautiful bars (Image 1 and 2). Insiders have literally only bought shares in the last months at around today's stock price. They know their shit. This is undervalued cause it was discarded by funds as a boring stable non-growth dividend stock, which it is absolutely NOT, and those insiders know it.

4) BIDEN'S CLEAN ENERGY SUBSIDIES/STIMULUS: Biden just cancelled the Keystone XL project. If he doesn't want to encourage oil, where is he planning on getting energy??? Renewable shit like solar is the way to go!! Subsidies and big green energy stimulus coming our way boys!

5) THE EV CRAZE: Those EV companies growing massively are gonna need some fuel guys. Electricity demand is booming. So will Vistra.

6) GROWTH OUT OF US: Vistra make acquisitions in Japan in October. It's expending it's operations in both Japan and Canada. Again this clearly goes to show this is a growth stock valued right now at a boring stable dividend stock price.

7) BIG WELL ESTABLISHED BUSINESS: VST is the largest competitive residential retail electricity provider in the US. With a 10billion market cap, this is the real deal. Not a NKLA bullshit corp. This company is solid and is for sure gonna be the #1 clean energy provider in the near future.

8) SOLID BALANCE SHEET: Look at those beautiful graphs (image 3). Profitable company with rapidly growing earnings and new profit generating battery projects on the way, all of that in a clean energy growing phase of the economy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ph5k4blkpqc61.png?width=1698&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e430c32a2c5ba1e9555c40e8417e701c6fb7710

9) GREAT DEBT RATIO: Debt ratio decreasing every year as the company became profitable! Look at that beautiful Debt to equity graph which says it all (Image 4)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4xf2rovlpqc61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba078d095c5833fec396a726b2366c0b09a375c

10) HIGHLY UNDERVALUED STOCK PRICE: This Corp has a fucking P/E at 11.8x!!!! This is just absolutely insanely stupidly low considering the average US Renewable energy business P/E stands at 53x, and average US market P/E is at 21x. Even the P/B is low at total retard levels at 1,2x. For those who don't know fundamentals, a P/B at 1,2x means that at today's 21,5$ stock price, if the business were to close down everything, sell all it's assets, pay all of it's debts and liabilities and give what's left to shareholders, you'd be getting about as much as what you paid for. This is just plainly stupidly low for not only a growing stock, but an EV and green energy related stock as well.

The good thing about an undervalued stock is that even if you're a scared loser Cramer Boomer who spits on GME and PLTR, there's no way that an investment in Vistra can go sour right now at today's prices since it's undervalued even without considering growth! This is the perfect stock for retards as well as boomers.

11) DIVIDENDS AND SHIT: Dividends are for pussys. But if you want em', Vistra gives em'.

There's proof of my stake in image 5. It's in Beaver dollars but do the math, it all adds up in USD. If this post and $VST gains traction, I swear I'm buying 1000 more of the stock when it goes up to 25$ and I'll even go sell the rest of my portfolio to buy more shares if you retards want me to. As long as I've got money to buy, I'm buying this crap.

EDIT: Added graphs and pics

EDIT 2 for you retards in the comments who want rockets and summary:- TLDR SUMMARY: $VST IS MOONING!!! GET IN THE SHIP YOU FUCKTARDS.

As $BB has already reached my first price target of $12, it has freed up some capital to look for other multi-bagger plays  🚀  🚀 

CALLaway, yes. Why are you preaching some boomer stock? Well, the thing is… it isn’t. $ELY is poised to revamp golf as boomers know it, with their acquisition of Topgolf, not only are they creating new golfers, but they’re also entertaining existing golfers — half the visitors that go to Topgolf venues are already golfers themselves. So, the access and the reach and the added growth and value that will have colossal consumer overlap and consumer growth  🚀  🚀 

Most crucially, half of all visitors identified as non-golfers and the business is growing at an annual rate of 30%

On a conservative end, that’s a price target of $40, even with annual growth rates at 25%, which is on the lower scale of things. Lastly, golf popularity is booming and with Topgolf, it would be a highly scalable play

I get interested on Nokia in 2016 when I listen they will change their business to focus on Networks and equipment, at that time I was only interested on Nokia not because of stocks, because I was working as a telecommunication technician and they have the best network devices and antennas together with Siemens.

So I was pretty happy to see Nokia devices focused on networks, since time passed their products have been popping everywhere because they are pretty robust and nice to use.

I get my second look of attention when I see ALL the UE 5G contacts from Huawei turning into Ericsson and Nokia.

**🔰 I keep digging** into Nokia and I found they are working hard on getting into the India market and relations. Getting known for their value/performance devices.

I took that serious and **I decided to buy one of their new phones,** *just for research.*

It’s the best phone you can buy with that price and Android ONE. And It works pretty smoothly.

☝So what? Why that phones are so important?

**Here is why!** Chinese budget phones are eating the market alive BUT more and more countries and people have been concerned about privacy and security, you see?👀 There is what Nokia is just doing filling the gap budget Chinese companies left behind the opportunity to just REMPLACE the Chinese at EU and US market

So here’s what happened. It’s on the SEDI, not the SEC because Canadian company.

Steve Rai sold off 12,094 indirectly owned shares acquired via an employee stock purchase plan, which means that he chose to take part of his salary as discounted stocks units instead (clear indication he thought they would go up).

He still owns 193,279 performance-restricted share units and 95,024 restricted share units directly. With the **addition in December** of >50,000 shares of restricted share units and >35,000 performance-restricted share units. In other words, he sold off a relatively tiny bit of what was essentially deferred income, and also recently got a performance/continued employment-based deal for a LOT more shares than he sold today. AKA, he's in it for the long haul and believes that shares are a great compensation package.

AND, as of writing this, it’s trading at $4.20 (nice). 

Here are some bullet points cause you autists didn’t read above:

- 5G infrastructure giants.. with little Chinese competition thanks to Daddy Trump (RIP) banning Huawei, Nokia is in an oligopoly when it comes to 5G infrastructure.

- Which means…. they are the world’s 3rd largest telecoms equipment manufacturer

- Nokia does a lot of patent licensing, meaning steady cash flow 

- Beyond telecommunications, they also work in imaging, sensing, Internet of Things, all the buzzwords

- Recently new management

- Government contract are also a sticky biz, and this is the coolest of them all:
    - Motherfuckers signed with NASA a $14M contract to install 4G on the moon. The company is going to the atmosphere, boys 🚀🚀🚀🚀

They just need to cut their costs to become more profitable, which the new management will do, and we’ll be in Valhalla. 🚀

I am hear to present a case for $DBX as I believe there's plays to be made around earnings in February, and I also think 2021 will be a great year for them. I'll keep this somewhat short because, like many of you, I am lazy and hate reading things. First, their Q3 2020 results:

* Total revenue was $487.4 million, an increase of 14% from the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year growth would have been 14%.(1)
* Total ARR ended at $1.981 billion, an increase of $49.8 million quarter-over-quarter and an increase of 12% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year growth would have been 13%.(2)
* Paying users ended at 15.25 million, as compared to 14.00 million for the same period last year. Average revenue per paying user was $128.03, as compared to $123.15 for the same period last year.
* GAAP gross margin was 78.8%, as compared to 75.5% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 80.0%, as compared to 76.7% in the same period last year.
* GAAP operating margin was 6.2%, as compared to (4.3)% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.0%, as compared to 13.1% in the same period last year.
* GAAP net income (loss) was $32.7 million, as compared to ($17.0) million in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income was $110.2 million, as compared to $55.9 million in the same period last year.
* Net cash provided by operating activities was $200.9 million, as compared to $149.7 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow was $187.0 million, as compared to $102.5 million in the same period last year.
* GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.08, as compared to ($0.04) in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.26, as compared to $0.13 in the same period last year.(3)
* Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended at $1.226 billion.

Their Q3 results were strong with a growth in revenue, increase in users, and net income increase. There is also a big increase in free cash flow. Another reason I am looking at them right now is because IV is relatively low (<60%), and with their earnings coming up in February, I think they will continue their earnings surprise streak. I also noticed a huge amount of open interest in call options for April, so I suspect the market feels the same way I do about the stocks movement upwards. Please let me know if I am retarded as this is my first DD. Thanks for coming to my SPED Talk.

Positions: DBX  21-Apr-2021 24C

Option IV is low and there may a good play for their earnings in February, but also long term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Proof 🚀 (hopefully this one works) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Groupthink and Tribalism on WSB Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became "mango bad".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.

On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - <ticker I YOLOed my entire account into>  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.

If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.

I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.

We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Jack Ma Returns He appeared late last night on a speech online to teachers at a charity event.  What do people here think of BABA's chances now?  The stock is down today so is this a buying opp or a stock to avoid?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chinese billionaire Jack Ma,        once the richest man in the country, has resurfaced after being out of        the public eye for months. But his real troubles--and those of his        business empire--may be just beginning.     

Mr. Ma made his first public appearance in nearly three months        on Wednesday, speaking to a group of rural teachers in an online        philanthropic event. Speculation about his whereabouts has been rife        since his last public appearance in October, when he gave a speech that        angered regulators. Since then, the record initial public offerings of        fintech firm Ant Group,        which Mr. Ma controls, were both pulled at the last        minute. China's        antitrust regulator launched a probe into the business practices of        e-commerce giant Alibaba,        another company in Mr. Ma's empire, last month.     

Investors took Mr. Ma's reappearance as an auspicious        sign--Alibaba's Hong        Kong-listed shares jumped 8.5% Wednesday. They may have        inferred that Mr. Ma is now back in Beijing's        good graces and the regulatory storm will be over. But there doesn't        seem to be a letup: on the same day Mr. Ma made his        public appearance, China's        central bank released draft rules governing nonbank payment systems, in        which Ant's Alipay        is a major player.     

There are still uncertainties about what some of the draft rules mean.        The rules, for example, say if two players have more than two-thirds of        the nonbank payment markets--Alipay        and Tencent's WeChat Pay        dominate China's        mobile and internet payments--then the central bank would hold talks        with the companies. It's unclear what the exact consequences or remedies        would be after such warnings, though. The rules also seem to use a        broader definition of market--possibly including some traditional        payment channels--to determine whether a payment company is        market-dominating.     

But the overall direction seems clear: the government wants stricter        regulation of fast-growing online financial services, which could add        systemic risks to the country's state-dominated financial system. Beijing        likely views China's        ubiquitous mobile payment systems as a positive contribution to society,        but it is more skeptical when companies like Ant leverage their user        base and consumer data to jump into online lending.     

Mr. Ma's latest public appearance is a new episode in the        continuing saga, but the drama is far from over.

SELL NOW BEFORE IT TANKS if ANY of you retards can even afford contracts _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Inverse guh _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NVAX: A Fortnight, Bottlenecks, and IMMINENT Efficacy Data (urgent) The point of this post is to describe why I think Novavax ($NVAX) will be releasing efficacy data in the next week and explain why I have decided to buy weekly options until data comes out for the biggest possible return.

**tl;dr:**

1. Data is coming in the next week.
2. IV on options expiring next week is going to go through the roof on Friday afternoon.
3. High likelihood of good data.
4. Buy now.

For quick context, as of today NVAX will be the 4th COVID vaccine to release Phase 3 efficacy data, though they have already secured the most government contracts. Currently, Novavax is in a phase 2B trial in South Africa, a phase 3 trial in the UK and a phase 3 trial in US/Mexico. The release of South Africa and UK efficacy data is imminent (see reasons why I think data will be released next week below). This data is a significant catalyst as, up until this point, no efficacy data has been released from NVAX, other than non-human primates (which was best in class relative to competing vaccines).

As for what that data will entail, there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic that I will not get into in this post. I am a medical student and am more than happy to discuss further if needed, but for starters I recommend reading the 4 posts by [u/Upstairs\_Speech](https://www.reddit.com/u/Upstairs_Speech/) on why NVAX is deeply undervalued and has a high chance of success. The only thing I would add to their posts is the robust antibody response (significantly higher than MRNA and PFE) after 6 months, as shown on [slide 17](https://ir.novavax.com/static-files/84a85933-d43f-438e-9dd3-32a023129da7) of their JPM presentation two weeks ago, which as a result has gotten many immunologists excited.

We have seen the share price impact of released efficacy data before. For reference, Pfizer added $15B to their market cap after release of efficacy data in November and Moderna doubled its market cap in November (from 30 to 60B). NVAX has a market cap currently of $8B (16% that of Moderna) - and that includes the valuation for a separate influenza vaccine that completed Phase 3 in March 2020. I think a 40+% immediate increase is reasonable following good data and I think NVAX will continue to grow to be multiples higher than current levels in a few months. A 40% increase from current levels would take the share price to $175 which would net a 10x or greater return. NVAX hit $190 share price last year after the primate data, it could certainly go higher than 175.

Here are the reasons why I think NVAX will provide data in the next week:

1. At JPM's healthcare conference on January 11 their CEO said data would be "in a few weeks" and has repeatedly said data would be in "early Q1."
2. At the same conference their Chief Commercial Officer said South Africa data would come first and UK would follow shortly after in late January/early February but could be sooner due to the high burden of disease in those two countries. Here are a couple recent news articles highlighting how out of control the situation is: [UK article](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-coronavirus-uk-variant-cases-2021-1) and [South Africa article](https://www.theafricareport.com/57277/south-africa-new-coronavirus-variant-rages-alongside-vaccine-finance-debate/).
3. On January 13, the following South Africa news [source](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/novavaxs-south-african-phase-iib-covid-19-vaccine-trial-likely-to-reveal-results-within-next-fortnight-source-says/) said Novavax had completed its data entry with the government and results would be revealed in the next "fortnight" which implies results coming out by next Wednesday at the latest.
4. The screenshot in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/someguymg/status/1351237225636360194?s=20) from two days ago from a seemingly reliable Facebook vaccine group where a study participant in the UK had been told by a sponsor that Novavax had completed the 50 events for an interim analysis.
5. The New York Academy of Sciences announced a [webinar](https://www.nyas.org/events/2021/webinar-the-quest-for-a-covid-19-vaccine/?tab=agenda) on February 2-3. Novavax is attending alongside Pfizer and Moderna and their President of R&D is giving an "Efficacy Data Update." Earlier stage vaccines are only giving "updates" so we know that at the very latest we will have data by February 2 and I believe it will be much earlier than the New York Academy of Sciences presentation.
6. Pfizer, Moderna and Astrazeneca have all released news before market on Mondays, so given the combination of the points above I think we will be getting data next Monday morning and if not, definitely sometime next week.

Currently IV is so high on Novavax that I have been opposed to buying calls a few weeks out, as it kills potential returns. So for the last two weeks I have bought small amounts of calls on Friday that expire the following week. I am buying significantly more this week for options expiring next Friday due to my confidence in imminent data.

Lastly, on January 8, before the JPM presentation, IV went over 200 and that was with a monthly expiration that had strikes going over $220. There is a bottleneck of availability of strikes on next week calls (expiring January 29) as they only go up to $170. On Friday afternoon IV will go through the roof on these higher strike calls so now is the time to get in.

**Positions:**

1/29: Strikes 150, 155, 160, 165, 170 - anything you can get your hands on

As an aside, some have expressed concern that NVAX, a relatively unproven biotech company, may not have the ability to ramp up production and/or the US trial is too late for the vaccine to get traction. Those worries are WAY overblown in my opinion. Now’s not the time to get deep into that, but here’s some quick reasons why:

1. NVAX currently has more than 1.6 billion doses already ordered from countries around the globe. Pricing is consistent globally at \~$16 per dose (do the math on revenue and think about other biotech firms trading at 2-3x revenue… we should see the market bake a lot of that in once positive phase 3 data is released).
2. NVAX has made acquisitions and partnerships (incl. Praha vaccines, Serum Institute of India and Baxter in Germany) over the last year to ensure production capacity is ready once regulatory approval is granted.
3. FDA has [signaled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/19/novavax-vaccines-clinical-trials/) it is willing to rely on the UK interim data to grant emergency use approval._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB Refueling Long term prospects still hold Fundamentals still hold: Great integrations with AWS etc and strong brand name in security.

My first 10x. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apple price target upgraded to $152 by Morgan Stanley, ''Investors aren’t optimistic enough about Apple Inc.’s upcoming earnings report'' 🚀🚀🚀 While the consensus forecast models record holiday-quarter revenue of $102.5 billion for Apple, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty has an even rosier view of how the company performed late last year.

She expects the company to post fiscal first-quarter revenue of $108.2 billion driven by strong iPhone 12 sales, and she boosted her price target on Apple’s stock to $152 from $144 ahead of next Wednesday’s report. Huberty also expects record earnings per share of $1.50, above the $1.41 that analysts surveyed by FactSet are projecting.

Huberty called the iPhone 12 “Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” which she said likely set the company up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. Consumers seem to be opting for higher-priced iPhone models with bigger and more expansion storage configurations, she wrote, a boon for margins.
She isn’t so concerned about potential weakness for the smaller iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini models, since she said those devices are more popular in international markets with more price-conscious consumers. Apple also looks poised to continue benefiting from challenges at China’s Huawei, she argued, as the rate of customers switching from Huawei to Apple is at a 15-month high.

Other product categories could also be set up well amid the pandemic. “Sustained work and learn from home demand coupled with a strong holiday season give us confidence in our above consensus iPad, Mac and Wearables December-quarter forecast,” Huberty wrote. Though she’s slightly below the consensus forecast with her services projections, she sees opportunity for upside there as the App Store appeared to have another strong quarter. Her main concern on services is that AppleCare purchases are often tied to in-store shopping, which isn’t as prevalent given store closures and stay-home trends.

TLDR: Apple to the 🌕 incoming 🚀

As the market moves up and down, it's important (to me)to take note of where the relatively larger volume is traded.

&#x200B;

As you can hopefully see clearly on my 5 minute markup, volume comes into the market beneath the highs, as opposed to people taking profit and exiting positions at the highs (which im sure there is some of) it looks like this weeks volume comes in after a high is made and a discount is offered.

&#x200B;

This is good for your rockets.

PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. 

**A case for longs:**

Palantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR

Palantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. 

PLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?

"Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems."

Competitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is "unethical" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(search\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). 

I'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. 

**Forward thinking**

PLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. 

My short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. 

Long term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*

2)$DDD 2 weeks ago the largest 3D printer company just seemingly gapped up 50% in one day.  if any of you boys watch the market and I'm sure you all do you know that Kathy has a 3D printer ETF.  $prnt.  In a market with everything sitting at all time highs The only green sector that that hasn't fully reached its potential is 3 printing. 
 
3) I've looked through all these 3D companies and the only one that has good options and highest potential as well as speculative growth is $nndm.  

4) nndm manufacturers printers that cost 200 to 300k. Right now they're between 80 to 100 of these printers around the world.  These printers make microchips. Microchips used in medical devices.  They ultimately save third world countries millions upon millions of dollars who could otherwise not afford to buy the products from the big name manufacturers, which in turn will increase their standards of living exponentially.   What they can do is make generic forms via 3d printers and fashion similar chips.
They have no choice and this is the best and only solution for them.

5) finally it's not just the printers that make $nndm money, it's the accessories you need to purchase alongside the printers (think INK) that will continue to generate huge gains for nndM indefinitely

Tldr; can't afford medical devices bc you're a poor country?  Print the chips and devices yourself for 1/100 of the cost.  Will those chips work? I don't know but it's better than the alternative which is do nothing.  This dragonfly printer will be bought by industries within those countries and subcontracted out by the hospitals until it's perfected via trial and error.  It's fucking global human progress.  You might be asking who gives a f*** about benefiting third world countries and increasing their standards of living Im in it for the money not for philanthropy.  Fuck me. Go read.  It's fucking international Global commerce and fixing a labor shortage.  You'd be surprised how the mindset of an individual changes to prosper when he's not at risk of death by 50.    
Get your exposure to the new Green movement in 3D printing.  Market cap of nndm is 3 bill.

**Sun Tzu, Art of War**

*Everything was for tomorrow, but tomorrow never came. The present was only a bridge and on this bridge they are still groaning, as the world groans, and not one idiot ever thinks of blowing up the bridge.*

**Henry Miller, Tropic of Capricorn**

*I was wrong! Blow the bridge! Blow the fucking bridge!*

**Tugg Speedman, Tropic Thunder**

Hello again GME Gang! It’s been a while since I last ranted at you, but I know we’ve been in some very good hands here at WSB with all the great DD folks have posted over the past few weeks. So no need for CPT Hubbard go for 11 again on the Thumbscroll Dial (until today, that is). I’ve enjoyed a lot of these posts very much, so thank you on behalf of myself and the attention-deficient Rocket Children for continuing to deliver that 100% Chaff-Free GME-grade Wheat at such a feverish clip.

Now, I am going to get to Hong Kong’s [Lamest Outlaw](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2009448/hong-kong-finds-citron-researchs-andrew-left) and his disconcertingly vacant eyes here shortly. But first I want to take you on a journey back to Christmas Eve, in the year of our lord 2020—a heady time in all our lives. We were all so young and innocent then, weren’t we? Fresh off the run up to 22. Blissfully oblivious that we were living in the last moments where the question What is The War of 1812? was the only acceptable Jeopardy question for the answer: The Last Time the Goddamn U.S. Capitol Was Stormed. This was also before we all became irresponsibly overleveraged in Cathie Wood’s Ornamental Gourds ETF. It was a wondrous, confusing time.

But before we get too off topic, let’s all hop in my 1985 DeLorean (purchased with proceeds from my Jan 15 calls – thanks RC!), fire up the ol’ Flux Capacitor, and get that shit to 88 because something happened that evening that is Worth Pondering—particularly in light of recent events. And just as a friendly reminder: even though you’re going back in time in a DeLorean, no one here has to deviate funds away from GME shares to Save the Clock Tower and you are under no obligation to fulfill a scenario where you wind up making out with your Mom (unless your Mom is Cathie Wood like mine—in which case maybe just some quick over-the-clothes stuff).

**On the Subject of How It Once ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas**

So what in the holy fuck happened on the night before Christmas, Captain? Well, while all you Gentiles were sleeping soundly after lying to your children about benign home intruders and before gorging yourself on the teat of late-stage capitalism, me and the rest of the Chosen People were up late eating Chinese food and thinking about tendies (self-hating Jew Joke! Ba-zing!). But then: when out on the electric twitter machine there arose such a clatter, I sprang to my phone to see what was the matter. And what to my wondering eyes did appear, a mysterious tweet from a Rich-Ass Viking who had a lot of fucking interesting things to say about this whole GME situation that’s what.

This tweet, buried as a reply to a tweet sent by Mr. Rod Alzmann (@RodAlzmann or [u/Uberkikz11](https://www.reddit.com/u/Uberkikz11/)), simply said: “Merry Christmas. Shhh.” But it included this screen shot:

\[\*\*Image Deleted Due to the Mods - check the link below where someone transcribed it - I'll try to add later\*\*\]

Now, this tweet to Rod, sent late at night and likely after a strong Mead or three, was very promptly deleted. But your intrepid cub reporter saw this here tweet that night with his own two eyes—seeing as I am a degenerate GME addict and devoted follower of Mr. Rod Alzmann (Hi Rod!). And I took screenshots, of course, like any responsible records custodian might. And so did the dude who wrote a somewhat-overlooked WSB post on this, which included the most pertinent text of the message if you are having trouble reading it here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas\_miracle\_gamergate\_2020\_gme\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas_miracle_gamergate_2020_gme_shorts/)

Now, what are we to make of this? At the time, I thought it was very interesting. But I did not give it too much attention seeing as how the internet is overcrowded with anonymous weirdos claiming to know more than they do about all sorts of subjects (and now I feel your judging eyes…). Also, there was some very good commentary in that WSB post from some sharp folks about the screenshot author’s questionable use of the shorthand PE/IB—given that private equity and investment banks wouldn’t apparently be involved in a behind-the-scenes transaction with the short funds like what was being discussed there (don’t ask me, I just string together silly words here). But maybe you poke around his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne) a bit and see for yourself.

Still, plausibility assessments based on preferred nomenclature aside, it seemed to me that some version of that conversation **had** to be taking place behind the scenes in a situation like this—given the batshit insane short interest, the funds supposedly involved, and the rapid rise in SP coinciding with RC’s share accumulation, December 21st amended 13D filing, and new status as a GME Insider and Board member (just love saying all that in a row, don’t you?).

So the Viking’s screenshot tweet, and the very likely possibility that shorts are in so deep that they’re attempting to negotiate peace with large shareholders behind the scenes, stuck in my tiny little baby brain as a pretty plausible set of scenarios. And from the look of it, it seems like some funds were at least willing to discuss offering these shorts a Golden Bridge away from Certain Fucking Destruction on the open market. And if the words on the screenshot are at all aligned with reality, these short funds have no good options. Yet it seems like they are still playing hardball to negotiate the carat on this generous bridge offer they’re getting. Why? Maybe they’ve been getting high on their own supply for so long and they don’t know how to see this situation for what it is. Who knows? Maybe there is no Ryan Cohen and we’re all living in a simulation. But if the recent low-rent anti-GME articles and market manipulation efforts we’re seeing are any indication, these overleveraged short fuckers seem to think they’re going to be able to spin out of this hold and drive the SP back down to even *smaller* peanuts than it’s at now by sheer force of will (and some deployment of well-honed tricks of the trade *amirite*?) to emerge unscathed. Or even victorious? I dunno—it’s their delusional fantasy sequence.

But do you know what this scenario reminds me of? And this is just coming to me so please bear with me as I’m not showing this to my editor before we print (I haven’t seen this movie in ages – don’t know what made me think of this!). Fuck it, I’m just gonna start riffing here. The shorts trying to thread this needle, against all odds and logic and common sense, reminds me of that hilarious scene in Dumb and Dumber where haplessly delusional Jim Carrey thinks he has a chance with Mary Samsonite Swanson. But the scene is funny because he really doesn’t. Have any chance. At all.

Now, I know this is a 1990s movie originally released on VHS that we haven’t seen or seen it referenced in ages. But now that you’re thinking of it again after all this time, doesn’t it remind you of this too? I know, I get it: You’d have to have fucking peanuts for brains for it not to.

**On the Subject of the Continued Internet Bumbling of Mr. Justin Dopierala**

Now that screenshot came to mind this past week when something kind of weird happened while we were all enjoying our quick rocket ship ride. And yes, we are briefly going to talk again about Seeking Alpha’s second finest pro-GME author (always been more of a Dmitriy man myself) and recurring CPT Hubbard character, Justin Dopierala (and no, Angela, I do not want to have like 10,000 of his babies).

Last Thursday, after we were all virtually high-fiving one another and counting our future Lambos, Mr. Justin Dopierala, head of Domo Capital and longstanding uber-bull GME shareholder and author at Seeking Alpha (last seen arguing pithily with our own Rod Alzmann about the conservative nature of Rod’s holiday earnings projections. Hi again Rod!), made it known that he sold all of Domo Capital’s 500,000 shares for around $42.50—at the very top of the run up last Thursday morning.

Now, Domo Capital’s business decisions are none of my goddamn business. And there are plenty of market opportunities right now. Shit, I hear there is even a new Cathie Wood Gourd ETF coming online soon that people are really excited about and that I’m sure Justin’s clients would find intriguing. But Domo’s decision to sell seemed curious given a few things: (1) on Wednesday, when the rocket is mid-flight, he got a twitter follow from Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, which he promptly tweeted about with a “get a load of this fuckin’ guy” vibe (oh the sweet, intoxicating arrogance of tendie victory, I too love it so); (2) he had also tweeted that day comparing GME’s rise to Apron’s short squeeze that lasted 4 days—where he also stressed to his followers that Apron had a *much lower* SI than GME; and (3) he then promptly **deleted** all of these tweets and almost everything else GME-related on Thursday after apparently introducing 500,000 shares of liquidity into the height of a stressed market up and through the Thursday reversal and to his own personal tendie town.

Now, after seeing all this, I mouthed off a bit to Justin on the electric twitter machine because that’s kind of my thing. And if you are familiar with my prior ramblings, you know that he and I go way back. In response, Justin talked a bit of shit about your intrepid cub reporter here in a comment on Dimitry Kozin’s October 21, 2020 Article about a possible Sony Revenue Share deal or something, the comment section of which has become the preferred SA water cooler over there. (And I can’t link that because Thems The Rulez). And Justin hurt my little feelings a bit with very sharp denial. And by all means have at it over there to check out his comment about why he sold if you give a shit. That is if Justin hasn’t deleted it yet. Free country and all.

But to summarize, on the subject of treacherous coordination with Melvin Capital, Justin said he would not could not in a boat and he would not could not with a goat. And I for one believe him. And do you know why? Because even though Justin seems like a very smart guy in some ways, he’s also a well-known internet bumbler who blurts out things to his internet friends that a person with better self-control would keep to themselves. And so I do not think he is capable of pulling that off or keeping a secret like that. Also: he said he didn’t so I am more than willing to give someone the benefit of any doubt in that area and you should too. I think we keep Hanlon’s razor firmly in mind here about never attributing to malice that which is explained by stupidity. That is unless, of course, you’re Andrew Left and you’re actually trying to convince people that you didn’t realize there was a US presidential inauguration planned for the same time you announced your Super Important TeeVee Yammerfest ‘21 about GME not being a good candidate for an imminent short squeeze no way no how not if my name isn’t Andrew Left short seller expert extraordinaire and Hong Kong’s Most Misunderstood Ethically-Minded Businessman. You can ascribe the fuck out of malice to that one.

No, even though I really have no idea, I think the most likely thing that happened there was that Gabe Plotkin, Master of the Universe, Head of Melvin Capital, and Acolyte of Perennial Most Ethical Business Man MVP candidate, Steven Cohen—got into Justin’s head when Plotkin followed him on twitter during the 57% (at one point 94%) day last Wednesday and then Justin got a bit chippy about it.

And this is the real reason I’m bringing this up.

Because I honestly care very little about the Nervous Investing Habits of the Wisconsin hedge fund voted most likely to prompt a Mr. Roboto reference. No: I think that Gabe Plotkin sent a message with that follow. Without even ever having to say it directly. And I think that after GME’s huge run and getting a little overexcited while working the twitter machine, Justin maybe had a chance to relax with a warm glass of milk that night and reflect on that message. Which I believe was: ***I’m watching you, motherfucker***. *And the only reason I’m paying any attention to some shitstain Wisconsin pseudo-fund on a day like today when I am getting my ass fucking torched is because I want you to know that if this GME shit blows up on me, I’m going to fuck your ass up.* *I will remember the name Domo Capital forevermore.* *And when you least expect me, I’ll be there. Now: your move, motherfucker.*

And once I realized what might have happened there, that made me feel kinda bad for Justin if he felt that way. Definitely a puss move because fuck you Plotkin I drink your fucking milkshake, right? But bad because that’s a mean message for a business colleague to send, Gabriel. Shame on you if that's how you roll like a big New York bully and scaring our poor Justin like that. And if you just wanted to follow him to shoot the shit or swap listicles and Star Wars Prequel memes with a respected contemporary—even in the very midst of getting fucking annihilated while short GME—well Justin has a totally different account for that and he’s not allowed to access it during work hours.

Are you back? I’ve missed you. That was scary, wasn’t it? But allow me to **TL/DR** all that for you who decided to avoid all that unpleasantness: the dude just has all this bad luck and keeps finding himself into these really awkward situations where someone could potentially question his commitment to ethical business and life practices as well as adherence to the laws of the United States and it’s just not fair and nothing’s fair and Nice Guy Steve Cohen Is The Victim Here So Just Stop Right There Mister I See What You’re Doing. He's also bros with Guy Fieri. Cool.

But why am I talking about a guy who would so clearly pass Billy Madison’s Final Question about Business Ethics without even breaking a sweat?

Because Steve Cohen once had a young Ace Protegee that he loved very much. With the name of an Archangel, so tender and pure. And one day this young man decided he wanted to Prove Himself and Leave Steve’s Nest. And thus was born Melvin Capital, seeded financially by Steve Cohen but named after famed Crooner Melvin H. Tormé, which Gabe’s esteemed mentor Steve would play in his office, over and over, all those years ago.

Now let’s fast forward a bit because I’m boring myself with all that fucking Cohen reading (the *bad* Cohen—don’t you dare get anyone confused here). As I was saying: Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, has by all accounts gotten himself into a bit of a pickle here being so deeply short GME. Lots of people have analyzed and overanalyzed it, and I’m not going to do it again here; that dead horse is well and truly beaten. But to bottom line it: we’re all just staring down what is essentially an unprecedented math problem that will, at some point, resolve itself. And if it revolves itself in favor of the Good Guys, then the Bad Guys will lose a Fuck-ton of Money. That’s your money block quote, WSJ, so fuck off and stop calling me.

Now: picture yourself as a Steve Cohen acolyte that just bought a [$44M Miami Compound](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2020/12/07/melvin-capital-founder-revealed-as-buyer-of-44m-miami-beach-property-sources/) and who cannot stop talking about how [co-owning the Charlotte Hornets](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/charlotte-hornets/article232128902.html) is worth it just for the courtsides alone bro once basketball is a thing again and so what if Michael Jordan keeps calling him Gary it’s close enough. Are you feeling the most financially secure that you have ever felt in your young rich life right about now? Or might you be a wee bit worried that you’ve pursued an investment thesis so reckless, so irrationally and intentionally destructive of equity, that even Melvin H. Tormé himself must be rolling in his fucking grave that you would ever dare put at risk your ability to continue being Michael Jordan’s Gary?

And so here is when I again link my good buddy Jim Cramer’s [Great Unveiling of the Tactics Deployed by Short Sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l09n23/it_all_makes_sense_about_cramer_now_if_youre/) hoping to change the narrative and construct a “new truth” to suppress the SP in the face of, oh, let’s just say: a very promising turnaround story in a high-growth industry by An E-Commerce Canadian Genius who does not fuck around and who knows what he’s fucking doing and aims to sell more and better video games experiences to crackhead video gamers and there’s a million things he wants to do but just you wait, just you wait.

Is this plot that hard to follow?

And I’ll also say this: I know fuck-all about monitoring order flows or how funds continue to create synthetic shares to short shit into oblivion. But I’m just stepping back and thinking of the broader narrative and tactics on this. Spit-balling here again—bear with me. Now, if you were massively short a security while paying out your ass in borrowing fees for the privilege of entering the most crowded short trade in the market and you’re now opposite a massive business turnaround story, Ryan Cohen, numerous institutions, funds, retail whales, Norwegian HNW Freemason Consortiums, and the energy behind the Finest Rocket Children Ever to Grace Planet Fucking Earth—and you’re taking it in the ass week after week here—Do you then play this straight? Do you set aside all of these illegal and deceptive short tactics Jim Cramer candidly outlines in that video even though they’re impossible to enforce and are in fact *not* enforced? That Jim basically says you’d be professionally negligent if you were short and didn’t do this shit because fuck it *whosgonnastopyou*? And now you fucked up and that steamroller is barreling down upon you and there are all these things you *could theoretically* do try to get yourself out of this jam if you were That Kind of Person? Do you set this all aside and, at least in Jim’s view, tie one hand behind your precious ethical back? On the most heavily shorted stock off all time where you are bleeding Real Life Big-Boy Money? Just buying and selling you know, just a job, nothing much to it, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, can't get too carried away with it.

*Or is it something a little bit fucking different than that?*

I don’t know. I’m not in the industry myself. And I would never accuse anyone of doing anything so clearly contrary to the values upon which their professional career as Master of the Universe was built. So Gabe: chill. Don’t follow me or something on twitter man, since for all I know that’s Plotkinese for I Hope You Don’t Mind Sleeping With This Severed Horse Head in Your Bed Motherfucker. It’s just money, dude. You seem pretty well taken care of. But man would I be sweating if I were short right now staring down the barrel of your new neighbor Ryan Cohen’s whims and patience and polite Canadian manners and ambiguous emojis that we all lose our shit for. I mean, fuck man: are you ok? Don’t forgot to exercise and eat well during all this. Maybe switch to green tea or something. And remember: you’ll always—always—be Michael Jordan’s Gary.

But here is where we return to our good friend Andrew Left from Citron Research.

Do you remember the excitement you felt this past weekend? I’ve never seen WSB so jacked. People were coming out hot on Tuesday—an uptick day! The new phone book’s here! The new phone book's here! What luck to be free of Gary’s tomfoolery for one fine day. And then GME spiked right away—reaching a high of over $45 that morning.

But then something happened. We all know what it was. But here is where any SEC lookie-loos need to close those Pornhub links and pay closer attention. Because in the moments before the Citron tweet that morning about Andy’s upcoming BuzzFeed Listicle call on Why GME is Scary Investment GRRRR, total short shares available **dropped from 1.2M to 0**. And a **$300K put bet** was placed on a weekly with a strike price well over 10% out of the money at the very moment that GME’s price was accelerating rapidly. (H/t [u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatAspirations/)). That’s some WSB-level retard shit right there, whoever you are.

And yet they pull it off! GME immediately shoots down nearly 30% intraday, and eventually climbing abck up above 10%, making us all feel a little weird and like ungrateful millennial brats for feeling so shitty about a 10% day. But we all know what fucking happened, now don’t we?

So what can we say about ol’ Andy? Well, just like future call-back candidate for the role of Frightened Inmate #2, Mr. Steve Cohen, Andy is also but a Caveman—frightened and confused by your modern concepts of “ethics” and “rules.” No! No!—He’s a straight shooter! Devoted to rooting out obvious frauds, like Lukin Coffee and TSLA (Do not fuck with Elon or my Hot Mom’s ETF, Andy). And like the aspirations of Antoine Bugle Boy when he entered the blue jeans market, Andy saw an overcrowded short trade here based on an overly simplistic and obsolete short thesis about GME and said: “Me Too!” And as this thing is ripping to the stratosphere, Andy starts ringing his dumb dumb twitter bell and saying hear ye, hear ye—Inauguration Day and time it shall be for all my Big Brain thoughts about GME! Nothing weird about that. No sir.

Now, many of you know Andy as the dumbshit who shorted TSLA until he was ground into little bits of dumb dumb dust and made to look ever so foolish over and over again until he finally cried drunk uncle and flipped to being long TSLA and now he’s cool to you or whatever. Or you might know him as the guy who puts out really shoddy research that often, by pure happenstance, drives a new narrative to control the orderflow and SP on a WSB-beloved security like PLTR? You know the guy I’m talking about. Once in hot pursuit by Hong Kong fuzz, an International Man of Obviousness with a face that says: why yes, I *will* have another vodka tonic *thankyouverymuch*. That’s him.

So Andy Citron or whatever the fuck his name is will be putting out some dumbshit video or something today in what seems to be a pretty clear attempt to scare my poor Rocket Children and get those pesky computers to high frequency this shit to drive the SP down to more acceptable loss levels (cause let’s be honest: they’re still taking a fucking bath here) for Melvin H. Tormé’s namesake hedgefund and all the other cretins that are dug into short position here. And they’re gonna try to scare ya’ with the color red! And they know that no one here likes the color red.

But do see what’s going on here and who we’re dealing with. This really ain’t rocket science, Rocket Children. The dude actually tried to claim he forgot about the Inauguration. In 2021. He has not been in a coma, to the best of my knowledge. Btw, you look a little bleary eyed, Andy. Must have been all that staying up super late working on those last few bullet points to fill out the powerpoint on that GME listicle of yours, eh sport?

**Conclusion: On the Subject of Patience and The Arc of The Universe Bending Toward Ryan Fucking Cohen**

*In my youth there was a period of time where I went out on boats that would drop crates into the waters of the Arctic. Bundled inside them were raw pieces of meat. In the coming days the boats would head back out to the frigid seas, hook the floats bobbing upon the waters, and pull the crates up. Packed inside would be many crabs. They were so delicious & made a good price at market. The difference between the crate that was empty and the create full of bounty was a mystery even the great physicist Erwin Schrödinger pondered at much length.*

*But the hearty fishermen of my youth already knew the answer long ago. Why did the trap fill up? Time. In time, all traps fill. In time, all things pondered shall be revealed.*

**--The Fucking Viking, That’s Who**

Now look, you all know I have a soft spot for Ryan Cohen. Hell, we all do. He’s a good dude. And the man has played this flawlessly so far. He really has. The fact that we are all sitting here with Ryan Cohen having successfully negotiated three seats on the Board—a bloodless coup as my man Rod Alzmann says—here in January? It’s amazing. His vision for GME is dialed-the-fuck in and extremely exciting. This misunderstood business is on the threshold of an exciting turnaround with Ryan Cohen at the helm. And though I was very much looking forward to the potential repercussions of a vote being called at the annual meeting and what that might mean for the short-term share price, this result is infinitely better. Whatever their motivations, that Board and George Sherman saw the writing on the wall here and accepted the Golden Bridge that Ryan offered them. And Ryan Cohen has done everything he’s set out to do here. And he’s clearly been having fun while doing it. Read up on the guy at some point if you haven’t–there’s lots of good DD out there on him, obviously. And while you’re reading and thinking about Ryan Cohen, think also about guys like Steve Cohen (*no* *fucking relation*) and Gabe Plotkin and Andy Left and how lucky we are that we get to roll with RC against that motley crew of fuckwads.

And do you know what? I’m guessing that RC, and maybe even the funds being discussed in that screenshot, have been very patient with Mr. Plotkin *et al* in recent weeks. You don’t go around bankrupting hedge funds willy nilly, you know--bad form and all that old chap. People tend to remember that. And guys like Steve Cohen and Gabe Plotkin seem like they play for keeps. So now you try to build them a Golden Bridge to cross—maybe not their preferred route of travel, but could be worse and all that, right guys? But for whatever reason it seems like the natural instinct here on the short side is fight over flight. And these short FUD tactics are getting increasingly ridiculous to help slow down the inevitable march toward the detonator right next to that bridge. So relax everyone! And let’s not fool ourselves: All those Masters of the Universes are well aware of the math problem they’re all facing here and they must have a vague grasp of the odds that this goes off in one direction over the other. And what that could mean for the size of their money pits and how many sports teams they can buy this year. Shit, I assume Steve Cohen is counseling his young acolyte about how many sads he himself felt deep down in his man heart on that fateful day in 2008 when he lost $250M on a short when Volkswagon squeezed to infinity—a sadness that he will continue to draw on when his agent finally finds him a role that calls for it.

But my point is: the longs here can afford to be patient and let this play out. When this thing moves, the Viking’s Schrödinger crabs will only be in one fucking pot. And I’m guessing that pot is the one being held by the guy who is actually in total fucking control here: Ryan Goddamn Cohen.

So enjoy the show today. If you’re anything like me, you’re feeling relaxed after gorging yourself on lucky space peanuts all week. And though these silly wabbits with their cumbersome FUD efforts can get a bit tiresome, I’m still very much enjoying this GME show at this point and almost do not want it to end—what with all these Sorkin-esque twists and turns and my Cohen Tweet Decorder Ring getting all this sweet action.

But just remember who Ryan Cohen is, what he cares about, and what, so far, he has told us he intends to do here. And then you might realize, as I have, that Ryan Cohen has had the Gray’s Sports Almanac here all along. This story has already been written. He’s already won. And Melvin Capital’s Schrödinger-ass crabs are dead as fuck. The only question now is: what causes that Golden Bridge to blow? I, for one, am content to wait on RC while counting my good fortune that I can continue to accumulate until whatever happens here happens. So pass the rocket peanuts.

It’s just money after all. Right Gabe?

**TL/DR**: *Psst*: a Mysterious Viking once told me about behind-the-scenes Golden Bridge negotiations that are likely taking place that give shorts no chance but the shorts seem to think they’re saying there’s a chance but there really is no chance; Gabe Plotkin, Steve Cohen and Andy Left are misunderstood Straight Shooters who probably answer typical interview questions about their own perceived weaknesses by saying “Sometimes I just care *too much* about doing the right thing”; and Ryan Cohen is the Goddamn Man so we can all relax and not worry so much about all this dumb short FUD bullshit, ok? OK. **🚀🚀🚀**

Be Gentle on me. $BB *Insert Rocket Emoji x 100* _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR (Corsair) + GME DD 🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀 TL;DR: CRSR looks like a bargain at $36/share and low market cap at 3 bil. PC gaming bout to explode. Check the market for this shit. GME PC build stations? Which products they gonna stock? Best in class of course (from a dedicated gaming company). Oh, and Corsair is developing affordable and accessible streaming hardware to a generation of kids who live in front of their screens and meet their friends in games? Hello, moon.

🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜

So, over the past couple weeks, our beloved savior GME has truly nutted the fuck up under the astounding tutelage of Ryan 🥜 Cohen. We’ve learned that Cohen and friends are likely (or definitely, depending on which store you call) pushing for PC build stations in brick and mortar GameStop stores. Just a matter of time before this happens (suck my dick, COVID). If you’re like me, this news made your 2-inch, Cohen-ready pen0r stand at ultimate attention. 

🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀

As of now, PC builds are fucking confusing for consumers attempting to enter the space. While PCs provide a much better gaming experience, as well as greater modification opportunities, for consumers, it’s intimidating as fuck for people eager to enter the space. I, for one, tried to dig into this during the summer, and I was stonewalled by: A. An overwhelming amount of options; B. Conflicting information; C. Lack of knowledge in building my own PC. 

If only I had someone who could just fucking tell me what to buy and what to do to create and build a PC that fits my budget while providing an in-person experience with physical products on display... Because what the fuck am I even looking at on MicroCenter.com? And why, when I go to MicroCenter, do every single one of those tie-wearing FUCKS try to sell me Norton anti-virus??? As a gamer, I’d much rather be sold a Gamepass subscription, honestly... (GME + MSFT DD).

🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀

Now, when I walk into GameStop and head to the PC build station, which products are going to be stocked???? 

Well, after combing through Reddit, as well as tapping the knowledge of my PC-gaming friends who’ve been doing this shit since I was jerking it to fuzzy, late-night, X-rated cable stations (you mini autists don’t know a thing about the struggle pre-PornHub), the consensus was very clear:

Corsair makes the best shit. They’re the best at what they do. Albeit a bit overpriced... but the best in class. And PC people don’t mind spending top-dollar for long lasting gear (PC Master Race or whatever, okay, cool, ya fuckin neckbeard Nazi). 

🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀

So what does Corsair make that’s so great? Some of the most important shit you need for a build, as well as peripherals:

- CPU/GPU coolers
- SSDs
- Cases 
- Keyboards 
- Mice 
- Speakers 
Etc etc 

What is most exciting about Corsair in the near future is their push for selling affordable streaming hardware. Check this shit out: [Corsair & Elgato ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/news/corsair-acquires-epoccam-app-to-boost-elgato-game-streaming-business)

These young kids aren’t even getting their fucking LICENSE TO DRIVE A CAR because all their stupid fucking friends are online circlejerking to Fortnite streams. These kids don’t even play the game. They watch someone else stream a fucking game. Okay, whatever. But now these kids are gonna wanna stream for themselves. Why? Because: A. They can’t leave their house because they didn’t get a fucking license; B. They idolize a Twitch streamer and think the epitome of life’s success lies in the ability to tap some buttons faster than someone else and if you can show your friends how fast you tap buttons you’re God.

So... When I walk into GameStop to build my PC, and I wanna be the next cool streamer, what the fuck am I gonna buy?

- CORSAIR CPU COOLING UNIT
- CORSAIR GPU COOLING UNIT
- CORSAIR KEYBOARD
- CORSAIR MOUSE
- CORSAIR SPEAKERS 
- CORSAIR STREAMING CHIP 
- CORSAIR HEADPHONES 
- CORSAIR FUCKIN CONDOMS WITH RYAN COHEN’S SMUG LITTLE FACE ON THE GODDAMN TIP!!!!

🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀🥜🚀

So why am I loading up on CRSR now? It’s a bargain-bin price, from my perspective. It looks absolutely delicious around $36. 3 bil market cap? Best in class? Dedicated to ensuring quality hardware for customers, and dedicated to the space? 

When GME opens their PC build stations, I have a strong erection in my pants telling me that Corsair will be there, and PC gaming is about to get a whole lot more popular. 

TO THE MOON!

VIAC is the pick of the year! I’ve been trying to inform the great community for the past 2 months. VIAC is the next big pick for WSB and the markets are taking notice before the WSB can get in on the fun. 

Yes I’m trying to help! Yes I want the tendies! And yes you probably think this is stupid, what are you talking about GME all day bro. TSLA to the moon bro. 

No stop it. I’m talking about one of the most undervalued stocks in the hottest market segment, no this is not a motley fool boomer pitch, this is Viacomcbs. This is the fucking rocket ship. We are looking at a 4-5 x return once streaming potential is even partially realized.

Little secret, VIAC is n third place in streaming with 18 million paid subs. Other plays are stuck with their botched launch, VIAC has 2 services that have been profitable and open for 6 plus years. CBS All access soon to be paramount plus and showtime. 

The biggest play for the company isn’t paid streaming although it will be a huge piece of business. No the real opportunity is in Pluto TV which is the leading FREE AD SUPPORTED STREAMING TELEVISION. FAST. 

Fast is free tv paid for by ads. It’s basically the internet’s version of a 2005 cable box from Comcast. 

You have so much old content that can still generated revenue. Look at the recent Netflix VIAC deal
For narcos on Pluto or look at the library content they have. 

I am trying my best but it’s hard to break through the loud voices of GME right now. 

I would hate to see y’all miss this boat, it’s finally becoming safe enough for me to want to mention it. The turnaround is finally underway for real and we are still at the beginning. 

The Investor day is 2-24-2021 and that’s the big trade right there. 

I’m about to buy more options for 3-19 45c 50c 52.5c as well as leaps and some equity. Almost all in over 20k at risk. 

This is your moment to break the shackles of your losses. If you are sick because you missed GME or TSLA or any other big profitable moves this is your chance. 

I can’t help but feel like no one is gonna pay any attention until it’s too late to buy but y’all can’t say I didn’t try and raise the alarm. 

All traders need to pay attention and look for new ideas. Not just OTM calls on TSLA and GME. 

I am using OTM calls for this as well but it’s much safer with ITM calls.

**DD:**

ViacomCBS(🚀🚀) is a media & entertainment company. They own **CBS, Showtime, Paramount, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, & a few others.** So they own a shit load of content.

To deliver this content, they have:

*Pluto TV*

* free streaming service that's been growing at a crazy pace. 
* No subscriber revenue, but lots of ad revenue.
*  Motley fool - "*While PlutoTV reached $1 million in daily advertising sales in 2019, it has already achieved its first $3 million day this year. Furthermore, ViacomCBS markets its paid products -- CBS All Access and SHOWTIME -- to Pluto customers. Based on rapid subscriber growth on the paid side, that seems to be working well. "*
* This service is underrated. It allows companies to generate ad revenue from their old content.

*CBS All Access*

* soon to be rebranded as Paramount+. 
* Main focus of investor day.  
* Huge catalog with access to live tv and sports.
* Motley Fool - *" In Viacom's most recent quarter, it was its streaming business that stood out. Revenues for the segment grew to $636 million year over year, representing 56% growth. Its domestic subscribers jumped to 17.9 million, which prompted CEO Bob Bakish to raise his company's year-end subscriber target for the second straight quarter. "*

*Showtime*

* This is their premium content service

VIAC is a huge netflix competitor with free content, live TV & sports, and a huuuuge content library of popular titles. 

&#x200B;

Here's the kicker. VIAC market cap: 27b. Netflix market cap: 256b.

There is huge potential here because VIAC is not being treated as a streaming service but rather a content creator like fox or mgm.

Looks like we can have another good day for our **CALLaway ($ELY)** as we hold the gains from yesterday thanks to you retards. As is tradition, **we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion and growing at ridiculous levels! 🚀**

I am now on part 6 here, and our train is rolling, so I will keep up with the DD by featuring more DD by you never-look-you-in-the-eye fucks.

First, u/trap_zack mentioned:

>**ELY** **pt raise from $30 to $40, reit Buy @ JEFF -** US rounds played have continued to accelerate through the back half of '20, and we expect robust demand for the sport will continue for the foreseeable future as consumers' leisure time and spend face lessened competition. Recall, key to this strength in golf participation has been a surge in beginner play, of which the benefit to equipment sales likely extends over the medium-term as these new players invest in the game over time.

u/Throwerofrock mentioned:

>Callaway buys back old sets of clubs from their customers, gives them a credit towards new sets of clubs, and sends/sells the old clubs to be used at TopGolf. This is quite literally the best business model I can imagine. I've been playing it like an idiot since it dipped, now I'm in for shares. Fuck it.

u/MisterSlippers did some personal investigation:

>I have a golf course in my back yard, I see at least 8 dudes golfing outside right now, if you figure 12 callaway clubs per bag 8 \* 12 = 96 EOM.

Thank you for sticking with me through 6 parts. Tell your friends. Tell your parents. Tell your wives/girlfriend’s boyfriends. Buy stock. Buy options. Buy on margin.

It develops and manufactures automatic gearboxes for commercial vehicles. A sector in which little investment was made in the past year. However, this tide will turn, as the economy will most likely grow back from 2021. In a growing economy, the demand for transport is increasing and so investments are made in new commercial vehicles. The largest segment for this manufacturer is road vehicles in North America. The market share is up to 84%. So almost a monopoly...

When more new vehicles are ordered, this company will immediately benefit. In addition, the company sees extra growth opportunities in the coming years:

* New partnerships have been entered into for the vehicles in Class 4-5. Here the market share is still "only" 16%, so there is still plenty of room for growth.
* New trucks from Chevrolet, Navistar and Isuzu will only be delivered with gearboxes of this brand;
* A new Mack series will be launched soon, a truck of Class 6-7. This too is only available with this company's gearbox;
* The market for 'First and last mile transport' is growing due to the explosive growth of online retail. This means more commercial vehicles are needed to deliver all parcels;
* Margins are always under pressure in the transport sector. As a result, there is a constant demand for better products. Management responds to this by developing gearboxes that last longer with less maintenance, and that ensure lower fuel consumption.

**Other opportunities**

Outside of this classic market with growth opportunities, there are other reasons why this stock has potential to grow:

* Internationally, the share of automatic gearboxes in commercial vehicles is still extremely low.
* This company is ready for the future, as it also produces products for hybrid and fully electric commercial vehicles.
* The trend towards electric vehicles is not a threat, but an opportunity.

http://imgur.com/gallery/VmXCj9l_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR FULL DD 🚀🚀🚀[including Demo 1/26/20 (Huge Catalyst🚀) ] This post is going to be outlining the incoming demo day for Palantir.  It is potentially going to be the single biggest event for the stock since inception.  I'm also going to shed light on how PLTR can aid in vaccine distribution (AKA a fatty contract with Uncle Sam).  Without further or due retards, here is what that demo will entail and the optics for how that will affect Palantir's price. (Hint for all the retards that can't read🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀).

What does Palantir do? Palantir is a software company that allows big corporations and governments to consolidate data into one interface and create analysis on that data.  To go more in depth, a company has incredible amounts of information and that number becomes unnavigable by an employee ass time goes on.  This is where Palantir comes in, they source data from files, emails, license plate data, weather reports, Really the possibilities for input are endless and addressed when the software is tailored to a corporation.  With that data it searches for connections and can draw incredible conclusions based on that data.  This is the chance to invest in some big brother tier tech shit at an insanely discounted rate, because BABY WE'RE going LONG🚀🚀🚀🚀.  To emphasize how widespread the applications are here are examples.

Gotham was used during hurricane Florence to compound flood and active weather data to show the most at risk locations so they could rescue those first.  (precedent for being used in disasters)🚀🚀

It is used in counter terrorism to create risk analysis for an individual.  Say that individual recently quit his job, purchased questionable materials from a hardware store and is making a trip to a country where he has no connections.  That is how easy it is for Palantir to prevent terrorism based on information that is automatically entered into he system.  There is also speculation that Palantir tech helped find Osama Bin Laden and the CEO can't comment (sounds classified) 🚀🚀🚀

Conclusion: TAKE MY MONEY PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now onto the Demo day \[1-26-21 (4:30 ET)\] AKA "Liftoff"🚀🚀🚀

Intro: Shyam Sankar 

Foundry:Bianca Rahill, John DiFulvio 

Gotham Demo: Doug Philippone (head of development), Andy Elder, and Martin Manville

 Also discuss NEW product Titan 

Apollo Demo: Clark Minor, Ali Mondro

🚀🚀🚀

This is Palantir's annual demo. Why is that important you might ask or worthy of being a catalyst for PLTR?🚀🚀🚀🚀

2 Reasons:

1. They are releasing Titan.  It is a direct upgrade of Gotham based on 10 years of learning.  Titan is going to be more "performant, open and proactive".  PAUSE: Look carefully at those words, performant and proactive...  Based on that and the fact that the Chief Operating Officer called it a "force multiplier", I am speculating that Titan will include a stronger AI integration.  If this is true Titan will be an exponentially more efficient system that requires less user input for final analysis.  Why is this important?  Palantir gives a lot of contracts that expire but leave the user with the old version of the software even if not renewed.  If Titan is such a pivotal upgrade of less user input (AI integration) and Greater magnitude (hence "open")  it will be a necessary upgrade and spur a new round of contracts.  And based on Palantir's fundamentals, startup costs for new programs like Titan are higher than renewals, so this means                            
  TENDIES ALL AROUND🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.
2. Currently there is a certain element of unknown associated with Palantir and what exactly it does.  The only demo we have is from a much older platform and doesn't show all the features to the public.  I think a huge barrier to the excitement we have to this stock is that we have done our research and know what Palantir does.  As soon as this is exposed to the public it will be a game changer for the amount of attention Palantir is getting and thereafter the demand for Palantir shares.  This stock is not on most peoples radar because they do not interact with it as they do other brands.  The demo will be a blow to this aspect and increase interest from investors and demand from customers eager to upgrade to the new technology.  It is also going to give this company the traction it needs to MOON and finally retain those day gains.🚀🚀🚀

If that wasn't enough for you Retards, there's MORE! 

We are now post inauguration of President Joe Biden.  He is eager to prove that he will handle the pandemic better than Trump did (And has already signed a number of Executive Orders pertaining to Covid-19 policy).  The single best way for Biden to make this happen is quick vaccine distribution.  Here is where PLTR comes in, Alexander Carp, CEO, recently interviewed with the Washington Post describing how Palantir can be used to distribute vaccine doses to maximum efficiency and to optimize limiting the spread of Covid-19.  Earlier this year it signed a contract(25M) with the Department of Human and Health Services to analyze Covid-19 data and give a path to the most effective vaccine distribution, this program was called Tiberius.  If the Biden administration can make quick work of this vaccine distribution and make the US a model, it will bring Tiberius to the forefront.  This will open the opportunity to license it other governments and also large healthcare companies such as chain doctors offices, nursing homes etc. to distribute their share of vaccines most effectively internally.   

When this happens PLTR will Fucking Print🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

This is an incredibly understated value, we have a compelling shared interest with the brand new president.  The value that this has for the stock long is incredible.  It will put PLTR to the front of the line for contract renewals as a trusted agency that acted as a saving grace to the administration in the first of its 4 YEARS.  This on top of the fact that they have little competition to begin with means we will be looking through our telescopes to find the shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If nothing else, our beloved Cathie Woods (everything she touches basically moons) just stocked up on a JUICY 498,000 Shares for her \[ARKK\] ETF🚀🚀🚀.

Position/ 80 shares \~$25

TLDR: Next Gen software catches bad guys and can also be used by businesses.  In bed with uncle Sam and Biden will keep it that way (Tiberius).  Demo will increase demand on both sides and trigger new contracts so we can sit back and watch this baby PRINT🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The NEW "Ali vs Foreman" of the Financial World. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding Palantir - Retards Edition Listen up you retards, I know that some of you can barely read, so I simplified [a recent analysis I wrote on Palantir](https://www.financetldr.com/posts/palantir-buysellhold-onepager).

**POSITIONS?**

JUST LOADED UP ON $10K OF PLTR. We're going to the fooking moon.

**WHAT IS PALANTIR?**

Palantir is a SaaS (software as a service) company that provides governments and companies with advanced data analysis tools. In other words, Palantir gets paid to help organizations understand their disparate data in novel and valuable ways.

Palantir has three main products:

* Gotham: One of Palantir's earliest products used primarily by governments to perform general purpose data analyses on a broad data set (e.g. geospatial and statistical analysis). Gotham is very useful in discovering bad actors in a system.
* Foundry: A newer product targeted at businesses to help make forward-looking business decisions. Foundry is designed for ease of use by a large team of data analysts working on the same data sets, as is commonly found in companies.
* Apollo: A world-class continuous deployment system, Apollo allows Palantir to rapidly deploy upgrades to their software whether it's hosted in in-house data centers or in their customers's data centers.

**WHY PALANTIR?**

* SOLID GROWTH: Average revenue per customer grew at an annual rate of 30% since 2009 and contribution margins (margins per product) improved by 4x since 2019. In addition, top line revenue grew by 24.7% in 2019 and is expected to grow by more than 40% in 2020 due to COVID.
* SIGNIFICANT EARLY INVESTMENT, CLOSE TO PROFITABLE: bears say "NoT pRoFiTaBlE In 17 yEaRs". Bulls know this is actually bullish. Big investment = big rewards and Palantir's three flagship products are paying off now
* WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo are state-of-the-art technology. Just watch some of their tech talks and investor presentations. Truly impressive.
* LACK OF COMPETITION: Peter Thiel thinks that competitions are for losers. Do you know what else is for losers? Being a PLTR bear. But also, PLTR has no competition. No other company is able to do broad data analysis from random data sources like they can. No other company is willing to work w/ government like PLTR is willing to.
* LEGAL PRECEDENCE: PLTR literally sued the Army for not using them, and WON.
* SKYWISE CASE STUDY: worked with Airbus to increase A350 production rate by 33%. Now they created an open data platform called Skywise that more than 100 airlines are using.

**BUT WATCH OUT FOR...**

* LOCK-UP PERIOD EXPIRY: after the first earnings call in 2021, about 1.4B new shares should hit the market. So far there're only 244 million shares on the market. That's a bigly increase to float. But I don't expect a lot more extra selling. The insiders are probably just as or more bullish about PLTR.
* BIG CONTRACT RISK: PLTR's $1B revenue consists of several large contracts, like one that is $300 million. Losing a big contract is no bueno._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Largest stock holder of FIZZ: Renaissance Technologies (AKA Jim Simons) I've been long FIZZ for about a week (via the Feb '21 $110 calls) and the position has been performing great up 420% as of yesterday (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1y3g9/1k_into_5k_420_fizz_gain_update_21121/)). 

I'm basically in it anticipating a short squeeze - short interest is at 63% with 26 days to cover, and the stock is running up massively and is resilient af.

Today I realised that the largest stockholder is none other than Renaissance Technologies (aka Jim Simons), the billion dollar hedge fund known for using unique quant models to generate 66% returns per year!

As we now, Biden is now in office and stocks rallied yesterday as he came into the office, but fuck we all should have saw that coming with how the media treats him, people get that warm feeling and get more confident thus the market goes up. that shit is elementary. Anyways, here are the top 3 stocks Im watching today (along with most of you retards).

BB - Moon ball soon. BB has start to get the attention of this subreddit the past couple of days, and we know what happens to stocks when they get our attention, they go up. In all seriousness though they own a ton of patents in the EV car space, only about 20-30% of EV cars are out on the market, I really don't even comprehend how big of a market this could be in 5-10 years (or sooner) with how tech keeps advancing. Im super long on this shit like most.

GME - Is there much to say? Short squeeze is coming and this is taking the fuck off. End of story. WSB owns this stock and if you need more on this, literally read the subreddit, Im not going to post anything different than anyone else has, long on GME.

GOLD - this one is dumb, but over the next 4 years I think it will be a nice return (it may not be retarded but you should make money). Biden is going to print a hella lot of money, possibly remove student loan debts, the dollar is going to be worthless the more shit he does, gold with be KING. Janet already said she will curtail the B word needs to be destroyed and we saw that tank yesterday. GOLD will be king again .

The issue here is that the creation of a single identity will be our destruction. There's people framing us as if we prop up stocks, or are attempting to (as if we make gains?). They're exploiting our collective strength and we're playing right into it. I heard He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named saying that we are going to "attack" Citron with a planned surge of purchasing right after their livestream.

While this is fun to think about, and it's amazing we can go against the best, they're just setting us up to get taken down. I don't want WSB to be seen as an organized entity, which we really aren't. We need to stay loose like my wife after my mom's boyfriend is done with her. I'm worried that the spotlight we're getting with the strength we've developed will really just be the end of something amazing.

SO what can we do?

STOP saying stupid shit.

STOP acting as if we actually affect the market.

Enjoy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | GM, NetFlix [NFLX], Alibaba [BABA] & Other Stock Market News [01-21] **Stocks rally as Biden and the Dems take the helm of the US. Netflix crushes earnings while Jack Ma finally appears. General Motors partners with Microsoft to develop their self-driving tech. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last 2 days, as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/bR7cJ13) gaining over 1.5%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/fXZYKRS) rising by .81% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/yhDLD82) Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kJPWrR3) dropped over 4.5%.

Over 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/BT7vfL0) were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/M7wNJ2Q) finished in the green with Energy, Communications & Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard, as growth companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/zbgJRWC) with small-caps gaining more than 1%, while Large-Cap Value was the biggest underperformer.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/Dbb47Jn) is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday, as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google, Facebook & Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3% while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector.

Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/s3D1kvZ) lead the way, up almost 2%, while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9hV9fhV) gained 1.36% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/5B3r1D5) rose 257 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/P9mtRCH) dropping more than 7% after the removal of this big political event.

We didn’t see that many companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zZzFY6b), with only 57% of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/cTszSd6) finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix, while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large-Cap Growth companies [outperformed](https://ibb.co/8mVHFyx) the rest of the market, with Large-Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/LvGDryV) from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2%, as Amazon, Google & Netflix all gained more than 4% while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking & biotech sectors.

We didn’t get to much economic data in the past days, with the most interesting one being the Redbook store [sales](https://ibb.co/zPDB0pj) which improved slightly over last week, as the economic calendar was on pause, awaiting the inauguration of the new US president.

[Today](https://ibb.co/jgJ1frz) we start getting more economic data, as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED’s balance sheet. We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Netflix](https://ibb.co/54tB18g) miss the earnings/share but beating both the revenue, and especially the net adds of subscribers, which came in at 8.5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers. Netflix spiked [yesterday](https://ibb.co/B6zTrSp) more than 16% and closed at an all-time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021, as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years, which will be a great positive for shareholders. Another benefit is their pricing [power](https://ibb.co/s93DdWz) , as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1$ and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base. I really like 3 companies in this sector (Netflix, Disney & Roku) and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future, while the old TV and cinema world is dying.

We also saw [GM](https://ibb.co/hyb3GSB) rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft. This looks like a nice partnership between the two, with GM using Microsoft’s cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture, which is a subsidiary of GM. And on the other hand, this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast-track their self-driving tech while also making Microsoft, GM’s preferred public cloud partner. I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology.

[Tuesday](https://ibb.co/Q9JYY6D), we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance. This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6% since the spotting, after those speculations led to a continued sell-off in the stock as investors feared China’s Government implications around the company. Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e-commerce companies in this new world, and that is still fairly undervalued right now.

Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new [records](https://ibb.co/KF1Wy78) in Pennsylvania with over $500M in wagers in December, and is also expected to go live in Michigan on [Friday](https://ibb.co/9spwZMT). Morgan Stanley also [expects](https://ibb.co/3CSLKFT) more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected. I personally like companies like DKNG, PENN & WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near-future any of them.

We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with [Goldman](https://ibb.co/6rzBBNh) crushing earnings by almost $5 and an increase of 18% y/y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also [BEAT](https://ibb.co/Lp3dJbp) expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over $2B than expected. I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past [months](https://ibb.co/k0wTBVn) and it might only see another boost if rates go up, but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market, so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years.

And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always. Even if the market experiences a short-term pullback or correction, I believe this will be short lived. It doesn’t matter if we see tax increases or not, it doesn’t even matter who is president… You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/1QxtfSH) is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president, and both averages are way above 5% for each party, far exceeding inflation expectation for the future, so stay invested, look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets. Keep in mind that the [SP500](https://ibb.co/DKym45m) return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good, with the last 3 terms returning at least 5%. We can also see the [DOW](https://ibb.co/VDG7vyC) has returned over 10% on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms, which is way over the historical average.

Biden has had the biggest [rally](https://ibb.co/wYZKGmT) between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years, so, don’t expect huge gains like we have had since March, but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown… Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/9Z075Fy) markets seem to be pointing to another good day, after Biden’s inauguration and Janet Yellen’s latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending, while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/rf6B1Z0) are also pointing to a green open, with the DOW leading the way.

More importantly, with a population of 129 million -- roughly three times that of the populations of Canada and Uruguay combined -- Mexico will become by far the largest country in the world to have legalized the drug.

And perhaps even more important, once Mexico and Canada have *both* legalized marijuana, the United States will be bracketed by countries where the drug is legal. It will also the only member of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to have not legalized the drug... yet.

If you're wondering what happens after that, look no further than New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month mused that, with marijuana about to become legal next door in New Jersey, the only thing New York has to lose now from not legalizing weed is tax revenue.

I think you can expect the U.S. Congress to come to the same conclusion.

Been lurking for the memes, but thought I'll share my piece since I'm deep in on GME.

Let's back out and think a little bit about why there is so much short interest on GME. Boomers like everyone else are trying to capitalize on patterns they see. What is the pattern they are seeing? JCPenny and ToyRUs.

&#x200B;

Skimmed through some material on the fall of JCPenny and ToyRUs. TLDR: They fked up the transition to digital. (Hopefully, RC does not - I'm not a pet person, so I didn't know wtf CHEWY was before this, but he somehow made $3 Billion off of dog food... props)

&#x200B;

I know autists and retards are 🦍s and blindly chasing 🥜s, but hear me out here. If we really want GME to moon, we need boomer money to be convinced that GameStop is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. How do we do that is by making the case to the institutional money that GameStop is legit. It's obvious to us because people our age actually enjoy spending time, money, and effort on video games. And guess what? For Gen Z people, video games are a lifestyle. As more young people matriculate into the workforce, the growth for the industry only looks bright.

Now I'll sneak in a 🌈🐻 argument here. We know that the future of video games is likely going to be Sass (think DLC, Skins, and Subscriptions) so there may not be much of a space for a middlemen like GME. But, from what I understand GameStop already has a somewhat sizable customer base. As all profitable e-commerce companies do, it is not about selling the product to the people, it is about selling the people to the product - we'll see how they do. Honestly, from what I can tell their in prime position to make this work.

&#x200B;

But back to the point, if we really want to make a buck here, we have to convince boomer money that this is good idea. Let's be real here, only they have the capital to drive the price up significantly. If they do before the shorts are closed... well sorry Melvin, you made a bad trade. 🤑🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤑

So here's the real money making strategy - convince boomers that GME is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. Boomer money likely got screwed on those companies before so we need to make the case that GME isn't that and it's in fact a really good investment.

TLDR: 💎🖐 + 👴💰 = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

POS: 15K on Shares and Leaps

Just wanted throw my insight onto the pile here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Late night ramblings (Light F and GM dd with possible plays) Disclaimer: I am not the brightest idiot in the lot but after continuously scrolling through the EV hype and other news on Ford and GM etc. I decided to do some light dd for to get a glimpse of the future of the EV and other automotive hype and try to plan some possible plays based on what I found. 

Currently No-Positions in any automotive stonks (or much of anything other than fighting for GME at the moment)

Background: No financial background. I’m just a failing engineering student who washes dishes to gamble his way out of debt.

Rockets for the autists 🚀 🚀 🚀  

Please give me feedback (good or bad)

**1.** **Ford and GM are not Tesla, but they can be damn close**

They do not have a space division or Tunneling company to influence their stock price. They are more focused on the automotive industry. This can be good to be zeroed on making good vehicles, but all of the chips are in on their vehicles performing to expectations. A slip up like the Tesla fire can be a real threat to our short-term gains. Additionally, their CEO’s (Jim Farley and Mary Barra) don’t meme their stocks so don’t expect blessings from the lord. 

On the other hand: A ton of R&D and public rallying behind EV has already been done for them by Musk and smaller EV brands, they just have to perform well to compete. We know how much Elon wants to standardize his charging plugs for his cars and any upcoming compatibility news between brands is a 🚀

**2.** **Current supply shortages**

I’ve seen the news that Subaru had to cut its production back due to the global shortage of semiconductors. It is important to remember that not just the auto industry is going green. Look at the price of lithium stocks recently and rare earth stocks. Other industries like green energy farms (Solar, Wind, Tidal) are also popping up and need these resources.  As we are starting to break away from Covid-19 hurting business, and people start to get back to work and buy things like cars. (Ford and GM were up on quarterly earnings through Covid regardless) a greater demand for cars, more specifically EV vehicles may drive demand past supply of said vehicles. This in turns leaves a shortage and Car/EV prices to increase. How can people buy new cars if there are no new cars to buy?

On the other hand: As the shortage of supply becomes more and more apparent in the market. There will be a balancing force to restabilize. I see this as increased efforts at recycling metals, and plastics as well as new mining operations for precious metals. This is very much in line with the going green policy and some of it now even now begins to take place. Lucky for us lithium is a pretty abundant resource also so I am not worried about battery shortages. Check newest $PLL and $LAC mining agreements. 

**3.** **Industry and the market adapting in the coming years**

I know a lot of you retards aren’t in this for the long haul but this may affect you if you are in it long enough to see these cars come to fruition. This kind of goes with the last one in regards to keeping price down so people can buy. As manufactures begin to struggle to source a supply of materials, a shift in design is going to have to occur to maintain sales. I see this shift as being new smaller/lighter vehicles focused on efficiency as a majority of production but EV SUV’s and Pickups definitely still being on the menu based on the success and sentiment of Tesla’s larger vehicles and other SUVs/Pickups in general. 

On the other hand: Companies like Ford and GM don’t have to rush into an all EV lineup, they’ve been making gasoline vehicles and can/will continue to do so as the market continues to shift to EV. This still gives them a source of revenue and should keep the earnings reports positive even as supplies for EV development are scarce.  

**If I were to go in what would I do?**

One of these options.

1. I run as far away from these as possible.

2. Go for the low commit play. I would buy into the hype early. I’m broke right now because of GME yolo but I could get in like 50-60 shares unstressed. We may see a discount on 1/21 with the Tesla fire to go in on Ford for the Rivian Potential. Hold till any more news hits then scram (not pussy paper hand news like “OMG Ford is a dead brand will be back to $8 easy” I’m here for gainz).

3. Buy some calls. I’m not really fluent in options so pardon my retardation but this could be a learning experience given the potential once I do some catching up and get some more gains than just buying shares. If you do not know anything about options do not trade options. Then again this is r/wallstreetbets and I’m not your wife’s bf.

4. Actual smart investment. I’m kind of in this with GME and looking past the meme and hype train and see some actual potential for these stocks and for GM and Ford to get their shit together. Jim Farley seems promising for Ford to make a difference and anyone with half a brain cell wants to get a piece of Tesla’s EV pie. I really believe that Ford has an opportunity to transform itself from a company that makes metal dogshit into something to compete with Tesla and at the very least be worth more than $15 a share. 

Thanks for your time and stay 💎🙌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Remember when Citron Research gave $PTON a $5 Target Price for 2020? These idiots gave Peloton a $5 price target and a $1.4b market cap in 2020; the stock is now trading at $156 and a $45b market cap.

These fools are about the spew the same drivel about GME. Let's continue to make a complete mockery of these unethical imbeciles.

I’m working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.

**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it’s not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.

# How shorts manipulated GME this week

I’m going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.

Imagine you’re one of the big shorts on GME. You’ve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you’re Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).

But then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It’s a disaster.

What do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.

**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**

* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you’re short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.
* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don’t want to be the ones where all the “risky” traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.
* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don’t have access to one I can’t confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*

**2) Manipulative shorting:**

* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they’re using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.

Great, at this point, you think you’ve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they’re enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.

The US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn’t matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y8c8fhixmc61.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e07fbb6fbd0fb39a15a0429d3096760ccf0556a

You’re about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can’t short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.

So now you get more aggressive.

**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**

* Here’s what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [“Robinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.”](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that’s quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.
* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He’s just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.
* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.
   * Minutes before Citron’s tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.
      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**
      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**
      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**
      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**
      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**

[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron’s tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It’s pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)

* At 9:58 a.m. eastern (I’m on the west coast so timestamp is different), comes the tweet

https://preview.redd.it/jupelyppxmc61.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dc187be8fdd580bd418c43f682e526e5c346d1

* Note the language here:
   * Citron’s not revealing anything until tomorrow, when short sale restrictions are done. *I.e. you better not buy today!*
   * Price target of $20 **matching exactly the lowest strike price of the puts purchased just minutes prior**.
   * “I understand short interest better than you” - i.e. “the shorts are paying me and I know who they are, and why they’re shorting”
   * “Poker game” - ***he’s calling you a sucker, while at the same time tweeting a poker bluff***\*\*.\*\* He doesn’t actually have anything ready or substantial, but the shorts paid him off to threaten the market.
* Andrew Left fired his shot. Now comes the coordinated shorting.
* In about an hour, **all 1.2 million shares** in Interactive Brokers are used up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f6do9e7txmc61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=1017e67af75f3f85fc98425aa5b6154b255cd5c1

* Probably, prior to this, shorts used the invisible shares available from brokerages like Robinhood.
* Wait, shorts can’t short on restricted days, right? **Wrong.**
   * **They can short on the ask.**
   * When there’s fear in the market, organic sellers lower their ask to exit their positions.
   * Shorts high-frequency algos move their ask to match the lowest organic ask.
   * Organic seller really needs to get rid of these shares! Citron is coming! Sees he’s now not the lowest ask, so he moves it down.
   * Guess what? The algos match his ask and short at the lower price now.
   * **This cycle repeats as long as organic sellers reduce their asks to sell.**
* While all this is happening, **market makers are shorting/selling shares in response to the puts placed prior to the tweet,** helping push down the price.

Congratulations. **In a matter of less than an hour, GME has now dropped from $45 to $37/share - an 18% drop and an** ***absolutely incredible reversal of momentum.***

Citron didn’t even have to do shit. The next day they canceled their livestream claiming they *forgot about the fucking inauguration.*

# How to be smart

As you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It’s sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.

There are some things you can do to trade smarter.

* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It’s up to you to lend or not, but don’t let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:

[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)

* **Don’t advertise when you’re going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying “wait for 11:30 to buy!”. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there’d be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo’d in at 41 you’re probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.
* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**

[u\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio. Exercising the April 12 calls would not impact his PnL, would increase liquidity, and would give him the option of lending shares \(and earning money\) or not. ](https://preview.redd.it/37hwj00gymc61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bb9864aee06d5d8c379b3413da2d6a7c7071a)

* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in GME, *that it doesn’t matter what price you buy now if you have patience.* There are so many potential catalysts coming and if all of this dirty behavior is any evidence shorts are scared and looking for cheap buys to get out. **Don’t give up your shares for cheap.** Here’s a quick list of potential catalysts that could happen at any time and any of which would spell more pain for shorts:
   * Share recall for a vote on major issue
   * Cohen becomes CEO
   * Alan, Jim (chewy directors added to board) purchase shares (they are not limited in how many they can buy)
   * Cohen could buy his remaining 7%
   * New higher $ investors pile in

   * Debt upgrade
      * GME’s 2021 bond is done is March, the removal of which has many restrictive covenants

It’s a short tactic called preborrowing.

The options chain is suggesting a pretty wide move. But what I noticed monitoring the put options is that a huge amount was thrown into 30P weeklies. 

The first thing that comes to mind is that all those broker emails came out over the weekend to ask everyone to borrow shares.

My guess is that shorts have increased their positions these past few days and many of the shares are preborrowed meaning it’s a big lot of shorts that havnt hit the ticker but the shares are reported as shorted since borrow fees are being paid. If the shares are preborrowed, shorts need to execute the short sale within 4 days or the shares get returned. Assuming the accumulation of preborrowed shares started Tuesday, shorts will have until Monday or next Wednesday to use this attack without being burned by interest.

When Citron publishes the report, they will most likely time a bear attack at the same time massively shorting the preborrowed shares and hope to create a snowball effect. 


I’m not quite sure what the defense would be to counter an ambush like this. BTFD? At your own risk.



TLDR: Big timed sale of preborrowed shares will be used as attack to shake out paper hands. It takes four days for shares to be returned. Just burn the shorts on interest and never sell._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ryan Cohen was not the first bombshell $GME board member. It was former Nintendo CEO, Reggie Fils-Aime [It was Reggie Fils-Aime, the Regginator.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-reginald-fils-aime-william-simon-and-james)

This is not something I've seen in anyone's $GME DD or come up in discussion much.

Reggie is extremely well-loved by fans of Nintendo, kind of a legend, and supremely well-connected in the gaming world.

There is some speculation that $GME will try to pivot into a gaming culture powerhouse. Reggie is an absolute ace in the hole for that. The degree to which he managed to engage fans of Nintendo during his tenure as *President was incredible and revolutionary, not to mention what he has done for the brand as a whole.

The things you like about Chewy, like that customer connection? I can say with absolute confidence that Reggie and Ryan are extremely well-aligned ideologically.

[Check out this video if you don't know who he is. He's a really special guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC73X0awtpQ)[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC73X0awtpQ)

Reggie alone would be serious enough rocket fuel for me. I wish I had been a place in my life to invest in $GME when this news happened. HOLD!!!!

I've been in GME since end of Aug and already have gone through 2 agonizing battles with the shorts, the first ride up was due to the MSFT deal which gave gains of $71,857, didn't sell, went all the way down to $2,671. Second ride gave $92,378 tendies and lost it all once again due to Q3 short attack. There were tons of people telling me I should've sold....but I had DFV as an example and I trusted in all the DD that had been diligently provided. I knew the beautiful Ryan Cohen was close by to help me to stay.

As you can see in the bottom photo those peaks and troughs turned into tiny blips when you stick to your motherfucking thesis and trust that GME will give you the gainz we are all here for. Not selling until at least $420.69 - $1000 cuz fuck Melvin and Citron with their peanut allergy 🥜🥜🥜

&#x200B;

Believe me when I tell you the shorts are on the goddamn ropes:

\- They used to have roughly 50k 15p in July, sold at a loss

\- They moved those up to various strikes in January, got fucked on those

\- They spend countless dollars paying Wall Street to tell everyone how shitty owning GameStop shares are

\- They might've sucked off A. Left to play Twitter tag - couldn't even provide him with a bear thesis

Didn’t even move an inch at this news. Stocks only go up! 🚀🚀🚀

Well buckle up because we’re about to see the economy absolutely explode. Here’s why. 

While there are still an average of 3000+ people dying from covid everyday there are some interesting statistics behind the deaths that we should look at. 

Over 80% of covid deaths are in the 65+ age range. 

There are 56 million Americans in that age range (65+) 

Currently the US has given out 17.2 million doses and in the last 7 days we’ve averaged 900,000 per day. (This number was 800,000 yesterday) so we’re probably doing well over 1 mil doses per day. 


Let’s assume in the next month we’ll be able to average 1.5m doses.



That’s 1.5m x 30 = 45m 

45m + 17m (already administered) = 62m 

If 30% of those 62m goes to “frontline essential” workers and the other 70% goes to old people. We should see 43m vaccines going to the high risk population within a month. 

43/56 = 75% of the older population vaccinated 

0.75 * 0.95 ( effective rate of vaccine) = 73% 

0.73 * 0.8 ( percentage of deaths attributed to this age group) = 58% in reduced deaths in one month! 

Basically covid will be gone within a month and a half MAX.

CCL, NCLH, AAL, AHT, you name it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 138% sHoRT fLoAt! Why it's wrong (and right) to compare GameStop to Volkswagen Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  🚀 🚀 🚀

I've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.

First, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from €348 to over €1K in the single day that it squeezed.

As for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).

|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|
|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|
|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|

Outstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!

Again, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \~$120 from this scenario._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Not much but It is all I can do till my Girlfriend’s boyfriend gives me more good boy points! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Big T (Part 2) - Bring an Umbrella to this Tendie Bukkake 🚀🚀🚀 Long 2200 [$64,000] Here's the deal, shart shakes.

I have a feeling we are going to see a boom in companies generating synthetic data for training machine learning models in the near future. If you’re curious at what synthetic data is and what it is used for, read my summary below. Is anyone familiar with any companies that are public or will soon become public that are focusing on doing this kind of work? One company that I am currently looking as is AI.Reverie, but it is private and there is no telling on when/if it will go public in the future.

__SUMMARY__

Most modern machine intelligence utilizes a tool called Machine Learning. For those who aren’t familiar, Machine Learning is often used to give the computer the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience (data) without being explicitly programmed. The more data this computer has to train on, the smarter it typically gets. One popular application this is being implemented on is training a computer to detect objects or obstacles in images & video, which is called Computer Vision.

For Autonomous Vehicles to navigate the world on their own, they need to see. Many today rely on a combination of Computer Vision and LIDAR because current Computer Vision models aren’t reliable enough to be used alone. Anyone who has looked into LIDAR has probably found weary critics talk about how Elon Musk is calling it a cheat, since humans don’t have the ability to shoot lasers out of their heads to detect obstacles. Instead, he is confident there were be substantial increases in Computer Vision models and any companies who rely on LIDAR will fall behind. Some experts disagree with him, but I think he can get there if he had more/better images (data) to train Computer Vision models. 

Current data collection requires a lot of man power. Not only does something have to take or collect all of the images for model training, but they also need to have someone go through each image and label them. This is equivalent to what you do when you have to verify you’re not a robot on a website and click all of the images with busses, street signs, etc. instead of using real images, tons of money is pouring into creating synthetic images. Not only does this drastically reduce the manpower required for data collection, but it has the power to drastically improve Computer Vision model accuracy because you can get a lot more images with a lot more variety._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Update: On Citron's 5 reasons and how they might try to manipulate you tomorrow Obligatory disclaimer: I am not an expert, nor have I been doing this long.

This is a repost with updates, if this is not OK, mods go ahead and delete, I'll just edit the original.

&#x200B;

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it (including paid news articles).

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/). Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)
4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason "in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

Source: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing

1. They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's "rabid" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.
2. Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are "autists" and "retards"...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).

&#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

1. Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a "high" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**

**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**

**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).

**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.

**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).

BONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded on some days than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's three reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 20% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. **The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.**
3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these "twitter Live" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/). **Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration, as they were hoping for a higher viewership (or potential viewership), which makes perfect sense, but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID (for the good of their viewers), THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.**

None of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual, and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure. If they're very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again, they're limited in their shorting options on the next day.

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank rapidly (potentially due again to some big 1M share sells). If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell. Remember, due to puts expiring Friday, there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below $35 or as close as they can asap.

Option 3: Small but steady downward pressure, in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down.

Gamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow. This helps push stock up, and I bet they time it to be right before Citron's twitter live if they can, and my personal hope is that there's something unexpected about this influx of new consoles (perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal?), but I don't expect this to have a super huge effect.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Citron might have good points, but they'll leave out a lot. Find the real scoop above, and don't let them manipulate you into selling if they or their funders time some share dumps to go with their stream.  💎🙌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hold strong $MGNI, come ER time and this will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NIO could be at a great “buy the dip” level NIO hit a high of $67 before dropping to $54-$57 area, there is a load of supply around the $50-40 zone so its very unlikely for NIO to fall any lower.

With all the attention surrounding the new Space ETF upcoming from everyone’s favorite Cougar: Cathie Wood over at ARK, I’ve tried to research exactly who could potentially end up in this portfolio, and one company is standing out to me far above some of the other seemingly obvious big names that you would expect: Nano Dimension.

**WHAT THEY DO**

NNDM builds 3D printers that fab complex electronic components. Their Dragonfly printer can simultaneously print conductive and dielectric mediums to create things like circuit boards, semi conductors, capacitors, and lots of other tiny computer guts that makes stuff work. [Really cool shit.](https://youtu.be/LbXJ-F9PVKo)

**WHO THEY ARE**

An Israeli company, ran by Yoav Stern. He’s kinda cool for a boomer, actually. Been involved in everything from Aerospace to Security, and is now the HNIC at Nano Dimension. The company has made some big fucking moves in 2020, and they look to be set up nicely for a pivot in a new direction that will revolutionize the way people approach fabrication and manufacturing.

**WHY WE LIKE ‘EM**

Nano Dimension has put themselves in a pretty good spot to tackle the future. They’ve rolled out quite a bit of stock offerings over the past few months, but thanks to that and the enthusiasm generated around their product? They’ve successfully raised over 1 Billion dollars [straight cash, homie](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/nano-dimension-s-cash-raising-could-lead-to-some-intriguing-scenarios-15542708) while maintaining virtually zero debt. With 💰 like that on tap, you can pave a long, wide road into the future. They’ve also recently appointed this [AI genius by the name of Dr Eli David to the Board of Directors](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/20/2161517/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Appoints-Dr-Eli-David-to-the-Board-of-Directors.html) to help them gear up their manufacturing process. This dude has written a lot of words on a lot of papers about AI. He’s Wicked Smaht.

This kind of advancement will revolutionize every aspect of the tech industry. Think about it: it’s a damn sight cheaper to send a 3D printer into space and have it build all the shit you need up there, instead of having some 3rd world knuckle-dragger who’s just looking forward to his next break actually do his job and make the part, then put it on a rocket/boat/plane/whatever for weeks, just to get it to some other jerk-off who actually install’s it to complete the cycle. Hell, if you know anything at all about manufacturing, you should be salivating at the thought of how goddamn awesome it would be to not have to rely on China or Taiwan or whoever to make something you desperately need for your complicated-ass computer or robotics system to work. Let alone the time advantage and convenience of walking over to Dragonfly, slapping some keys, and POOF: part is in your hand. 

This company is undervalued as fuck if you ask me. Shit, man, the cash they have on hand alone is twice their market cap. There’s been more posts about this company popping up here, but the GME short saga and BB revolution has taken a lot of the light. (Which is great, because fuck Melvin & Hooray privacy!) Yet, I can’t help but see the potential in this company, especially with the gains they’ve made over the last 3 months or so. Words getting out. Don’t miss this one!

**Disclosures**

Just because NNDM has a shitload of cash and a good product doesn’t necessarily mean the new direction the companies going in will be successful (although it seems management has a good goal for the tech, and a sound plan on reaching it). I also can’t really find a ton of background info on neither one of these assholes I’ve named, so for fucks sake: do some digging on your own. 

NNDM should be our next big meme stock. Don’t wait. Get out ahead of this one while the gettin’s good.

I predict GME 70+ end of week _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cathie Bae helped me realise how amazing the “New Tesla” sector is! Just some info on “the next TSLA” sector and stock.

Who here loves Cathie Woods aka Cathie bae? Who here loves NVTA? I love NVTA because Cathie bae loves NVTA. 

A little insight on NVTA:

I’ve followed NvTA since $18 before Cathie bae started gobbling it up. I sold at $30 but will be getting back into it ASAP.

1. Invitae’s mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medicine to improve healthcare for billions of people.(website)

2. Genomics is set to transform our health. Cathie Bae said genomics sector is the NEXT TSLA. 

3.You will see Invitae from birth...because they do genetics testing in utero(for idiots, that means when the baby is inside mommy’s tummy) to test for defects. That’s just the start. Now...insurances are covering these tests for almost all women! Because it’s better them to catch a defect early rather than deal with the consequences later. 

4. NVTA is getting even more into genome sequencing! Everyone knows CRSP...get to know NVTA.

5. Cathie bae and ARK are the biggest shareholders at 27.3M shares accounting for 15.1% of all shares followed by BlackRock Inc, another big boy.

6. NVTA is the third biggest asset in both ARKG and ARKK. 

7. They just had a dip due to some offerings. I will be picking up many tomorrow along with calls. 

I hope this was decent insight into Invitae, NVTA

EDIT: The sources(Fidelity,TDA) on the composition of NVTA in ARKG and ARKK were not up to date. 
Thank you U/Sublime_7365  for bringing this to my attention.

I work in the private mortgage banking industry; specifically, I work with distressed debt portfolios and the utilization of Mortgage Servicing Rights as a financial hedge in mitigating credit losses. I also enjoy thinking about the wider US economy because, well, I'm autistic I guess. I am on a bunch of Adderall, and wanted to voice my rambling thoughts about a macro trend unraveling in the US housing market.

Since you, like me, are aimlessly scrolling through the vast news and information flows that rule our mind, I am going to assume you have become aware of two things.

1. With historically low rates, mortgage applications are at **decade long highs**, with lenders and processors working overtime and hiring like crazy. We're talking *massive growth* even in established lending units at large financial institutions. If you work in banking or finance, you may likewise get inundated with scores of job openings for "closers, processors, auditors, compliance" etc. in medium to large sized mortgage origination operations.
2. Due to the massive, lasting unemployment in sectors ravaged by the current COVID pandemic, there are tens of millions of American workers currently in distressed housing situations, representing billions of dollars in unpaid mortgage and rent. With federal moratoriums in place, many debtors are protected by current orders from both foreclosures and evictions. Millions of American homeowners have required prolonged payment deferments in order to prevent their mortgage from going in to default.

If you are not interested in reading a massive ramble about my thoughts on these two contrasting points, I'd advise backing out now.

Topic 1 is fascinating in itself, and I would be happy to put together another post delving further into things like rates, the effect on asset prices, etc. if there is demand. However I want to focus on one key thing: The increased volume of mortgage applications, combined with a lack of new supply in the housing market, is leading to **extremely high asset prices, and thus much larger mortgages.** This may seem all too familiar.

However, my focus is on *distressed* debt, or credit, depending on how you look at it. The number of loans that are over 90 days delinquent on their mortgage payments has been rising rapidly over the past several months, as extended unemployment leaves unprotected borrowers further and further behind. Currently, in one portfolio, the average borrower in a 90+ day default had arrearage of over $5,500.00. When the COVID pandemic first struck the economy, the US government instituted a policy that all of it's Government Sponsored Entities would offer up to a 12 month payment deferment to debtors. This policy did **not apply to private mortgages,** and while many private lenders did institute their own deferment policies for a period, they have somewhat slowly begun proceeding legally on defaulted loans again in recent months. Biden has just extended this moratorium through September of 2021.

When a borrower defaults on a mortgage, the lender's only recourse to re-coup their credit loss is to execute a foreclosure on the property, allowing the lender to take possession of the home and resell the asset - using the proceeds of the sale to cover the losses incurred on the mortgage. Executing a foreclosure takes substantial time and money, even a completely uncontested foreclosure can take up to a year, and cost say $5,000.00 in attorney fees alone - with the moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions in place, lenders have no way to take possession of their assets and resell them on them market, costing even more time and money. However, there is nothing stopping lenders from doing *everything but foreclosing/evicting* in the judicial process, with just the final step of eviction being blocked. Because of this, the US has a HUGE number of cases piling up where as **soon** as the courts say "Go" - we will see a torrent of evictions being filed, likely hundreds of thousands, as banks move to take possession of homes that are severely defaulted.

Theoretically, the flood of new inventory on the housing market, with potentially millions of more foreclosures and rental units/apartments coming on the market once evictions resume as well - should serve to b**ring down the relative cost of housing** in those markets to a proportionate degree. In reality, the only areas that have **truly** high rates of default and significant foreclosure action, are already struggling areas dominated by industries flipped upside down by COVID. Counties where families are earning less than the state's average, where low wage, service based jobs dominate, entire towns that are reliant on single sectors like energy.. These individuals do not all live in houses that have benefitted from the rising tide of asset prices, or else they would have **already** refinanced, or sold, to cure the default. There are millions of Americans currently facing this reality, and the reality of several million homeless, desperate, Americans see each day is that **housing prices are at an all time high, the stock market is soaring, people are so comfortably wealthy that Peloton can become a thing.** I believe that if we do not do something NOW to address the root cause of what is truly a disgusting problem, we are going to see a massive decrease in the quality of life in America, massive unnecessary suffering, and cause untold problems for the future of our country. We could see a literal peasant revolt.

The only question now, is what will the coming months look like? Will we see a progressive revolution in the mortgage financing industry, with sweeping new regulatory changes and massive homeowner relief programs? Or will we see inaction and untold hardship? Do massive financial losses come either way? I have no idea of the answer to any of these questions, though I do have my thoughts. I'm curious to hear yours.

TLDR: PPL are fucked.

Some things I would like to mention is that 2020 recovery gains were also assisted by stimulus checks but we know those won't keep coming in forever. So my guess is that we will have a correction probably late 2021. We will see how wrong I am in a few months.

I’m dying over here. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let’s do this. BB to the moon 🚀 🌙 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ While we wait for Short Interest Info My initial post wasn't showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words. I wanted to write some points toward why GME is going to fly to the moon regardless of the short squeeze. If you're not a gamer then maybe this will provide some insight. 

Gamestop has been moving away from physical sales in a big way and I believe there are a few things happening in the gaming industry that Ryan Cohen sees as priceless. 

**My overall point: Ryan Cohen isn't buying Gamestop to just drive E-Commerce. RC wants to turn Gamestop into the most beloved Gaming Culture company on the planet.** 

Gaming is a huge industry. As a matter of fact, it's the largest entertainment industry in the world. 180 Billion tendies big and it's growing at such a fast rate it's expected to almost double by 2025. Gamestop is already positioned as one of the most recognizable gaming brands but they are known for not having quality customer service. RC has spoken a lot about how Customer Service and brand loyalty is his primary focus. If he can accomplish this, Gamestop will not have competition in the gaming industry in 5 years. I'm going to make the following points succinct.

1) MSFT and GME have a deal for revenue share. It is reported that Gamestop also has something similar with Sony.

2) Scalpers have ruined new console and PC parts sales for everyone. Inventory shortages are a real problem and Gamestops partnerships are a big part of solving this. here's why: I believe that Gamestop is organizing deals that not only revenue share, but also give them inventory priority. Want to buy the new Xbox? Go to Gamestop. Want to buy the new AMDs? Go to Gamestop.

3) PC Build a Centers - This concept supports my statement in number 2. If Gamestop has a build a PC center arrangement, I would bet my money (and I quite literally have) that Gamestop is arranging inventory priority on the new chipsets and GPUs. It would not surprise me to see GME make deals with Intel and/or AMD to make this happen.

4) Culture - ESports and Streaming are a huge hit. There are 140 Million unique visitors to Twitch on a monthly basis. They have arenas dedicated to ESports that get SOLD OUT. Imagine Gamestop hosting (successfully) local tournaments at their newly refreshed centers. Gamers will recognize Gamestop as an ally to the culture, not just a retailer. 

5) Subscriptions - Here's where the MSFT deal is bigger than I think it's being talked about. MSFT did something interesting with their next-gen consoles. They had a deal where you paid 24.99 a month for 2 years for the new console and got a Gamepass subscription included. 

6) Gamestop has talked about creating a digital trade-in platform Which would be huge in the gaming industry. I personally own at least 2K worth of digital games I haven't played in years and can't get rid of. 

Combine all of my points and I believe RC is looking to partner Gamestop's Power Up Rewards with MSFT Gamepass, along with some form of digital trade-in platform. Subscriptions are profitable.  Gamestop and MSFT partnership is fucking massive. Imagine Gamestop's ECommerce platform being the main medium that Microsoft uses for game purchases and trade-ins. PC game sales through MSFT store, Xbox store, all run on Gamestops platform. They Rev share all digital purchases and trade-ins and MSFT uses Gamestops physical locations to push their PC sales. 

Sorry for the wall of text but this where my head at. I'm a fucking nerd I get it but Gamestop is known by every single gamer. If they can position themselves as part of the culture and not a blood-sucking retailer, it's game over for the competition. 

I believe Ryan Cohen can accomplish this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀 🚀 🚀 bless your soul 🚀 🚀 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ford 🚀 2000 June 18 21 10c _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Used the FD to destroy the FD still holding my GME Shares 🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB to the moon 🚀🚀 75,000 shares YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSJ oped on SPACs _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It’s not much, but it’s honest work. 1 week gains on $EH. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB: Lottery ticket pays off $75 -> $2500 So I was reading the DD for BB back in Dec and decided to buy.

He currently drives a 2008 Ford Five Hundred with 280K miles on it. For comparison, I drive a Model 3 and don't make as much as him.

He agreed to the following: I instruct him how to invest $10K and if I can grow it to $45K, he'll buy the Model Y.

Position thesis:

$STPK (Stem Inc): They are incredibly undervalued at $1.3B. Tesla's valuation is significantly dependent on them "not being a car company." This points to their energy storage business which most analysts have projected would account for half of their revenue in the future. Energy storage is a $1.2T industry and Stem is the current market leader (ahead of Tesla!). Their Athena software controls how that energy is used based on demand charges/variable electric rate/renewable generation/ect. This SaaS allows the owner to improve their ROI. Citron price target of $100 puts their market cap at around $15B which is incredibly conservative. Considering their 348% growth target this year BEFORE Biden's clean energy plans-this stock is set to explode.

$GOEV (Canoo): There was just a fair market analysis done that suggests their business is worth over $26/share. That's before any Lyft or Apple agreements which we should learn about by March. There seems to be a lot of discussion/confusion around Hyundai's E-GMP skateboard design. The E-GMP platform has been co-developed with Canoo using their IP. Canoo should get mentioned when Hyundai/Kia begin announcing their new EVs built on this new modular skateboard EV platform. A Apple/Hyundai agreement on an EV would certainly benefit Canoo. They were seeking an investment in early 2020 from Apple and instead, Apple wanted to discuss an acquisition. Canoo turned them down and went public instead which shows their tech is legit.

https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-begins-major-5g-spectrum-auction

The FCC gave the dick to Intelsat and jacked their spectrum allocation called the C-Band and is now auctioning it off to telecom companies. Now, I know when I say spectrum and C-Band you think I’m talking about what you are on and your grades in community college but stay with me. The C-Band is the best spectrum for telecos because it’s faster then lower frequency 4G spectrums, with an up to 1.5 gig potential download speed, but can still penetrate objects, unlike higher frequency spectrum bands and your micropeen.

The telcos are bidding like fuck on this either because they are so far behind on spectrum ownership (VZ, T) or because they want to fuck over the other guys (TMUS). At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter because this auction is literally dropping another T-Mobile of spectrum capacity into the laps of the telcos.

So what do you retards thing is going to happen after the auction? After touching tips with their bankers for more loans, the telcos are going on a capex binge to build out their networks with 5G-enabled equipment. And who do you think they’re going to buy it from, Huawei?

TLDR: The FCC gave the telcos $80 billion of autism and now they they want to buy new toys. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Lately i've been pretty busy with gme and i haven't been able to follow the upcoming bb hype. I've been trying to find what caused the sudden hype but i can't seem to find it really.

 I know that they've pivoted away from phones to software for self driving cars, but i assume this has been known for quite a while. I also know they settled a suit with FB, but i wouldn't expect something like that to trigger this much hype. So why the sudden change in popularity? And what is the bull case for it that suddenly made the stock such a compelling choice to invest in?
