 Any updates China and the US have been publicly feuding for quite a while now and due to this tensions have been high and governments have taken action. I'm British so It doesn't affect me that much but recently the  US government are expanding a list of companies prohibited from receiving U.S  investments. This means companies like NIO, [JD.com](https://JD.com) inc, Alibaba and [Pinduoduo Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PDD:US) might be removed from the NASDAQ. This effects me because I've invested over ¬£10000 into JD. 

Does anybody have any updates on the situation ( here's some extra info) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/china-adrs-sink-after-report-u-s-eyeing-alibaba-tencent-bans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/china-adrs-sink-after-report-u-s-eyeing-alibaba-tencent-bans)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lumen $LUMN is the next Michael Burry play if you missed $GME In Q3 2020, Michael Burry of The Big Short fame who also famously began investing in Gamestop around $4/share, purchased 900,000 shares of Lumen, formerly Centurylink.

During that time, the stock roughly traded between $9 and $11/share. It dropped below $9/share shortly thereafter in October 2020.

Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.

[https://twitter.com/BannerView/status/1336324830929375234](https://twitter.com/BannerView/status/1336324830929375234)

This is a value play very much along the lines of Gamestop. Lumen is currently reducing debt by using positive cash flow and focusing the business on new opportunities in a bid to turnaround revenue growth.

If you missed the huge run-up in Gamestop, $LUMN is still sitting at the ground level. Burry is typically early to his plays as it took quite a bit of time for the Gamestop play to work. Also, his short on $TSLA has been brutal for his portfolio so there is certainly risk to this particular play. However, the strong cash flow, large dividend and craziness of this market to accelerate momentum certainly makes $LUMN a low risk, yet high reward opportunity.

We hold calls. Specifically, the April 12C is our most attractive holding.

Hello everyone! I don‚Äôt know about you, but I love to make plays on company earnings. There‚Äôs nothing more exciting than eagerly waiting for that earnings call to come after you‚Äôve locked in your position. I wanted a more quantitative approach to these plays. I made a machine learning model to assist in predicting whether or not a company would beat earnings. I present to you a personal project of mine: EarningsBot.

**How does it work?**

EarningsBot is trained to predict whether a company will beat consensus earnings estimates for the upcoming earnings report. The training data consists of features extracted from the previous 10Q statements like debt, cash, funds from operations, etc. The model is attempting to answer questions like ‚ÄúWill a company‚Äôs debt in Q3 impact if said company will beat earnings in Q4‚Äù? 

I will be making updates to the website every Thursday, so stay tuned!

**How accurate is the model?**

The model has an accuracy of 65.8% on the test data set (data the model has not seen before). 

**What algorithm are you using?**

I‚Äôm using a decision tree model (XGBoost). 

**What are some important features the model is learning?**

Some features the model learned to pay close attention to:

* Funds from operations
* Global Industry Classification
* Account payable/Creditors

**How many data samples are you using?**

I have data from 2008-2020 with a little more than 90,000 earnings reports from 8,725 companies. I‚Äôm using 2,541 features.

**Don‚Äôt companies already have a natural tendency to beat earnings?**

Yes, companies will beat earnings at a rate of 57%. However, we are still above chance!

**What‚Äôs the point??? A stock can still go down even if they beat earnings!** 

Yes this is definitely possible, especially if there is negative news in the earnings report. However, I calculated the percent change in stock price before and after earnings for companies that beat and companies that missed earnings from 2008-2020. The average percent change in price after earnings announcements for companies that beat earnings is 1.6%. The average percent change in price for companies that miss earnings is -1.8%. So take that to the bank!

**This is pretty vague, you got any source code?**

I plan to have a proper write up on arXiv when I‚Äôm a bit less busy, and potentially some source code.

**How can I make money off of this?**

This is for research purposes only so don‚Äôt use it as financial advice üòâ. I take the companies that the model predicts as ‚Äúwill beat earnings‚Äù and split up $1000 as shares among them a couple days before earnings. Then after earnings, I dump everything and repeat. Check out the website for some of my recent plays!

Recently I've been noticing the government passes laws that encourage people to invest in the markets.

 \* 401k/403b and Roth/Traditional IRA's

\* Allowing you to net your losses against your gains AND also taking up to $3k per year in extra losses, for an indefinite amount of time (if you have big losses)

\* The Tax Reform Act did NOT get rid of margin interest deduction, which incentivizes people to borrow on margin, as they can deduct the interest on their taxes

\* The government passed Regulation T to allow people to borrow on margin, but at a 2:1 ratio.  So if you have $5k, you can buy a maximum of $10k.  Not long before the Great Recession, investors with over $100k were allowed "Portfolio Margin" which allows them a maximum of 6.6:1.  So if you have $100k, you can invest a maximum of $660k.

\* The government has been sending out stimulus checks, which have really been greasing the markets to go higher.

\* The government has been printing $120 billion per month and throwing it at the economy, which ultimately helps to grease the markets higher.

This could be your next 2x play over the next couple of years. Apps are everywhere these days. Apple's App Store and Google‚Äôs Play Store combined to have close to 5 million apps. Literally, more businesses than ever before incorporate mobile apps into their platforms and the trends will likely continue post-pandemic as we are approaching Digital America 2.0.

Appian is a leader in creating a low-code process for creating apps, meaning that users don't need to know how to write code to build their apps. Creating an easier way to build apps has been a smashing success for Appian, and in the most recent quarter, the company's cloud subscription sales increased by 40%. And management estimates that full-year 2020 cloud subscription revenue will pop 34% year over year.

The mobile app market was worth $106 billion in 2018 and will reach an estimated $407 billion by 2026, according to an Allied Market Research study. There aren't enough developers around to make all of the apps that companies need these days, and trust me a lot will turn to Appian as a leader in low code to do it for them.

In fact, a lot of them already have.

I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn't cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn't. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark.

If anyone is still reading this, I know what you're thinking: "Wow, 100 bucks, big deal," and you're right. It's not much. However, If an average guy like myself can battle back and grow his account 10% (+30% in two months), I strongly believe that anyone can; with enough dedication. I'd be happy to talk more about my journey to anyone who's interested or just starting out.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments! I‚Äôve been reading almost every one! I knew a lot of people would say that based on my story, trading probably isn't for me, you have a very valid reason for saying so, and you could still be right. I've heard that everyone's trading journey is different, and I'm hoping my journey can continue for much longer. Instead of thinking about how I've only made 10% in 8 months in one of the strongest bull runs, I like to think that I've gone from $850 to $1100 (30% gain) while the SPY has gone up 8% in the past two months.  I hope these type of gains can continue, but time will tell. Even if I can't continue these gains, I've really enjoyed the learning process and think that the knowledge I've gained is beneficial and worth the time to me.

A bit of a background: I'm a 27 year old, with a job that provides for my daily income. I recently "woke up" to realize that I need to invest the money that's just sitting idle in my bank account, especially since I do not need that much cash right now. So, I decided to invest some of my existing savings in the stock market for the **long term** (buy-and-hold, I'm in no hurry to make gains). This was my **first ever investment**, so I am quite the newbie. I'm hoping to invest a total of around $40,000-$50,000 this year.

Now, a few days ago, I bought stocks worth a total of around **$25,000**, largely in ETFs, **all together**. These are the investments:

1. MSFT: $4k (at around $214)
2. VGT: $4k (at around $353)
3. QQQ: $4k (at around $314)
4. ARKK: $3k (at around $139)
5. ARKF: $3k (at around $51)
6. PBW: $3k (at around $123)
7. ARKG: $2k (at around $106)
8. ICLN: $2k (at around $126)

I'm now having some second thoughts, and would be grateful to have some of your more qualified opinions on the same:

* Did I make a mistake by investing $25k altogether? I didn't know about DCA (dollar cost averaging) until after I finished buying (sounds stupid, and it is). The reason I'm nervous is because there are opinions that suggest the market is at an all-time high & will pullback massively soon. OTOH, my portfolio looks "balanced" & low-risk, but again, I'm not sure. To reiterate, I don't need the $25k cash & am perfectly okay with investing it altogether, *if* the investments make sense.
* If this is a mistake, how can I fix it? Should I just sell off half my holdings, evenly across the board, and then DCA for the rest of the year?
* Or, should I keep the safer bets (MSFT, QQQ, VGT) and sell off just the riskier ones (ARK, PBW, ICLN)?
* Alternatively, should I just hold on, given that I'm here for the long-term?

The Model Y is "engineered to distribute crash forces around the cabin and away from vehicle occupants, greatly reducing the risk of injury," according to the automaker.

Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD & TSM suffer. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news!**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.

Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small & mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn‚Äôt even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED‚Äôs Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won‚Äôt raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD & others, but I think this is more of a ‚Äúhype move‚Äù right now. Intel has still fallen behind it‚Äôs competition and it will take massive Capex and R&D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.

We also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.

We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¬æ of the US population.

Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.

While in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.

We also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu & Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China‚Äôs state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the ‚Äúbig players‚Äù who get in at much lower prices.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.

"Promising and improving overall trend in OS in total population (based on approx. 60% of events): median survival benefit of +2.7 months from efti plus chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy plus placebo Statistically significant OS benefit in efti group observed in pre-defined patient groups: +7.1 months survival benefit (median of 21.9 vs. 14.8 months, nearly 50% longer) from efti with chemotherapy for patients under 65 years of age +9.4 months survival benefit (median of 22.4 vs. 12.9 months, 74% longer) from efti with chemotherapy for patients with a low starting monocyte count Statistically significant increase in CD8 T cells in patients treated with efti plus chemotherapy, correlated with prolonged OS, indicating pharmacodynamic activity and proof of concept of efti's mode of actionPromising and improving overall trend in OS in total population (based on approx. 60% of events): median survival benefit of +2.7 months from efti plus chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy plus placebo Statistically significant OS benefit in efti group observed in pre-defined patient groups: +7.1 months survival benefit (median of 21.9 vs. 14.8 months, nearly 50% longer) from efti with chemotherapy for patients under 65 years of age +9.4 months survival benefit (median of 22.4 vs. 12.9 months, 74% longer) from efti with chemotherapy for patients with a low starting monocyte count Statistically significant increase in CD8 T cells in patients treated with efti plus chemotherapy, correlated with prolonged OS, indicating pharmacodynamic activity and proof of concept of efti's mode of action"

Efti safety profile from phase II trial: https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/2/e001681 "Results Twenty-four patients with melanoma received pembrolizumab and bi-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of efti at doses 1 mg, 6 mg or 30 mg/injection for up to 6 months (part A) or 30 mg/injection for up 12 months (part B). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the main adverse event for efti was injection site reactions. Sustained systemic exposure to the product was obtained in all patients following s.c. injections of 30 mg dose. Treatment induced an increase in activated CD8 and CD4 T cell counts, and in some of the soluble biomarkers, particularly interferon (IFN)-Œ≥, a Th1 signature cytokine. An overall response rate (ORR) of 33% was observed in patients partly with pembrolizumab-refractory of part A and ORR of 50% was observed in patients with PD-1 na√Øve of part B.

Conclusions Efti was well tolerated in combination with pembrolizumab with encouraging antitumor activity. This warrants further clinical studies of this new combination therapy combining an antigen-presenting cell activator with an immune checkpoint inhibitor."

Financials: IMMP is a company that hasn't turned a profit, it lost $13million last year. The details on the debt situation weren't clear to me looking at yahoo finance but there is no suggestion this company is at great risk of bankuptcy and the analysts mostly consider IMMP to be a buy with an average price target of $5.98 a share. Any more info I should include in this section please let me know and I'll update.

Bear Case: This number of patients on these trials were relatively low, the trial is still ongoing with the collection of data to completed mid-2021. The stock had already spiked to $7 when the trial data was released and came down from those highs and seems to be steady at around $3-3.50 range. It was trading at $2:16 prior to this news and at the time of writing this it is currently sitting at $3:27 which is a spike of 50% It is not impossible that the stock could return to trading in the $2 range. The results of the new US trial starting this year could tank the stock if not able to replicate the positive results of the Australia trial, though I don't think we'll hear much about this trial for the next six months as it has just begun. The company is loss-making and likely will be for a while to come.

So to summarise my opinion I think this stock has got a lot of potential and if the trials this year continue to show positive results which they already have I think the stock will blow those current price targets of $5.98 out of the water. I'd like to hear what you guys think and if you agree or disagree that it is a good buy at this price_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on tripadvisor, yelp and bookings? One of the most anticipated stock category for post COVID seems to be related to travelling due to the restriction we had over the year.  A lot of people seems to bet their money on airline stocks. However, I feel that airline stock is not exactly a safe and good choice for the short term as even if their sales go up again their debt won't just vanish with the vaccine. Managing an airline is hard as it is, and after a year of extreme pandemic? I'm actually surprised that they are still holding up.

So I thought those three stocks I've mentioned might be a better choice as running a website cost wayyyyyy less than an airline and people do use those three websites a lot when travelling, I mean I certainly have. 

I currently think that tripadvisor is the best choice out of the three as: 
1. I personally do not use yelp 
2. people hate yelp 
3. I believe that people used bookings.com much more than they did with tripadvisor during the COVID era (still on going) as instead of travelling outward, more people spent their money on staying in a hotel as an escape plan from the reality.  (At least in my country they did)

So whats your thoughts on those three companies?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FOOD gene editing stocks UPDATE! Morning everyone.

You may recall I wrote a post on here not too long ago on how GMO food plays could be the next hot sector.

Good DD and suggested plays, enjoy;

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jbc4v7/the_next_hot_sector_food_gene_editing_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

For those who did read or had an interest in it, I just thought I would provide an update on how they are going. I think this sector is going to have a huge year.

My post was 91 days ago  and my suggested plays were;

Corteva (CTVA)

$33.82 Now: $44.13

Precision Bioscience (DTIL)

$6.52 Now: $9.80

Calyxt (CLXT)

$5.07 Now: $4.76
(offering/dilution occurred soon after, not ideal but has been steadily climbing)

Yield 10 Bioscience (YTEN)

$6.49 Now: $7.61

Origin Argitech (SEED)

$9.63 Now: $16.51


I was getting a lot of DMs about the original post so said it would be easier to do an update.

To answer a few questions, I am still very, very bullish on this sector. I think it is only the beginning.

My recommendation and largest holding from the above is SEED.

SEED have been working for 10 years to get their GMO right and approved by government, finally they are in and the government is ready to roll out GMO in China. SEED will dominate this space.

It has had a huge run so far but there are way more catalysts ahead and with a 3 million share float, this going to go parabolic soon. Shorts covering the higher it inevitably goes, think GameStop, Nio, XPEV type of runs , the ones that just look outrageous on your watch list.

Read more about the opportunity for SEED here

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321851/000110465920094375/tm2027521d1_ex99-1.htm

SEED turned down $24 a share in 2014.
The CFO commented ‚ÄúI tell people the value of this company is Monsanto multiplied by Baidu divided by Google,‚Äù Talk about being bullish and keeping the faith. He was right.

Again, before commenting mindless comments, ‚ÄúBUY PLTR‚Äù ‚ÄúPUMP IT‚Äù , just read the original post where I dived deep or do a quick google on GMO or the stocks above.


There are a lot of newbies, so many pump and dumpers but genuine, informative posts about companies still exist on here. I still love this sub!

I‚Äôm a long term investor so I‚Äôm not to bothered by short term volatility. SEEDs all time high was around $170 15 years ago. In a few months, SEED can be up at 30-40 and I think in a year , it can be at $100, no problem.

Hope you enjoyed and hope everyone has a great year investing!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hope this helps guys! **Overcoming dangers of loss aversion**

Hoping to bring in my 5 cents on making better future investment decisions based on some scientific research others have done and properly stolen by me. We need to keep thinking ourselves when doing investments and stay critical on what we see / read / do.

To break the ice here, please start with below statements

**Option 1:** \+$900 with a 100% chance

**Option 2:** \+ $1100 with a 90% chance

Most likely you have chosen option 1, since it has a 100% chance of succeeding, and getting your $900. 

Next scenario:

Option 1: -$900 with a 100% chance

Option 2: -$1000 with a 90% chance

Most likely you have chosen option 2 since there is a chance you will not lose any money. 

Experiment above borrowed from behaviorists Kahneman and Tversky highlights how we move to avoid loses, more than to achieve gains, as pain from losses impacts our decisions more than pleasure from gains. 

This loss aversion can negatively impact the quality of your decisions and suffocate your investment strategy. 

‚ÄúFailed investments are considered **twice as bad** as equivalent successful investments are considered good‚Äù. 

Let‚Äôs see how we can overcome this decision glitch.

&#x200B;

Research indicates that the best way overcoming the decision glitch, is **to analyze the quality of your decision process, separate from the quality of outcome.** 

To help you through this process, find the Decision Process Score Card below and follow these steps (write the answers down) 

**1.** **Identify a recent (bad) investment decision, or identify the decision you‚Äôre going to take for a certain company investment**

**2.** **Describe the decision for yourself**

Follow-up with answering these questions, **award each question answered with yes, with 1 point.**

**1.** Did I use our pre-existing decision framework? Reading this for the first time you do not yet have the framework, so no point on this one, this time. Add the framework next time and write down a point on this one.

**2.** Did I gather **relevant** information?

**3.** Did I gather **irrelevant** information? When answering yes here, you‚Äôre more likely to know what‚Äôs irrelevant, and know what to do with it next time.

**4.** Are there assumptions listed that I must challenge to make a good decision? Answering yes means you know which assumptions should be busted.

**5.** Are my sources credible? If yes, you should know where your info is coming from.

**6.** Did I detect (and eliminate) biases? If answered yes, no emotion and intuition should be in this decision.

**7.** Did I identify at least 2 alternatives on this investment opportunity?

**8.** Did I weigh the evidence **supporting** my decision?

**9.** Did I weigh evidence **rejecting** my decision?

**Score your process**

**9-8. Great decision process. Feel free to consider the outcome**

**7-5. Good decision process, almost there!**

**4-2. Meh decision process, add something to it!**

**1-0. Real poor decision process, improve it or you‚Äôll never know if it was a bad guess or a preventable mistake**

Use above to focus on avoiding potential losses due to poor DD, and enjoy yourself doing critical thinking on your decisions, even if they result in poor outcomes.

so I just got into stock investing this year and so far, I'm learning quite a lot through an online course which uses TC2000 as its trading software. Unfortunately, I can't afford or nor do I want to pirate it so I'm resorting to MT5. Although its outdated looks, I am aware that MT5 is decent software. However, there are a few problems that youtube or google cant solve for me, so here I am asking Redditors (next best thing).

First question: Why can't I place a new order? I can click the button but nothing happens, Ive tried restarting too.

2nd question: To save everyone's time, does anyone know a good guide online on how to use MT5 from the very basic? This is my first time using a trading software.

I have been lurking over at r/wallstreetbets and have gathered the following but I am not sure I have everything correct.

* $GME is going down due to the switch of everyone buying games direct online, no more going to stores. Stock is taking a nose dive.
* Activist investor  RC Ventures LLC buys in heavily (I think up to 5%?)
* Stock price continues to sit and not really move, lots of people still shorting it.
* Gamestop comes to agreement with RC Ventures LLC and gives them 3 board seats.
* The agreement with RC Ventures causes a short squeeze to occur as short-sellers bail out.

That is what I have been able to gather thus far. Is this stock not just going to tank after the short squeeze is complete or is there that much faith in RC Ventures to turn the ship around? What am I missing in this situation that warrants the investor interest?

 The COVID-19 Coronavac vaccine showed an overall effectiveness of 50.38% in Brazil.

**Chinese national pharmacy Sinopharm revealed last December that one of its candidates for the covid-19 vaccine had 79.34% effectiveness** and that it has sought permission from the authorities of Asian countries to commercialize it.

This is the first of several Chinese vaccines included in a phase 3 trial that officially announced its effectiveness in Asian giants, although the United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the participating countries, said earlier this month that it effective 86%.

In this regard, it should be noted that the Chinese health authorities have reiterated in recent months that no adverse effects were detected during experiments with different vaccine candidates developed in the country.

It‚Äôs set to list at $35 per share, but given it‚Äôs the day after AFRM‚Äôs 100% IPO, we‚Äôll see what we can get POSH at. For those who don‚Äôt know, Poshmark is just a re-commerce site (basically depop), except it‚Äôs known for its strict fees. Poshmark charges 20% on all sales above $15 (or users can opt for a $2.75 flat fee). They are so staunch on getting their fees that even if users talk about cash transactions in the app‚Äôs chat, Poshmark will literally delete the whole conversation. The app is also 10 years old and has just turned a profit, in this time it has amassed 70 million signups and these users have sold about $4 billion of their own stuff. 

This is obviously good but investors are also well aware that retention numbers are dropping. Out of those 70 million customers approximately 32 million are currently active and Poshmark is spending $225 million on marketing which is about 2/3 of its revenue. So basically expect an additional spending hike in marketing in order to boost user growth. 

The biggest thing POSH has going for it is the fact that it‚Äôs technically part of the BECKY index (and if you don‚Äôt know what that is yet, you really need to get with the culture). Just being in the BECKY index will most likely make this stock swell. The average user time in POSH is 27 mins a day and reports are out that it is way up for its strong user base during the pandemic while people are trying to make a buck.

Am I understanding long calls right? The way I'm understanding it, you pay a premium for 100 shares, decide a "strike price" for a specific date, and if the stock goes above that strike price, then you pocket the difference? As well, the maximum loss you can possibly take is the premium you pay? It just sounds too good to be true for me so I'm unsure if I'm understanding it correctly.

So I‚Äôve done a lot of personal reading and video watching and generally understand how to use the MACD and signal line as indicators as well as the baseline to determine if a stock is moving bullish or bearish, but one thing that‚Äôs not discussed and I see mentioned on this topic is if it moves below 0 that can be a sign of a change in the trend of the stock, but when you extrapolate out to say 6 months or 1 month it will show the trend line for MACD often times above the 0 line, but for a short term outlook like 5 days it swings in and out for many stocks. I know this is just one indicator of many to look at like RSI, the news, and DD on market cap, eps, and debt, but why do different timelines show different baselines for MACD and how is it best to use each timeline?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Favorite Podcast?

When you look at the likes of plug power (the current hydrogen big boy) I believe that ITM has got soo much opportunity for growth. I honestly believe they could be Europe‚Äôs answer to plug power. I know they may not get the market exposure seen as though they are traded on the London stock exchange but I honestly believe that ITM will be in the FTSE 100 within the coming years. In the past year the drive to turn greener is becoming bigger and bigger; governments across the world are promising to invest heavily in an effort to make their nations carbon neutral. Covid has has only caused this drive to accelerate, the hottest markets in the US are all centred around Green energy: EV, batteries, wind, hydrogen anything that is reducing carbon emissions has seen stock prices double within the last year. The U.K. markets tend to lag behind the US and okay it sees nowhere near the investment also; if you can find those winning stocks that are going to change the way we do things forever then there going to see moment regardless of what market they trade on. Petrol and diesel cars will be a thing of the past in the coming decade. ITM are primed to take hold of this opportunity to gain there share of the market, not only do I expect that they will monopolies the UKs hydrogen supply; they already have contracts in place outside the U.K. here‚Äôs what makes ITM a good Investment right now: 

- ITM have just finished completion of their giga factory in Sheffield and manufacturing has commenced ( check their website to see it)
- With production ramping up they‚Äôve already announced (this week) to supply their product to linde in Germany and have a partnership agreement with a sales company ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô to support sales in Australasia. They‚Äôve also got funding to support a study in offshore green hydrogen production with Siemens. 

ITM share price is currently ¬£6.63 and looking at the chart (if your a technical analyst) you may think it‚Äôs due a pull back but I can guarantee you people will be saying I wish I‚Äôd bought when I read that article as opposed to waiting for a drop that never came. This is only the beginning for ITM and the future for hydrogen with contracts likely to come in thick and fast. With manufacturing at their giga factory under way they are soo far ahead of any competitors.

So i just began taking over my investments. Well in October of 2020....
I am 38 and want to be aggressive since i wont touch this money for 20 years

I am investing in....Tax free account, retirement account and emergency fund

I have 25k invested in a mix of stocks and indexes.  I only have 1k in cash. 
 I keep hearing you need 15 or 20% in cash and bonds? my question is.... I want to be prepared if there is a market crash so I could buy the dips.  sooo should I be holding 20% of cash in reach account.......in my case $5,000 total? or should I put $5,000 in bonds which will collect dividends and I could easily buy the dip by selling the bond then? Since i have no idea when the crash would be?

How do you plan your portfolio.... Big or small ?

They believe that mutant p53 is an attractive therapeutic target.

-Anticipated cash burn 2021 $30M-$35M.
-Cash to fund operations into 2023.

**Notes**
-They have received Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drub and Fast Track Designations from the FDA for their MDS product. 
-They have received Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission for MDS, AML and Ovarian Cancer. 
- Late December the stock price fell from $30-$4.66 due to an overreaction from the Market on news of a failed Phase 3 trial on another product. Some of this growth should be gained back organically slowly over 2021.

**2021 Possible Catalyst**
- 2nd Generation p53 reactivator, APR 548- First patient enrolled in Phase 1 trial
- Phase 2 MDS/ AML Post-transplant maintenance- Primary endpoint read Out Q2

I want to give you something back, so here is my gift called Ehang ($EH). First thank all of you guys, I love the discussions here and got some great picks from you. Now I will thank you with this ticker:


Ehang is a chinese company that manufactures autonomous aeriel vehicles (drones) and the first company to launch their air taxis. They got enough money to burn for years and are on the way to profitability. (Check out Bloomberg video or other sources for finances). They are run by a smart tech guy who is also a workaholic. Check out there Youtube, they post every week and you get a feeling for their team and products.


They plan to build at least 600 units this year and probably a lot more each year after. The potential for this is insane, maybe we will see a lot tourist usage at first (as in Hong Kong) and then more and more as taxi. They got at least China, South Korea, Japan and I bet on UAE and Qatar as early market.


They also got firefighting and cargo drones with deals already with DHL and some company for organ transportation but the main reason to buy for me is the taxi.


I commented here a lot about them, first @11, now they reached 38, I wanted to post earlier but better late then never. Of course we could see profit taking but this run is based on the start of the taxi (way earlier than expected) and I predict we keep the momentem until at least 50. 

It is of course a high risk play and big chance of a big correction, so best to buy small position now and than buy the dip if we get one, avg up or just put them on your watchlist. I think we are still in the early stage and 38 $ will look insanly cheap in the future.

I would be very happy to hear your voices on this, thanks for the read.

Right so they have many toes in many fields but why are they down then? 

Coronavirus effecting the aerospace feild  and no-deal brexit hype and the subsequent share dump.

Both issues are enigmatic(look up what enigmatic means like I had to) lies and are extremely short term problems.

 It doesn't take a monkeys brain to understand that a VACCINE IS OUT!!!! The economic recovery is a sub year problem and we have reached the deepest trench, only up from here

No-deal brexit is not a problem but a solution for Rolls Royce's üèÄ and ‚õìÔ∏è parent company BMW. This will force them to become more independent and take more risks(like nuclear space exploration for instance). Also they are prepared and have taken huge economic precautions to weather any storm no-deal brexit throws at them.

I am seeing a lot of discussion about APHA And Tilray on this page but I see no one talking about Planet 13. Any reasons why?

Planet 13 
- already based in the US.
- currently based at LV but are developing a superstore at California and there are rumours that they will follow this with an expansion to Florida. 
- they are customer centric and more than an MJ company, their superstore is more than MJ and is more like a theme park or tourist attraction! Their superstore is primed to be more than cannabis store and serve as a one stop shop for other items for those staying At LV. 
- they just recently announced an up size public offering 12.02.2021.
- they had 36.5% increase in their turnover from the prior year period.
- when this covid mess is all passed us for sure the footfall in LV and Planet 13 will only increase! 
- I think this will also benefit from the legalisation of sports betting for both short and long term.
