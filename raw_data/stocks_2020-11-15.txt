Anyone know the answer to this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Largest U.S. Pension Bought Up EV Stocks Nikola and NIO, and Zoom The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

As I'm sure it would take hours to research and still not find what I need to know to get in there, thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JWN Nordstrom I’ve been holding a large position in JWN for about 5 months now. I first bought in on June 11 which was right after it crashed from $24 to $17. I’ve added monthly ever since and my average price is currently $15. There’s still a lot of upside to this stock, I’m sure. I have to admit I was a little surprised to see the downtrend/flatlining from June - November which was not at all as volatile as March to June. I’d expected it to keep on being quite volatile. Anyway, it’s all good now I suppose. I’m hoping the new floor is more like $15 or preferably $17, obviously rather than ~$12 which has been the support level the past 3 months or so. 

Virus numbers are increasing day by day (but I suppose more people are getting tested now compared to earlier this year so that explains part of the increase). Still, Biden’s Covid team announced they won’t go for another lockdown as did Trump which is why JWN kept climbing, initiated by the promising Pfizer vaccine news. 

Earnings are coming up and Nordstrom’s anniversary sale turnover which is their biggest sale of the year will be included (as opposed to last year when this happened in Q2) and Erik Nordstrom, their CEO, said this year it was bigger than ever before. I’ve closely been checking reviews on Google for various Nordstrom and Rack stores and they are usually very good. People tend to post photos, too - on Google reviews and on Twitter, and generally their stores seem to have been buzzing. Maybe not as busy as pre-Covid but definitely not deserted as the dirt cheap stock price will have you believe. 

To me the future of JWN has to do mostly with whether you believe customers will continue to shop at department stores like Nordstrom, Macy’s and Kohl’s or if these will lose a huge chunk of their customer base to online stores like Amazon etc. 

Personally I believe once this virus disappears or people get immunity by vaccine, gradually we will go back to pre-Covid shopping routines. Sure, some will have been introduced to online shopping and stick with it but I think most people already knew about online shopping prior to Covid and I think the people that used to go to department stores will do that again. Online shopping isn’t a new thing. So why would people go to department stores a year ago if online shopping is better? Convenience is a relative matter. To a lot of people the shopping experience of going to a department store brings a lot of convenience with it. You can go with your friends. You can feel and try the items before you purchase them. You avoid the hassle of having to return items that aren’t the right size.. Amazon killed bookstores- because a book is always the same. You’d rarely need to return a book. Buying a suit, a dress or a pair of jeans is different. Zalando (big European apparel e-commerce site) recently announced that about half of the products they sell are returned. Half! That’s crazy. 

I’ve not mentioned all the things that make Nordstrom stand out between itself and its competition. First, keep in mind a lot of the competition has gone bankrupt. JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor.. the list goes on. Second, Nordstrom has so much going for it when it comes to adapting to a changing retail landscape. Less full line stores, more racks and locals. Expansion of curbside pickup. More things added to the shopping experience.. look it up yourself, there’s a lot of clever stuff. 

Anyway, I didn’t mean to make such a long post but I thank you if you want to share your thoughts on this stock. So, what do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment Club: How to avoid having members vote on each stock investment? I know its possible to invest for others in a stock trading investment club.

(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to announce next week a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, five years earlier than previously planned, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.

Britain had originally planned to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars from 2040, as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and in February Johnson brought this forward to 2035.

Industry figures show that petrol and diesel powered cars accounted for 73.6% of new car sales so far this year, while just 5.5% of sales were for pure electric vehicles, which are typically more expensive.
