Congrats to the original crew that executed the short squeeze on gme. Was a brilliant play because Cohen was the billionaire shield. Shorts thought Cohen was buying more and panic covering happened because many shorts had already made a killing.

It went over 100% and since it’s lows a lot more. It’s now way overvalued. I should know I was a store manager when Paul reins was CEO and the stock price was deservedly 55 back then. 

Take ur money and run. 
The fanboy myth these other are trying to sell is pure smoke and mirrors. The real guys behind the posts already made millions off the move and are smartly exiting. 

Ryan Cohen Is a moron who got lucky in pet products which have huge margin and was competing with retail companies who weren’t online like they should of been with peg products. He has never been on the sales floor as a store manager and doesn’t understand GameStop, It’s customers or how video games are different this cycle then all the others before.

You fools thinking Cohen is anything special are going to lose your gold. 
Cohen has 3 Seats and isn’t ceo 
Even if he was his ideas are bad 
He doesn’t understand the GameStop consumer 
This console cycle is different 
Xbox series X backward compatibility means you don’t need to trade in your games and ur gonna keep ur library 
High speed downloads means more and more of your titles are gonna come directly from Microsoft and Sony 
You really think gme is gonna do more business digitally when you get everything you need from microsoft store and Sony’s stores and half the new consoles being sold don’t have a disk drive.... really.... yeah go to GameStop and buy a code and then go home and enter ur code and download ur game or... stay home and buy it at a discount from the store. 



GameStop store mangers. District managers, regional managers and executive team are all terrible. All the good ones are gone. iPhone trades are now primarily done at the Verizon and att stores now because of the deals they offer so those sales are down and Will stay down as well. 

50% of profit use to come from used game sales. 
Now if you want to buy an old game... you could get it from GameStop or again like new titles you could get it directly from Microsoft or Sony’s store. 

Have you noticed in the pandemic store hours are terrible, staffing is terrible and it’s become half a bobble head toy store.

This is blockbuster and Cohen’s dreams of getting you to buy a guy from a physical store is a novelty that will progressively get worse every year because of less and less customer interaction with team members about the games. Streamers and direct purchase options are putting the nail in GameStop’s coffin. 

Anyways just tying to help some of you keep your gains and ur cash. GameStop is going back to slowly declining into death because the business model wants to implement will not work. 

Hey what do I know though.... I was top 10 store manager back when the company had good leadership and have sold more power pro memberships then you can imagine.  Next generation cycles were relevant to physical locations back then. 

GameStop is a dying company and Cohen won’t change that... his plans are actually going to a accelerate it

Hope this helps someone keep there life savings or take there well earned gains. These people thinking it’s gonna go to the moon aren’t realistic about expectations or understanding why GameStop did so well the last gen cycle.

Good luck gamers

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME.  Should likely be flagged as NSFW as for many this will be a masturbatory aid for many until the markets open.

**Pre-amble**

I had an epiphany last night and the world just starting make sense. Instead of being overcome by a wave of relief and calmness, I was crushed by a feeling of dread and experienced one of my restless nights of my life. Respite only came by drowning out my thoughts with a bottle of bourbon. 

This first post outlines why GME will experience a short squeeze in the very short term. Dread is the pending dead of this community - undue blame will come from the media with WSB and retail traders in general to take the immediate brunt of the assault. With the additional media attention will come calls for regulation of financial derivatives and further assaults on the ‘gamification’ of investing. This post is just to set the foundation of the actual record on what is going to come.  

Those that are active in this community or have been lurking for the past couple years can attest to the increasing media attention that WSB has been receiving. This growth is now exponential with Jim Cramer basically leading a WSB public relations campaign and providing near daily commentary to his audience. There has been a material shift in dynamics in this subreddit over the past year. Many new faces of which quite frankly are financially illiterate. Please do your own research and understand how financial markets and derivates work – I have made this as friendly as possible but if you can’t grasp it get your wife’s boyfriend to simplify it for you.  

Many of you will not with in the financial markets and not yet grasp the scope of the WSB community as a whole, which is collectively its own hedge fund. The userbase is the working class looking to break out and live some kind of semblance of normal life, chasing the American dream, which is only getting further and further out of reach. We are little guys and accordingly rely on free brokerages like Robinhood, which results in our collective trade execution being complete garbage. Buying into a position results in thousands of users spamming the ask price on Robinhood and driving up market price. If we were a proper hedge fund, the aggregate positions would be acquired through algorithms co-located with the exchanges and other than potential volume spikes would only be actionable through review of regulatory filings.  

We also maintain like the largest research group in the country with thousands of users undergoing financial research and compiling DD on potential new plays. This research is compiled, disseminated, and reviewed, and actioned in real-time which is why attention is picking up. 

We are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning. 

Cramer – giving the shifting demographics, I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji’s into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment.   

**GME Short Squeeze**

**1. Why can insider purchases/sales move the market** 

Company insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it’s a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued. Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human (or some kind of reptile, robot, human hybrids) and they need money to service their lifestyles. 

In WSB terms, if you are yolo’ing funds for a down payment on your house (or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway) do you realize your gains when you hit your goal? This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo’s) and isn’t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo’s are better long-term investments than the stock market. 

Insider trades are a potential signal only.  

**2. What happened last week.** 

From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    

As per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. 

Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn’t a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. 

The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines – these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read ([https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410\_6](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6)). 

As a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio’s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it’s a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James’s clients missed out on 50% one day gains.

Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  

What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the \~900,000 shares divested above. 

**3. What is a Gamma Squeeze**

This is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option’s and the role of Market Makers (“MM”). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   

**Delta**: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. 

**Gamma**: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. 

**Market Makers**: the MM’s trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM’s create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  

With that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (“Melvin”) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole’s notes are below.  

Melvin’s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml))  

The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a 

MM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  

Cohen’s board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM’s exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. 

**4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO**

When you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   

Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM’s, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) 

Threshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list ([https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. 

The relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: 

Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. 

Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn’t really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days ([https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list))   

What is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn’t like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19) 

There have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. 

**6. Ryan Cohen’s Twitter Profile**

For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber “so you’re telling me there’s a chance”

He is building a social media presence that previously didn’t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 – The National Anthem)   

The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. 

**7. Short Interest Position**

Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close ([http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) 

[Above chart courtesy of u\/StarSwitch post’ as I don’t have an OTEX account. Link to post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kx047v\/gme\_options\_update\_melvin\_put\_positions\_and\_volume\/  ](https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b)

What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. 

What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. 

**6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d

The last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. 

So, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). 

So back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  

The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it’s their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. 

In section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn’t any float remaining – the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. 

For those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  

**7. What will come**

As many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don’t want to get caught. 

Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.

The short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. 

I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.

My personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TWTR appears to be a good potential buy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

Positions in $TWTR: None. I made this DD for fun. If you are interested in purchasing $TWTR shares or calls, I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in. This is not financial advice. All of the material presented is just opinion that needs to be verified and is subject to change._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I’m playing GME <-> NVAX If your like me, you’ve been patiently waiting for NVAX news, only to miss the TSLA run and the GME pop last week. 

Here’s how I’m trying to catch the the GME squeeze and roll all those tendies into NVAX or vice versa. 

By my reckoning we have about a week before NVAX South African PH-II. In preparation I have half my account in 02/19 130c options. 

Hopefully GME will squeeze hard Tuesday. I currently have the other half of my portfolio in 02/19 40c options. 

Alternately GME might be flat and NVAX may hit.  Whichever comes first I’m going to chain these two events together. If NVAX pops I’ll roll profits into shares. If GME, I’ll accumulate more options in NVAX. 

On Tuesday another 4k will clear and I will throw all that into GME shares to do my part to force the squeeze._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just put in market orders to sell $20k of positions to dump into TSLA during the dip. yolo. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (HUYA DD) Huya, the Twitch of China DD.

[On Dec. 14](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4582108007237649?), China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that the government has started to investigate the merger between[ DouYu](https://esportsobserver.com/tag/douyu/) and[ Huya](https://esportsobserver.com/tag/huya/), which focuses on the concentration of undertakings in Variable Interest Entity (VIE).

**Fun stuff to consider:**

esports has been approved by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) as a medaled sport in the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. In addition, China’s esports industry also saw a multi-million dollar investment by a game publisher to an esports organization.

**My own trendlines:**

Long term trendlines of \~$21.73 (red line below) after bouncing off of the short-term 30 min trendline (the purple below) or $18.14 based on fib sequences, means that they are (IMO) bottomed out and the weak hands have sold, leaving a ton of room for growth. 

IF it stays above this red, long term trendline, it will be a $40 stock by summer. On top of that, IF the merger goes through though, this thing will be much, much higher than that even.

BB is looking good for a couple reasons. 

1. Rumor of settled lawsuits with FB in BB's favor. Should have details within two weeks. 
2. BB just sold phone patents to Huwawei. This frees them from their smartphone burdens and gives more capital for their EBIT. 
3. BB's CEO just signed a deal where he gets massive $$ if share prices hit $16,$20, and $30.

Im in at 13C for February 19th._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RBLX to the moon. IPO incoming! Roblox expects direct listing on NYSE in February

Roblox said earlier this week that it raised $520 million in private capital ahead of a direct listing.

The company originally planned to go public in December but delayed its debut after DoorDash and Airbnb soared more than expected out of the gates.

The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol "RBLX."

Roblox said on Friday in an updated prospectus that it plans to go public through a direct listing next month, after the online game company delayed its debut in December.

Earlier this week, Roblox disclosed that it raised $520 million in a private financing round ahead of a direct listing. By taking this route to the public markets instead of a traditional IPO, Roblox is following Spotify, Slack, Palantir and Asana, sidestepping a share sale and instead allowing existing stakeholders and employees to sell stock to new investors right away.

The latest funding round, at $45 a share, valued Roblox at $29.5 billion. In the updated filing, Roblox said an independent valuation report in December placed the shares at $41.52 apiece. By raising some money before going public, Roblox was able to pad its balance sheet and preserve the ability to bring in more capital through a secondary sale later this year.

Under the direct listing, the NYSE will set a reference price for the stock the night before Roblox's debut, but no shares will be traded at that price. In the morning, the market makers will match buyers and sellers to determine the opening price and the stock will be available to the broader market under the ticker symbol "RBLX."

Roblox had been considering a more traditional IPO, but tabled its plans last month after DoorDash and Airbnb popped on consecutive days, leading to concern that the company risked leaving too much money on the table.

"Due to market volatility and the performance of other recent underwritten initial public offerings, we have elected to file this prospectus as an amendment to the registration statement and pursue a direct listing to permit determination of the opening public price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers," Roblox said in the prospectus.

Because it's not doing an IPO, Roblox no longer requires underwriters. The company said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will stay on as financial advisers, but JPMorgan, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets were removed from the filing.

Roblox, which first released its service in 2006, is hitting the public market following a year of dramatic growth as kids, who were forced to stay home during the pandemic, spent more time playing games.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 91% from a year earlier to $242.2 million. Daily active users almost doubled in the period ended September to 36.2 million and "hours engaged" more than doubled to 8.7 billion.

On Roblox's app, users create an avatar that they can move between millions of different games. They're all free to play, but users buy virtual currency called Robux for advanced features or to build their character.

The games are created by outside developers, who share the revenue with Roblox. The company said in the updated filing that in the first three quarters of 2020, the platform had about 3,800 developers, who earned $215 million. That's up from a year earlier, when 2,400 developers made $72.2 million.

While many game creators cash out into real world currency, "some choose to reinvest their Robux into developer tools, promote their experiences through our internal ad network, or spend the Robux as any other user would," the company said.

Swiss-Rock,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Legging in to secure your profits with a Ghetto Spread! *Please do not waste money on awards, I know you guys are retarded but spend that on books and services to further your knowledge like this to get those gains!.. or not retards will do what they do*

Also special mention to u/leobanksjr for explaining and breaking it down with scenarios, thanks buddy we miss you too!

I come to realize with my recent folly during this bull market, how it resembles September rally into October nightmare, the recent political disaster on capital hill leading into inauguration day for the new president and most notably the sheer increase in VIX calls & SPY puts in the options flow services that we need a firm and in-depth discussion in persevering and hedging those recent gains.

**THIS IS STRATEGY FOR GUYS THAT DO NOT WANT TO USE A DAY TRADE CLOSING OUT DUE TO PDT RULE**

Allowing you to secure profits within the same day of opening that trade with a  open call without triggering a day trade and comfortably closing the entire trade or just that added in leg the next day at market open without risking prior day gains. Explanation in more detail follows.

*Using margin account with at least level 3 available (spreads) is required. Cash accounts will not work with this.*

*Explanation of a Ghetto Spread & Legging in*

You would let the naked call inflate and as soon as momentum slows or end of day occurs.

* **Just sell strike right above it basically creating a bull call spread** *(lock in profits with limited further upside) for stocks that may continue to advance* or sell that short leg the next day without affecting PDT making it a long naked call again.
* **~~Sell the strike below current naked long call and create a bear call spread~~** ~~if you think the stock has in short term exhausted and has some downside (~~*~~Lock in profits and limited profits on the move down)~~*~~.~~

EDITED:

This has been pointed out there a downside I failed to mention, if the sold to open lower call strike and it goes from out of the money to in the money it at greater risk of being exercised early. This is true for any STO shorted option but it definitely applies here.

* ***Or if you moved several strikes already sell the current ATM strike and get credited more premium.*** If stock moves above and that spread expires if you choose to hold the locked in profit is yours as well potential the credit received if it expires above or below the sold call depending on type of spread

*Why do this at all?*

1. Legging into a spread by opening a short call above current long strike not only locked in gains at end of day by preserving any profit \*from unpleasant gaps and market opening swings.\*EDITED: one may of caught a breakout and it ran too high, gone too parabolic and for some reason they cannot use a day trade to close so this nothing more than a stop gap measure to close out in the next morning.
2. Also prevented theta/time decay because the shorted option receive credit from the decay too if you are doing something like weeklies.
3. Allowing me to assess the next day and decide *either to maintain the spread until favorable conditions to close out the leg all without using valuable day trades if your under PDT rules (lower than 25k in USA)*
4. You might not want to weather a short dip that could turn larger than expected on an otherwise momentum play that just starting out.
5. **Keep in mind unless the legged in spread** ***is*** *actual delta neutral* **their will be a very small loss but bulk of profits are secured.**

So If I bought KERN at 6 calls and it moved to $8 I can sell to open (STO) an $8 call (shorted) and it locks current gains. If I hold that spread rather than return naked call at the next day into expiration and the price has indeed went under $8 I get to keep the profit I locked in **and the premium received** from selling the $8 call if I do the same thing but it expires above $8 call I lose the premium but still keep the locked in profits when I created the spread. Exact opposite for a bear call spread (opening a short call strike *below* current naked long call)

**WHY NOT USE A CASH ACCOUNT?**

* *Cash accounts work for larger balances that can position size correctly*
* *Smaller accounts use up more settled funds to get a more costly longer dated contracts, making it difficult to position with what you may be comfortable with.*
* *Weeklies time decay only makes their use practical for day trade but risky to guess & hold for next day movement*
* *Might not spot an opportunity until later in the day and then have to choose between giving up an existing trade and a day for funds to settle.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LOW rocket ship is now re-fuelled - launch to $200 is imminent So listen before I get started, I get it - this is not TSLA or GME or PLTR  which are some of my favorites, but somehow our fellow autists have missed the ongoing run up of LOW. I believe there is still time to get into this trade and make some serious tendies on both cheap ass calls and stock into earnings and even past.

IT HAS BEEN UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS YEAR - WHY ?  STONKS ONLY GO UP.

1) Lowes announced a massive stock buy back of $15 billion dollars last month. Lowes is going to the market and buying almost 20% of all outstanding shares, that's how much money they have, think about that for a second. They don't buy back stock to lose money, they buy back to make their shareholders money by increasing the share price. 

2) Stimmy - the first round of stimmy benefited home retailer companies like LOW and HD in a massive way. Papa Joe is sending another $1400 and like it or not, many to people who don't need the money and will be going and spending on their homes with this. 

3) Interest Rates - starting to creep up and many people are rushing to refinancing their pads and renovating with extra cash, they will be going to HD and LOW for alot of this.

Here's the current chart of LOW  - as you can see it has been rocketing forward even when the market has been experiencing a bit of red this week. This is a play into earnings and maybe longer if they crush it in Q4.

BULL MARKET IS HERE AND BACK UP NEXT WEEK LETS GOOOOOOo.

I've been lurking this board for five years, WSB was part of what inspired me to pursue a future in trading. I got a job on a bank trading floor and will be legally unable to share tips after I get into the office. This is my parting gift to the community of idiots that sparked a fire that changed the course of my life.

Fucking Alibaba. This is an absolute juggernaut of a company that is currently plagued by every piece of FUD possible. Chinese government whipped out the cock & a centimeter ruler. Ant Group IPO hamstrung. Impending regulation. Jack Ma in hiding for fear of having his mouth cauterized shut. Down 30% from ATH. WSB mocking call holders who caught the falling knife. This kind of dark cloud overhang is exactly what I look for in my trades. There are always big gain opportunities, but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities (GME, EVs, SPACs).

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*CATALYSTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\*\*\*\*\***

&#x200B;

**RELATIVE VALUATION:**

First and foremost, this is a great company. This isn't some kind of "I'm the smartest idiot in town" play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless. This is a truly undervalued equity. Chinese stocks have been super hot lately. Mega hot. This isn't necessarily bubbly. China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket-like growth for years to come. Look up Dalio's thoughts on China if you need to be convinced. Stocks like JD, PDD, BILI, BIDU, NIO, have all seen unbelievable rises. Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure. I don't blame them. However, after these astronomical rises, money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities. Cue Alibaba. This one has herpes currently. It won't have herpes forever. There's a black swan risk for Alibaba. It won't happen. As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly. The valuation is too sexy. It's been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals.

**UM AKSHYUALLY IT'S A VIE YOU DON'T OWN THE STOCK**

Shut the fuck up. People talk about the ownership structure like it's a latent scam to defraud American's of 100s of billions of dollars. This will not happen. China needs access to US capital markets. This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China. Yes, China is the manufacturing capitol of the world. Yes, the USA is the financial capital of the world. We are mutually dependent. If this falls through, we all have way bigger problems than your $2000 call position. Market is fucked period if USA & China go nuclear in the financial markets. Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing.

**INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT**

CCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba. The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well. It's so transparent. CCP is pushing down Alibaba's value, seizing more ownership, then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves. Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress? China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs. I don't care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life. This thing will continue to grow. Baba is bigger than Jack Ma.

**HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS** ***( skip if you're afraid of numbers )***

30% YoY revenue growth. 60% YoY growth in AWS copycat. 900 million MAUs. FCF up 33% YoY to $6 Billion US. Increased share buyback.

And the margins. Look at the fucking margins. 29% net profit margin for FY 2019. With 30% Revenue growth. AMZN's net margin is 4%. This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see ***bonerworthy*** FCF and boost buybacks. In my opinion, this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world. Held down by FUD.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*FINALLY- WHAT MAKES THIS MOON?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**#1- Jan 20-** Joe Biden takes office. He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump, so he gets a patty-cake deal done with China. Fears about delisting subside. Institutional money gets braver. Black swan risk becomes more muted. I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in. His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable. Great for BABA & US/China relations.

**#2- Feb 11-** Earnings. Earnings will be stellar as always. China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream. The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is. Expect a pop if it hasn't already ran up a shit ton beforehand.

**#3- Date unknown-** Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba. It will not be as bad as everyone expects. This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is. Once that uncertainty gets removed, this thing flies. Same goes for Ma reappearance. When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool, expect an instant pop in share price. There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this. This is where you want to be going long.

**How do I play it?**

Shares are fine. I was long BABA shares, sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good. 40% IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect. I wouldn't buy calls expiring before the summer. Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds. It has been trading in a tight range from 220-245, If it dips back to 220 I'm adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which I will unload when it breaks out, letting my LEAPs ride.

When this thing shakes off the bad press it will fly. I can see $400 before EOY, at which price it'll still be cheaper than its peers.

**Positions: 2x 300C LEAPs expiring Jan 20, 2023, cost basis $6500, current value $8200**   🚀🚀🚀

Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include,  [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

They also have **more cash** **than Debt**.

Edit2:  Thank you u/Pure_Contribution_14 for SpaceX addition._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Autists trying to convince their boomer parents to get in on GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ELY to the Moon 🚀🚀🚀 After being inspired by [u/PlatNoFeatures](https://www.reddit.com/user/PlatNoFeatures/) and his post on ELY I decided to look into it some more and figuring out how high this thing can go after merging with Topgolf. 

Callaway is currently projected to do $1.55B in revenue in 2020 with an expected growth rate of 10.5% for future years while Topgolf will do revenues of about $1.1B while experiencing a 30% growth rate since 2017. This 30% growth can continue for many years to come as the company is still rapidly growing and expanding its venues. Also, over half of Topgolf's customers consider themselves non-golfers so this gives Callaway a huge market to bring in new customers to their golf apparel and equipment revenue streams. 

For my analysis, I projected Callaway and Topgolf's revenues out to 2025 with the above mentioned projected growth rates, and came to a combined revenue estimate of $6.63B in 2025. I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. **Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85.** 

If anyone can make this price happen its the amazing retards at WSB. Let's get to work 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tuesday morning GME vibes _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The MAN has tweeted. Papa Cohen _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Simple Palantir (PLTR) Perspective   Okay guys I really think Palantir has a lot of room to run over the course of the next week or so, just hear me out. Let me just start out by saying this is one opinion of a single retard on wall street bets and you should not just buy in cuz of me! Anyways here we go pigeons, on Friday 1/15/2021 Ark Invest (all hail our queen Cathie Wood) made a significant stock purchase of Palantir for the first time since initially taking a position mid-November. The Ark Invest hype train is real right now, look at other similar new investments from ARK we’ve seen significant positive price action in the weeks that follows mass quantity share purchases. Last time queen Cathie bought a significant amount of shares in PLTR we saw the stock price nearly double in the coming weeks. Now before you clowns try to call me out let me be clear, this alone is not enough to double up the stock price from current levels. BUT WAIT. DID I MENTION THERE IS MORE??

On January 26th 2021, Palantir will have a major event called “Live Demo Day” where the company will display the efficiency of its products to the world. This could be a massive short term catalyst combined with Queen Cathie’s purchase. What the hell does this tendy-lious company sell you might ask? Their products are basically Artificial Intelligence that rapidly analyzes massive quantities of data for business’s in order to improve daily operations. The more the internet scales and the more data is collected by businesses, the more demand there is for data processing. As companies scale their technological forces they often cannot keep up with processing the data to make efficient business decisions, this is where Palantir comes in. Oh and did I mention Palantir has contracts with the US Army and FDA?? Government entity partnerships are very good way to get large businesses to trust your ability to analyze data efficiently! Palantir has also been processing vaccine trial data to look for patterns, this opens the door to pharmaceutical companies pursuing partnerships in the future as they observe what significance Palantir has in gathering Covid vaccine data. It also appears to become more and more common for businesses to need data processing to make better business decisions as the internet scales. So what the fuck is my point? This is a great story for investors to buy into and is exactly the kind of thing that can get the hype train going. IN MY OPINION, three very powerful words. In my opinion, Demo day is very similar to an event like Tesla battery day where significant progress in the business model is on display a provides investors of a vision of where the company is heading. And if there’s anything I’ve learned in 2020, vision fucking matters.

The fact the company went public through a Direct public offering rather than an initial public offering can prove to be significant, allow me to explain. Direct public offerings’ tend to not get as much hype upon listings compared to Initial public offerings. Now I know you clowns reading this thinking BuT LoOk HoW mUcH tHe StOnK hAs MoOnEd AlReAdY. But consider this, look at how Snowflake, Doordash, and other various IPO’s have absolutely skyrocketed on their opening trading days and they were all backed by major underwriters. Since (PLTR) was a direct public offering I personally believe the true hype is not entirely baked into this stock. Instead it has slowly been noticed and demo day is a fantastic opportunity for the world to hear Palantir’s story and finally really understand the long term vision and the profitable scalability business opportunity they have. Demo day, in case you can’t connect the dots, DEMO-nstrates Palantir’s product lineup of artificial intelligence. Regardless of what we actually see from the products there will for sure be a lot of hype about the potential of these products.  

Palantir Counter Arguments:

Lockup Period Expiry: The lockup period ends mid-February shortly after earnings are reported. The lockup period could go either way, but if the employees believe in the company they will hold a majority of their shares are they have first hand vision of what’s unfolding for Palantir. Can’t stomach the risk of the lock up period? No worries this is still a month away and there’s plenty of time to get in and out of this stock before the lockup expiry even becomes a relative issue.

Last ER showed significant losses: A majority of losses last earnings report were a result of direct listing regulatory fees! These fees are not recurring, they were one time fees to take the company public. Considering this is a tech company, operating costs tend to be low and generally consistent. Therefore, as revenue scales, profit margins should theoretically soar along with it over the long term.  Again, earnings are a month out so if you cannot stomach the risk of a bad earnings report you can still sell out prior to this. 

All in all, my point is this. Short term catalysts could really start to push this stock upwards to new all-time highs this week into next leading up to Demo day. And for long term consideration, any dips over the next couple months could be fantastic buying opportunities. Only time will tell. Just remember I am not a financial advisor you fucking pigeon. But with that being said the risk/reward long term is quiet enticing when you look at what this company is trying to do. I hope I at least got this at the top of your watch list after writing all this crap, clearly I’m bullish as fuck short term and long term. Cya on the m00n autists. 

Side Note : Fuck Grammar I read charts not books

EDIT: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME warning: Bears are among us. Tuesday is bullish. I dare you to prove me wrong. Hello fellow autists,

I am back. Nothing makes me more upset than the big boys trying to manipulate the autists. It actually makes my blood boil. What got me motivated to write my first reddit post ever was exactly this.

So, there was a post recommending GME puts that got unusually high numbers of upvotes as well as awards, at an unusually high rate. I’m convinced that this guy is from the short side. It wreaked of PR farm.

The knowledge level displayed within the post proved that the OP has a pretty good grasp on the market. However, they omitted some of VERY important key details, while recommending puts/forecasting bearish movement.

**They’re promising tendie heaven while they lead you to a slaughter house.**

This is good though, the fact the shorts are employing tactics like this means they feel that heat is turned up and they are starting to sweat.

Unless you are ready to die now, don’t follow them. Here are some FACTS - longer but super easy to understand as always.

**1. Yes, margin requirement is shooting up** on multiple brokers and a lot of LONGS as well as SHORTS are going to be margin called. Margin requirement going up is something that naturally happens as big movement/volatility is expected. It’s just like how you pay a higher interest rate/higher down payment when they think you are a ‘risky’ buyer wanting to buy a car/house/giant dildo.

# The Melvin underling OP wrote, “Big institutions who are holding shorts won’t be affected by this” Are you fucking kidding me?

Shorts are borrowed shares from the shareholders. If you are buying on margin, you have what is called a hypothecation agreement with your broker. The shares you buy on margin are automatically available for the big institutions to borrow to short the stock.

Just Google “your broker” + “hypothecation agreement”. Most brokers have this.

**What does this mean?**

Yes, the margin call happen to both longs and shorts, but margin call happening to longs also mean the institutional shorts are forced to cover because the shares they are borrowing is getting liquidated/called away. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Also, on most brokers, margin account is a requirement to short a stock as well.

**What does THIS mean?**

When margin call happens\*\*(due to the margin requirement going way up)\*\*, the short side gets a double whammy: Short positions of many retail account holders are forced to close, and short positions of big institutions are also forced to close.

Yeah, they’ve been touting “Buy only shares, don’t buy calls, duh” and this may be because they want to have an advantage over you. Shares as well as calls have their own merit. Yes IV/premium is high I know but just do the math and don’t get stuck buying just shares.

They are basically telling you “knives only” when they are bringing “knives + guns” who remembers those conniving bastards from playing CS? See my first post for more information on this.

Think about it, why would they say “buy shares only” at the same time Melvin Capital spent over 35 million dollars on buying 51,000 puts? (This expired completely worthless btw good job)

**2. Uptick rule/SSR kicked in because the stock dropped 10%**

Long story short, this rule was created so shorts can’t just keep chasing and drilling stocks to the ground. There are a lot of videos explaining YouTube I don’t want to keep this long. Multiple videos also mention higher probability of a squeeze when this happens.

Basically, the shorts hands are tied, and they can only kick. The long side is free to swim however. Now tell me, who can swim to the tendie island faster? The yachts are anchored there and they are yours for the taking.

Remember, Cohen is a smart dude who built a $3.5B business from scratch which is now 44.61B as of today.

You guys hate on some of the board members selling on Friday but they may have done this on purpose to wave the 10% flag for the whole world to see. The 10% rule triggering uptick rule actually applies intraday as well but not all are aware of this and while awareness of GME is good now, not everyone has their eye on the intraday chart.

Have faith. BofA and Melvin are big boys but now with the 10% flag raised high and proud, the whole world of smart money is getting ROCK HARD.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 **🐻 🌈** are **FUK**🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Oh yeah, one more thing. The Melvin underling also wrote "There's contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down" **this was a dead give away.** The data was out on the 15th. It went way up. Shorts doubled down but they are close to tapping out.

It's like when you go to a casino you bet 1, you lose, so you bet 2, you lose, you bet 3, you lose you bet 6.... etc etc to recoup losses. You feel me? Right now they are at hundreds of millions. They might not have enough money to play the next round hence the desperate shilling moves on WSB. Don't fall for it.

Remember. No matter how big the big boys are, this is going to be a big blow for them.

**Positions**: Shares and calls. I took profit on the pop and with that I'm gonna be loading up more on shares and calls at about 7:3 ratio.🚀

**p.s** I haven't forgotten, you guys seemed to have liked the 'distribution points' and 'used consumer electronics' angles of my previous DDs but there's more. WAY MORE. I will put the Stadia/digital console argument to rest next.

**p.p.s** I'm not saying Tuesday will be the squeeze, just saying, it's net bullish and you can smell the shorts fear now, so anything can happen._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is WSB Really in Control?: A GME Thought Experiment I've heard a lot of rumblings of WSB autists being the new market makers and us having control over the market now, but many of us may ask ourselves, is that really true? Below is a thought experiment to help quantify this discussion using the current example of GME. If ur retarded and can't read theres a TLDR at the bottom and a couple rocket emojis. 🚀🚀🚀

I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor, don’t take any advice from me, I’m autistic and like to play out scenarios in my head while I wait for my tendies to cook.

We will begin with a quick history lesson on the [VW short squeeze](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/). Everyone seems to compare this GME situation with the VW short squeeze but how similar are they? The short answer is that on paper they are not similar, but in reality they could be.

-VW was viewed as high probability bankruptcy candidate, and as such had a short interest of 12.8% of outstanding shares in October 2008. **That's not a lot**. Short interest is the number of shares sold short ("borrowed") that have not yet been covered or closed out. Compare that to GME which as of 1/15 apparently has [138% short interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyp0q3/gme_short_interest_update_13808/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link). So that's it right? Game over because GME has more short interest so its a bigger squeeze than VW? No, not exactly.

See, its easy to avoid a short squeeze when there are shares available to close the position, VW shorts could have easily closed out a measily 12.8% of outstanding shares since in October of 2008 only ~55% of VW shares were unavailable. At the time, Porsche already owned 30% of VW shares, Lower Saxony owned 20%, and various indexes owned 5%. That left 45% of shares available and only 12.8% needed to cover. **But then** under the noses of VW shorts, Porsche announced over the weekend that they had increased their stake by an additional 44% of shares, meaning that 99% of VW shares were unavailable: only 1% of shares were left and shorts had needed 12.8% of the shares to close their position. **Thats Bad and Thats What Sent The Shorts Scrambling to Cover**. Later that week VW shares peaked at 1000€. What is interesting here, is that the shorts weren't even acting irrationally, they were just unaware of the extent to which shares were unavailable until it was too late.

Now lets compare this to GME. Previous estimates of the quantity of GME shares unavailable can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), and [here](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote). For simplicity we will use Morningstar's estimate: GME has a float of 27.29 million shares, which means that all but 27.29 million shares are tied up due to insiders and institutions. So ~39% of shares are available, that's less than VW before Porsche upped their stake but with far greater short interest.

Now here is when the thought experiment really begins, and we transition from a history lesson to math class.

So VW shorts got pinned in a situation where only 1% of shares were available but they had 12.8% of shares outstanding. GME shorts are in a position where 39% of shares are available and they have 138% of shares outstanding. So a short squeeze certainly seems on the horizon, but the ratio of shares available and shares needed to cover isn't as extreme as VW. **But what would happen if less shares became available?**

Well if Ryan Cohen purchases the remaining 7% (~4.9 million) of shares that hes allowed, the shares available would drop to 32%, further polarizing  the ratio.

**But this is what I want you to think about**. Float (shares available) does not account for retail investors because the consensus is that we are paper handed bitch bois and are apt to easily sell our holding. **What if that wasn't true?**

WSB (retail investors) has 1.9 million members, if we all **hold** an average of 1 share each, the true shares available would drop to 29.4%. If we **hold** an average of 3 shares each, then shares available drops to 24%. With an average of 5 shares each, shares available becomes 18.5%. 10 shares each, only 5% of shares are left available.

So VW had a ratio of 1% of shares available to 12.8% outstanding (12.8x). Currently, we are sitting at ~39% available with ~138% outstanding (3.5x). If Cohen ups his stake we get 32% available and 138% outstanding (4.3x). To match the VW ratio, there would need to be ~10.8% of shares available with the 138% outstanding (12.8x). For that to happen it would mean that WSB alone has to **hold** an average of 8 shares per member to expect a squeeze of similar strength as the VW squeeze. 

How far can this thought experiment go though? What if GME had only 1% of shares available just like VW did? Well, for that to happen it would mean that WSB **holds** an average of 11.25 shares, and that would get a ratio of, well, 138x.

So you guys do the math, is retail really in control here? It's looking like a maybe. To conclude this thought experiment I will present you with a hypothesis that will either prove or disprove this theory:

If retail investors can hold their shares and reduce the available float, then they have control over the market. (in this particular example)

The hypothesis is proved if retail investors can cooperate and act as an institution, taking enough shares out of circulation.

The hypothesis will fail if retail investors do not take shares out of circulation and have no control over the float.

Now this is a thought experiment so I have to provide some realistic criticism for you to accurately judge the situation. Ryan Cohen has no obligation to buy the additional 7%, but the consensus is that it seems likely. WSB may not have 1.9 million users who are active, bullish, and dedicated to holding, and they certainly may not have an average of 8+ shares each, this is less likely but possible. 

**I am not a financial advisor, I am retarded like you guys, do not take this thought experiment as the word of god. Furthermore, I am not advocating that ever member here go and buy 10 shares of GME to force a squeeze, this is simply a way to explain the mechanisms behind the VW short squeeze and compare them to the current GME situation. Do your own research and make an educated decision on whether or not you believe GME is a wise investment.**

TLDR: Thought Experiment: A lot of people have talked about how VW had a Porsche that made the squeeze so extreme and we don’t necessarily have a Porsche. But what if this time... we’re the Porsche?

if VW squeeze hard cuz very few shares available and too many shares shorted, but GME only have moderate shares available and way too many shares shorted, then if GME only have very few shares available that mean GME squeeze hard too.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎✋🏻_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME | This Cycle Biggest Value Trap | How Retails Will Lose All Their Money | Bear Case I will argue that GME is a value trap because it has no virtuous cycle to improve cash flow as its business model has been disrupted by the digital transformation of online video game sales and discounts. GME is set to default in the next 8 months without further cash infusion.

# Business Model

GME high margins has always been reselling popular titles. They buy low and sell high for popular titles. This has worked in the past but the tipping point had arrived in 2019 \[1\] putting severe pressure in the old business model.

In the next generation console, online purchases will continue to be dominant. Moreover, when popular titles become less popular, they are heavily discounted online, incentivizing consumers to find deals online rather than holding on to physical media.

This compression in its high margin and sharp drop in foot traffic to drive sales will continue to impair cash flow in the future, leading to a solvency problem.

Lastly, the previous console generation had been saturated. It’ll be unsustainable for GME to depend on customer selling and buying previous console titles.

# Competitor Advantage

There has been excitement about Ryan Cohen trying to transform GME to an online business. But the competitor moats are too big to overcome. Microsoft and Sony own game studios and will continue to offer better deals on their online platform. There is no way for GME to compete with these monopolistic moats.

It is important to note that Blockbuster tried to shift online once it realize that Netflix had disrupted its business model. Blockbuster was unsuccessful because of Netflix’s first move advantage, ability to raise large debt, and operate at massive losses at scale to undercut Blockbuster move online.

A similar environment is facing GME as it plans its online pivot. Microsoft and Sony have massive cash reserves and at scale, and lower marginal operating costs compared to GME online business. Moreover, they control studios and can offer their exclusives first buying opportunities on their platforms before sales move to secondary platforms.

# Value Trap

GME has no virtuous cycle. Unlike Blue Apron that was able to improve cash flow because of the pandemic and people buying meal kits, or TSLA improving production and selling more green credits to improve production, GME has no virtuous cycle.

Market analysis indicates there is a structural shift to online buying and online platform to provide heavily discounted prices of popular titles once their popularity wanes.

I will argue that GME business model is similar to Blockbuster after it was disrupted by Netflix. GME is in a death spiral, unable to compete against Microsoft or Sony.

# Cash Flow Problems

GME operating loss in October 2020 was 184M. They had 450M in cash \[2\] at the end of October. This implies a runway of 2-3 quarters in which they need to raise cash or face default.

# Short Squeeze Mania Explained

Much excitement has been made about a possible short squeeze against Melvin Capital. People point to the recent 100% rise in GME to argue for a short squeeze. Much discussion has been made of it so I won’t add to it, except to offer another explanation, focusing on MM and delta hedging.

As rumours about an infinite short squeeze on GME rose, a sharp rise in call option buying occurred. MM as part of their delta hedges would need to buy up shares. However encountering few shares to buy MM started buying ITM calls, and moving to OTM calls. This led to higher prices and MM needing to further buy shares and call options to delta hedge. So the steep rise in price wasn’t from Melvin Capital but MM delta hedging. Furthermore, realizing the risky positions MM had taken as part of delta hedging (imperfect hedges) they decided to eliminate GME margins to slow down the gamma convexity

Therefore it is the MM that had been buying shares and not Melvin Capital. This is supported by the early evidence that Shorts took on more shorts/puts as the price went up.

# Conclusion

GME is at risk of default in 6-8 months and a short squeeze may not come. ***In fact what may be happening is that retails have entered a massive value trap that will cause them to lose most of their investment should GME continue to face a cash crunch on weak sales/massive operating cash flow losses over the next 8 months without a huge cash injection***. Even then their business model is structurally problematic.  **The risk of default is very high but retails are ignoring this in hope of a short squeeze.**

Ask yourself, would you have invested in Blockbuster when you heard it was moving its business online?

However, I have been long GME since 6$ thanks to Jeffamazon's amazing DD a while back. However, if you have been in it since then, you would remember how GME always:

1. Reaches new all time high's 
2. Immediately tanks back down (always remains higher then where it first mooned)
3. Consolidates for a week or two.
4. Moons again to an even greater ATH.

Point is, I see way too much expectation building for next week where I'm fairly certain its going to tank back down into the lower 30's based purely on how it has behaved before, and I worry that all this positive bias will be detrimental when it makes people paperhand. Just keep in mind all the fantastic DD that has been posted before and hold strong through the dip. That being said, it would be fantastic if it squeezed next week, but I'm not counting on it.

TLDR: GME will squeeze for sure, but I doubt it's happening as soon as this week. Don't paperhand your shares like a bitch if it dips. For the extra autistic:

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB vs. The World 🚀🚀.🚀 Lets Go! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Froth Boiled After $600 Checks. Now $1,400 May Be Coming. Rocket fuel is on its way! Hold steady. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Canadian Solar (CSIQ) is great and should have a huge year in 2021 You might have seen me mention them in the daily threads. In November I did an earnings play and bought calls.  CSIQ flew under the radar of a lot of people and I thought it could have a huge earnings beat. I bought a 38c a few weeks prior for the end of the month. Stock was trading at the mid to high 30s. Well their earnings was a massive beat. 914 million dollars in revenue and beat the eps estimates by 162.50%.  The stock climbed to the mid 40s. 

Since then it has reached the mid 50s with an all time high of 59.18. 

 CSIQ currently has p/e ratio of only 14.75 while other similar solar companies have a p/e ratio of 40 to a p/e ratio of 2683 


Simply put, canadian solar is undervalued especially compared to it's peers 

The consensus revenue estimate of $4.93 billion for 2021 represents indicates 43.6% increase year-over-year. Its EPS is expected to grow 20.4% in 2021. Yep, nearly 5 billion in revenue expected in 2021. They are already off to a good start.

Canadian Solar Subsidiary Recurrent Energy Completes Sale and Breaks Ground on the Slate Project, Expected to Be One of the Largest PV + Battery Storage Projects in the U.S. They also sold huge solar projects in Italy, Hungary, Australia, and Texas these past few weeks.


Next earnings report is estimated to be end of March. Im gonna be looking at calls for a little after that. Ill be buying more shares on the bigger dips, probably under 50 a share Ill load up.

Analysts expect that Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ) will report $997.33 million in sales for the current quarter, according to Zacks.

Barney Citigroup began coverage on shares of Canadian Solar in a research note on Friday, January 8th.

Oh and 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB Survival Guide 🚀 (with sound) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA severely undervalued at current market prices Hello. APHA and TLRY have announced a merge as I am sure everyone know. When they merge they will go under ticker "TLRY" and for every APHA share you own you will receive .838 TLRY shares. Currently APHA is $12.42 and TLRY is $19.70. Meaning if they were to merge today APHA would be worth $16.50, but its trading for only 75% of that value. So APHA is quite undervalued in the current market and I see no reason to buy TLRY instead of APHA.

TLDR - APHA  🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You bastards made the Barron’s _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Before I leave, I'd like to say one last thing... I  want to start this off by saying you guys are my heroes. I fully  support everything you do, as long as you don't paper hand GME. Keep  making memes and tendies and memes about tendies forever. But it's  important to acknowledge this isn't for everyone. So lay off the guys at  [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).  They're just putting away money they make into something with better  than banks, which thanks you for letting them make billions of dollars  with your money by giving you 0.001% of what they make with it. They're  doing fine for themselves and sometimes I wish I was more like them.I'd  like to state for the record that I was once one of you. Up 300% in  September off of TQQQ weeklies. It was fucking great. I actually got  back the 90% I lost on the Great Pump and Dump of 2017 (can't say which one, cause of the 1B rule, but it rhymes with Shmelios and Shmatheson) and then  some! I was going to be one of the few who turn 2k into 2M in a year, I  just knew it. I was picking out yachts already and I was *finally*  going to live my dream of starting a business. Had to do more research,  keep checking WSB and the financial sheets, have to find the next big  play.  Which was GME of course. I doubled that again right as it popped  up to $22 in December, up 600% this year. Almost had my first 10k, it  just had to hit $25. Had to always check watch it, cause if you miss a  big move, you could miss out.  So of course, my 25c'sexpired worthless.  Down 50% now.

This is where it  hooks you. You know you're right, you just have to give it one more go.  But you have to check your phone right now in case you miss the big  event. One last try, more money, you'll make it big. I bought 1/22  $20c's right before the ICR conference, it literally couldn't go tits  up. Just had to keep watching to see if what they say is good or bad.  Had to watch the stock too, to see how people react. Had to watch after  hours, cause someone might place a big order at 11:30 at night when you  can't sleep cause you're thinking about GME. 

But  they never did. They never presented. Down 75%. Maybe it was too good  to be true and the Tendie McTendface would never be mine. Didn't work  all day to watch the market until 3:50pm on Tuesday, decided I was done.  Can't do it anymore, my stomach hurts and I hate this, I'm out. 10:00am  Wednesday, would have had all my debts paid off and at least a small  canoe with the 35K that those options were worth. Now the dread and the  FOMO and the self loathing kick in. I'm just now pulling myself up  enough to say that I really truly am out.

I  know I missed out big, but there's always another GME. I know it's not too late to get int. There's always people making money and people losing money. I could have bought Tesla at $30 or the electronic currency that shall not be named in 2011. And maybe  some day when I have a real job and less credit card debt I'll come back  and blow stacks on ARKG calls, who knows?  But not this time. This isn't for  everybody. You can always make money, but you can't make sanity or time.  I know a lot of people on reddit are prone to anxiety and depression  and nothing triggers dangerous behavior like giving an depressed and  broke young guy the opportunity to solve all his problems by putting his  financial security, or lack thereof, in the hands of a largely  unpredictable market entirely outside his control. This shit gets  addicting real easily, and I applaud those who can handle it and make it  out on top, but just remember it's not for everyone. I saw a post where  someone was asking for help about trading addiction and got laughed out  for being a paper handed bitch. Don't be that guy. 

Please  just remember, this isn't supposed to take over your life. Yes, you can  make $100k a year if you're really good and all you have to do is click  some buttons and wait. Most people I know, if offered a job that paid  $100k and "all they had to do" was constantly be agitaed and anxious and  stare at numbers on a screen hoping you didn't make another stupid  decision you stupid idiot I hate you you're always wrong and you're  going to drive everyone away because of it... You get the point. I  wouldn't take that job no matter how much you paid me.So be nice to the  guys over at [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/),  they're just trying to do good for themselves. And remember you can  turn your phone settings "invert colors" and hold it upside down if you  want a green line going up.

I still don't understand [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/) though. Are those guys serious? Is that like a real thing? You made 15 cents this week? Great, get a job... idiots.

TL;DR: GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 and be nice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A $GME Story Cont'd this Tuesday. (First video submission sorry if bad D:) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Making a statement _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (GME DD) One DD to rule them. One DD to find them. One DD to to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. # Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about "blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having "Digital game exchanging" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying "omnichannel" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout "DigITaL" or "BlOCKbuSTER" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts "blockbuster" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now for the data for this week:

[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to 💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down "Short squeeze has happend" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

>There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

“In this retail-driven market this defense is not working. Almost all of our “sold to retail” stocks are going up simultaneously because the market is driven by the least sophisticated gamblers we have seen in markets in our professional lifetimes. So rather than shrinking one-or-two stocks (as per normal risk management practice for us) we have been forced to cut large numbers of shares across many sectors.
This means that collectively we have spent over USD100 million buying back stock we think is worthless. We are appalled”

This is a post reminding you that you need to know when to get off the rocket. 

If you look at the short squeeze of VW in 2008 you'll see the massive spike... and then a slightly higher trading price than before. If you think you'll get off at the peak, you're wrong. Some will, but most won't. 

You'll probably be too busy massaging your wife's bull or driving to the store to pick up more of his condoms to notice that the spike happened. It lasted for a day. 

You will watch the price go up and up, think about all the lambos you will buy, and when you check robinhood again... you missed it. The price never reached 420.69. Maybe it hit 420.54. Or 419.73. And you fucking missed it. 

Maybe your strategy is to take a week off of work and keep your eyes on the stock. Maybe you have a trailing stop set. Maybe you're just along for the ride and plan on taking gains after the spike.

TLDR: buy and hold🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME - possible scenarios, FOMO and exit plans. TL;DR - No. You will have to read this one. It took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you. But personally I'm a GME believer and it WILL fly 🚀. 

So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded. The answer is yes, yes you are. But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard. If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings. 
  
There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore. This is why I decided to put this together. You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang. I entered GME in January at $19, paper handed in worst possible moment at $32 because I thought squeeze has sqoze. I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME. Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a) I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b) apparently no one else is willing to do it properly.  
    
So here it goes from the worst case to the best. All possible scenarios I can think of. If I miss anything or I messed something up, please let me know and I will update this list. This is not a financial advice. You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read, do your own research.   
  
##**"WE ARE FUCKED!" scenarios:**  
  
***Ryan Cohen played us all (EDIT: it appears this scenario is impossible. Leaving this up as another proof that I am indeed retarded.)***  
In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares. We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump. We are all royally fucked.  

For this scenario:   
  
* RC, despite what you can read around here, is not your actual daddy. He is a business man looking to make profit.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* RC is fucking rich and if he wanted, he could already retire. 
* It would ruin his credibility.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares, price reaches near 0 within minutes. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Near zero chance this happens. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is very low.  
   

***GME is practically bankrupt***  
It turns out that RC comes in too late. GME is bankrupt in few months.  

For this scenario:   
  
* That was shorters play from the beginning.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* According to DD posted by people on WSB, GME books look good.  
* New console cycle, stimulus money, post COVID optimism all point that GME should be afloat longer then we need them to.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that GME is in a very bad condition. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Very low chance that this happens due to againsts. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is 0.  
   
***Shorters pull a fast one on us***  
In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions, outplay options and wait out long positions.  
  
For this scenario:   
  
* They have written the rules of the game and honestly, they know much better how to play it then us. 
  
Against this scenario:  
  
* If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in options last Friday.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions.   
* Price falls in following days below $20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time.  

  
My personal opinion:  
  
* Non-zero chance this happens. It is possible. But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already. PT: uncertain but definitely below $20. $10-$15 if I had to guess.   
   
##**Neutral scenarios:**   
  
***We are in a deadlock aka. "neutral but actually bad"***  
In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands. Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease. Both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months.    
 
For this scenario:  
  
* Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts. And they will not admit defeat.
* Shorts have more money and patience.
* If shorts are replaced by new ones, they will not bleed (but that's unlikely).  
* We believe, but a lot of us have paper hands and/or can't afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out.  
* Hype will die down and with it our conviction.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money.  
* If the price remains low ($30 or below), there *may* come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment. This would trigger good scenarios.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. 
  
My personal opinion:  

* Honestly I'm mostly afraid of this scenario. But at the same time it's not very likely that shorts are replaced. Then again, if nothing major happens relativly soon, this is still a likely scenario. PT: $25-$30 for months to come until one side wins.
   
***We are in a deadlock aka. "neutral but actually good"***  
In this case price volatility slowly decreases, and both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months. But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity. Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions.   
 
For this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money and will be covering their shorts.  
* One should never underestimate autists.   
  
Against this scenario:  

* United retards with diamond hands? Retail investors are market makers? I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. But the trend will become upward after that.
  
My personal opinion:  

* Hard to say. I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one.  
   
 
##**Good scenario:**  
  
***Slow and steady short squeeze***  
We win! Shorts are out of ammo, Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position. GME begins it's burn to the moon!
  
For this scenario:  

* Shorts are already kind of fucked.  
* Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong.  
* GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit.  
* Any good news will make this only more likely (like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position).  
  
Against this scenario:  

* Like I said before, we don't exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve.  
* If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced.   
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions.  
  
My personal opinion:  

* It's likely and this is my bet. PT: very hard to say but could be anywhere between $60 and $200 or even way more in next weeks or months.   
   
##**Mother of all Short Squeezes**  
   
***We make history***  
It turnes out RC actually is your father. In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked. They will sing songs about us.  
   
For this scenario:  

* All of the "good scenarios" fors, but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life. 
  
Against this scenario:  

*  RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20% shares and while float is low compared to shorts, it's not enough for MOASS.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price opens at $200 or $400 and only goes up. Sorry FOMO guys, the rocket missed the Moon is already past Jupiter.  
   
My personal opinion:  
  
* I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday, but I honestly give this maybe 10% chance of happening. PT: a random number between $420.69 and infinity.   
   
##**Dear FOMO guys**  
If you decide that GME hype is not empty and that the Moon is within reach, please buy non leveraged shares. Margin, leverage or options could fuck you up short term even if in the end we win. 
    
##My position:  
254 long shares at $35.90, 205 leveraged shares at $36.48 (most protected down to $23, considering protecting them even more).

I saw several posts about $NOK last week. It looks like since $BB is waking up, some retards start to lurk at others telecom companies. I saw an autist talking about NOKIA (Ticker: NOK), saying that it was a very autistic bet. I start to get interested into it. Here is my small DD for you fuckers.

# History:

Ok so NOKIA was at one time one of the greatest company in the world, and leader manufacturer of mobile phones. They initially started with tires and rubber shits in the 19th century (!!!), then they went into telecom, bringing them at some point at the top of the world where they use to represent 4% of the total Finnish GDP by themselves. Everybody knows the fucking solid rock Nokia 3310 phones, the most solid phone ever made that you could throw from a 10 story building and still recover functional. I actually still own one which still works.

In 2007, they sold their phone manufacturing branch to Microsoft, because those motherfuckers wanted to step a foot in the smartphone market. They rebranded the name “Nokia Phones” to “Microsoft Phones”, and they fucked up pretty bad. Since the name NOKIA was not used anymore, they disappeared from the mind of people. And since Microsoft Phones were extremely shitty, Microsoft sold Nokia Phones to HMD Global, another Finnish company founded by former NOKIA employees. The thing is that HMD Global is paying a license to NOKIA to use their name again. Their phones are pretty good, essentially sold on the Indian market. So NOKIA here is just selling the name for HMD Global phones. They also plan to do it for laptops and tablets.

# What does NOKIA do know ?

**So the NOKIA that we are talking about does not make phones anymore (like $BB)**. They are however extremely active in the 5G market and pioneering the 6G transition. Since Huawei disappeared from that market in Western countries, **NOKIA signed at shit load of contracts with tens of countries and airports for implementing 5G networks everywhere**, just look at their Yahoo Finance page [NOKIA.HE 3.3525 -0.0300 -0.89% : Nokia Corporation - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOKIA.HE?p=NOKIA.HE&.tsrc=fin-srch). Several months ago, they announced to have signed a contract with M**OTHER FUCKING NASA in order to produce a system for implementing 4G network on the Moon** ([Nokia selected by NASA to build first ever cellular network on the Moon | Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/))   S**O YES NOKIA IS LITERRALLY ALREADY ON THE MOON !!!!  I consider this as a proof that what NOKIA** is proposing  is of very good quality. Because they cannot fuck up that contract.

Also just last week, they announced to have a **signed contracts with Google Cloud, T-Mobile and the US Federal National Cybersecurity Center** of Excellence for their 5G Cybersecurity projects, in collaboration with NIST\*\*. SO not only NOKIA received the blessing from NASA, but also from the US Government !\*\*

# The armed wing  of Nokia: NOKIA BELL LABS

In 2016, NOKIA acquired the Bell Labs company. You do not know what Bell Labs is ?

Listen up boys: **The Bell Labs is one of the most innovative company in world. Technology as we know it right now would not exist without Bell Labs**. The phone and the computer that you are using right now to read those lines and make fucking money with meme stocks used transitors right ? You know that the first ever transitor has been made in Bell Labs ? And the also the LASER ( the thing does light beams and pew pew in sci-fi movies) ? And almost all the telecom technologies that one uses everyday ? These guys have a shit load of heritage in telecom that no other company has. Bell Labs gave birth to an outstanding number of Nobel prizes. They are one of the company in the world who produced the most patents. And all of this now is embedded in the NOKIA Corporation. **This is thanks to Bell Labs, that NOKIA is pioneering 6G.**

# Problem is: NOKIA is literally a GIANT

Yes, NOKIA is a well established company, with very low volatility. With their almost 5 billion outstanding shares, moving up this fat ass boy will require a shit ton of volume. They bottomed pretty hard last year when they announced a reduction of their margins in order to invest in their 5G technology. Since then, Nokia went up, slowly, but steady. I sincerely think that they cannot go lower, unless they fucked up their contracts. But since they are backed up by the US, NASA, and a shit load of other countries, I sincerely think this is very unlikely to happen. NOKIA will give its Q4 earning report next month, we will see what this could bring us. But I am expecting a nice catalyst here.

&#x200B;

# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS ONLY MY OPINION. DO YOUR OWN DD.

**TL;DR:**  Ticker is NOK : A giant is starting a new awakening with their 5G technology, trusted by NASA themselves and the US government temselves. NASA is bringing them straight to the Moon. But the move may be slow. This is not a weekly play 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

 $5c Jan 22 + shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There probably is no market bubble burst in the near future - here's why Yo retards. I study finance and economics and today I've been reading about macro indexes for comapnies. It's nothing new I just thought someone may learn new from this and I also consolidate my knowledge doing that.

We see massive amount of  headlines saying "the burst is behind the corner!1one1" on daily basis. If you take a look at most popular economy measures, everything is alright. Let's analyze it together:

1. GDP - US GPD per capita is still raising. There was a dip in 2008 and Q1 2020 for obvious reasons. Now we see rising trend and analysts estimate it to keep raise at least for the next few years. The simple rule says that if the GPD drops for 2 quarters or more the recession is coming. 🚀🚀🚀

2. Unemployment - it went up drastically last March but it has improved by 8% already. The trend is more important in unemployment, than the numbers itself the chart flattened in Dec but it still doesn't indicate recession in any means. 🚀🚀

**GameStop (GME)**

**Bear Thesis**

* Game console cycle in 2020
   * Boost in revenue due to new console cycle is temporary
   * Low margin on distributing game consoles
   * Main profit margin comes from software and virtual goods
* Brick & mortar is dying due to digitalization of gaming
   * Largest profit center for Gamestop is pre-owned and value video game
   * High revenue but low profit on new video game hardware and software sales
   * Gaming market is moving towards online game download instead of physical discs (Steam, Riot, Gaming Consoles)
   * It’s a matter of time game console manufacturers do not need them for distribution or service centers for their hardware
* Microsoft deal
   * A share of Microsoft Xbox’s digital revenue goes to Gamestop
   * Revenue share unannounced
   * What’s next after the multi-year deal end?
   * Revenue share does not include pre-owned console sales
* Continued closing of physical stores
   * Signifies accelerated closing of business
   * Directors taking profits after record week
   * Older board members sold part of their shares to profit after the record week
      * /u/Invisible0815 pointed out " board members most likely sold because they will not stand for re-election in june. AND they didnt sell all their shares. one member had to sell because of his own funds regulations. i bet u, he didnt want to sell (hestia capital, he should be on cohens side cause he hates old management). "

&#x200B;

* Bull case counterarguments from /u/baystreetdegenerate
   * Nintendo next game console in 2022
      * Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases
      * **OP's reply**: Current generation of consoles are still being traded at GameStop, which is one of their revenue stream
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
      * Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much
      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
      * That's what youtube is for...
      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.
      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?
      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.
   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce
      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?
      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.
   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21
      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue

**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.

Why ON semiconductor (Ticker: ON) is a good play.

**What does ON do?**

From wikipedia: **ON Semiconductor** is a semiconductor supplier company, formerly in the [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500), but dropping into the [Fortune 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_1000) in 2020. Products include power and signal management, logic, discrete, and custom devices for 🚀automotive🚀, communications, computing, consumer, industrial, LED lighting, medical, military/aerospace and power applications. ON Semiconductor runs a network of manufacturing facilities, sales offices and design centres in🚀 North America🚀, Europe, and the Asia Pacific regions. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, ON Semiconductor has revenues of $3.907 billion (2016), which puts it among the worldwide top 20 semiconductor sales leaders.

So basically they make chips and stuff.

Over the past few years, they have acquired semiconductor manufactures and silicon manufacturers from TESLA (Not the TSLA one, this one is a formerly state sponsored Czechoslovak company.

They have manufacturing facilities in Canada (1), USA (6 currently and building one more I think), Belgium, Czech republic, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines and Vietnam. 

&#x200B;

**This stock so lame, how does it go up?**

**Recently, as a result of both Covid-19 factory shutdowns and the EV boom, there has been a major unreported lack of chips used to make cars.**🚀

&#x200B;

[Don't take my word for it](https://preview.redd.it/ya7a6v2jdub61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f18a6e50f0ae6176ab0da3178b980fa5aef74ae)

Once I heard of this, I looked around to find the stock that could benefit from this the most. I found ON semiconductor. They are one of the largest makers of Car semiconductors. The only companies larger than them are already either well known or overpumped (For example Tesla). 

Basic economic rules of supply and demand. Supply go down. Demand go up. Price go up. Money. Yay.

**Ok cool so they make something that lots of people want. What else?**

They are having a Earnings report on February 1st. Based on what I have seen I think they are going to crush expectations. This is one of the many catalysts that could cause it to go up. 🚀

&#x200B;

TLDR: ON semiconductor (ON) is:

🚀Covid Recovery play

🚀EV play

🚀Earnings Report Play

🚀Semiconductor Play

🚀Logical

🚀Not at ATH

🚀Fundamentally sound

What’s your story?

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My DD on Palantir. Normally I don’t do this kind of thing, but I’ve had far too much wine, just enough weed, and I’m feeling kinda jolly this evening, so let me spit some knowledge for my fellow Retards about everyone’s favorite eye in the sky these days: Palantir. Demo Day is coming on Jan 26th, and leading up to that will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir’s is 🚀going 🚀to 🚀the 🍆fuckin’ 🌖moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This 🚀rocket’s about to blast off.

Palantir’s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&D projects. You don’t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.

Speaking of surveillance... let’s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y’all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)

If you don’t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she’s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn’t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that’s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife’in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn’t.

By the early 2000’s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that’s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)

That’s right, you heard me. The CIA.

Speaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.
“Daegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?” Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)

Now, wouldn’t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?

If this isn’t your next big play over the long term, I don’t know; you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.

Now, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You’re welcome.

EDIT;🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ While everyone was making tendies on GME... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME DD- Fundamentals: Why WSB Just Bought a Value Stock. I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I‘m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don’t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.

$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn’t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I’m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.

🐻 Case: 

1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  

The digital game sales argument, like all 🐻  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the 🐻 are right, but they’re right in 8 years which means they’re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more
people go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don’t care about the fractionally
larger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. 

Blockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster’s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster’s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.

Gamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  

Everyone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.

2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt

This is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.

3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.

Gamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.

Gamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a "digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment"

🐂 Case

This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  

This isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  

This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you’re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don’t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  

Simply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?


TLDR:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But not because of the MOASS.

Edit: I forgot I had 5000 shares in my YOLO account so position is actually 35,000 GME_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Was in for a while, then out, now currently back all in PLTR since genius MILF Cathy Wood deep dove in. All shares (clearly). Looking forward to keeping you guys posted. Should be an interesting week leading up to demo day. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amarin (AMRN) has a lot going for it. Amarin (AMRN) has been creaping up.  Last year it lost 76% of its value because a judge turned down its patent for its omega 3 cardiovascular medication. So generics could duplicate it and under cut them.

Vascepa is the name of the drug.

But soon the European Commission will be ruling on whether they approve of it.  Also Canada too.  And in China it is moving to phase 3.  

This drug, which is basically modified fish oil has been proven to dramatically reduce heart failure.  25-35 % reduction.  

Market cap: 4.6 billion
6.4% sold short.
Institutional ownership under 50%.
No side effects like anal leakage.
Potential to be a 10 billion dollar drug
Have lawsuits against the generics because the have a patented delivery system.
Was 4 and change two months ago and has moved up to 6+ presently.
600 million in cash , no debt.
Options are very inexpensive now.


 "New data from the REDUCE-IT clinical trial (REVASC analysis) presented at the American Society for Preventive Cardiology Virtual Summit on CVD Prevention showed that the administration of 4 g/day of Amarin's (NASDAQ:AMRN) Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) resulted in a 34% reduction in first coronary revascularizations compared to placebo (p<0.0001)."

Drugs are rarely this effective.

Had a blast browsing the last month, but my account is a month old so here we go. I learned a very hard lesson with Gamestop.  Super happy for everyone’s success and have enjoyed seeing all of the gains.  🚀🚀🚀

In true retard fashion, I bought 455 shares on December 24 at $21.97 and panicked when I dropped down $800 and ended up selling at a loss like a paper handed bitch. I thought, “Wow, I bought at the literal top and now it’s crashing” probably like some of you are now with BB.

Obviously this is my biggest regret so far in stocks and all I needed to do was BE PATIENT! Literally less than three weeks and I would’ve made over $10,000.  The market was awful Friday for all stocks.

I won’t make the same mistake again.  I agreed with the DD posts on GME and I do on BB as well.  Have patience, buy more shares if it goes down and do your research.

User commentary as replies to the messages below are encouraged. Report bugs to /u/zjz._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Margin Changes and their implications I initially wrote this as a comment but wanted to share it with the rest of you retards. There have been a lot of posts about GME this weekend but none have really gone into the implications of the [changes in margin requirements last week.](https://twitter.com/BooRileyMusic/status/1350159960877879296) This post gets long and rambly so up front **TLDR; retail shorts will be forced out creating upwards price pressure, but making the squeeze smaller and shorter** 

- The first question is, why are banks increasing margin requirements or removing margin altogether? 

There are two possible answers. Either the banks can't find the shares or they're trying to protect themselves from potential losses. Not being able to acquire shares seems unlikely, if that were the case we should be seeing low availability and high interest [which just isn't there.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) People assuming banks are worried about their clients money are wonderfully optimistic but woefully naïve. You can take your account from 100k to zero and the bank won't blink. What they're worried about is you taking your account from 100k to -100k. 

- The banks are protecting themselves. But from what? 

The longs, with 75% margin requirement, would have to take 75% losses before losses exceed their collateral, and after that their losses are capped. For a GME bull that entered at 35$ that means a share price of < $8.75. **Shorts, on the other hand, have their losses exceeding collateral at any price > $26.25 (assuming 35$ price) and are exposed to potentially unlimited losses.** So banks are exposed to far more risk from the short positions than the long ones.

- Banks are limiting their indirect exposure to shorts by restricting or removing client's margin. Why does this matter? Aren't most shorts institutional and not affected by margin requirements?

It's true, most of the short volume is big players, but there is a large amount of retail shorts as well. Not only will you have contrarians looking to capitalize off the correction, you'll have all the boomers and casual investors who see Cramer, CNBC, and SA articles predicting the fall. The assumption that most retail shorts are in puts I think is false. If you ask anyone on WSB they would probably make that play, but most retail investors aren't degenerate retards. Most are boomers who favor slow steady growth and get hard thinking about their 2% dividend from MCD. When they see Cramer railing millennials for taking some deadbeat stock through the roof, they log into fidelity or schwab and sell shares short. They're not on RH blowing their retirement on FD puts at 30+% premium.

- Boomers short. Banks restricting margin. What happens from here?

Last week we saw Schwab increase margin requirements first to 100% and then eliminated it altogether. Fidelity increased their requirements from 70 to 75%. Rumors are IBKR were planning to do the same. It's important to note that while removing margin does decrease bank's indirect short exposure, it has the possible effect of triggering a short squeeze if too many clients are forced to close their positions at once. That might explain why IBKR didn't end up changing their margin requirement on the same day as Schwab, and why these changes haven't been widely publicized by the banks themselves. So lets assume that banks take a gentle approach, progressively rising margin requirements before removing margin altogether. This forces some longs and shorts out of their positions over time as they become too high for the trader. But there's an interesting difference when the longs are forced to cover vs. the shorts. Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position. If I'm short 100 shares with 75% collateral and the requirement goes to 100%, and I close part of the position with my collateral, my margin requirement will decrease but my collateral will decrease by an equal amount. **This means that the traders who forced out of long margin positions will only have to close a portion of their position while those forced out of shorts will have to close the entire position.** Moreover, given the recent price increase, it's likely that on average the shorts will need to cover more collateral than the longs. So shorts are more likely to be in financial distress and will have to close larger proportions of their positions than longs. The overall effect is net buying. 

- Short squeeze intensifies. Retail shorts forced out.

At this point in the lifecycle of a short squeeze with the stock running to new highs you typically have more and more short pressure- old shorts double down, new shorts see Cramer having a seizure and get fomo, some retard checks RH and sees a giant green dildo he doesn't agree with. This can potentially start the lifecycle over, if a new catalyst can force this new generation of shorts out. **By limiting retail shorting, big banks are effectively turning off the gas for squeeze continuation down the line.** 

- What does that mean for you? What do you do with this info?

Whatever the fuck you want. GME will probably have some amount of upwards buying pressure this week as banks further restrict margin, the magnitude of which will be proportional to the volume of retail shorts. Combined with /u/unlucky-prize's [prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) of volatility due to gamma hedging, I'm betting it's going to be a hell of a week. 

Positions: short 35p 3/19, 35p 4/16, 60p 1/29, long spread 50-60c 3/19

EDIT: Forgot 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Just to clarify, I would love to give a more precise prediction, but I don't think it's possible without knowing the volume of retail shorts. The best answer I can give is that the effect is >0._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Roblox is not a good investment (from an ex-employee) 1. We only did extremely high sales because of the pandemic, you can say good bye to the high ass revenues from kids buying robux once the pandemic is over.
2. Some employees have been in shit in the past for being pedophiles

Heres a screenshot of one of the DMs an employee had with a 14 year old

Been advised that this post wouldn't get me in trouble with the SEC if I removed certain parts and I have done so now so feel free to shoot questions.

3) The stock is overpriced as fuck, in march, our share price was $6.34, the fact we had Series H funding at a share price of $45 doesn't mean anything, we are definitely NOT worth 29.5B... You don't get from 7B to 29.5B in a few months 

4) Some kids got into our internal tools a few months ago , there's an MSN article on it too.

5) Some kids  also got into our internal tools back in 2016, we are not safe platform

6) If you work at Roblox, don't expect to be safe. I wish I took a principal software engineer position elsewhere like Discord. Most of us get doxxed, harassed, etc.

7)  Roblox investigates kids who get into their systems, does this seem appropriate? Maybe you should fucking work on securing them. I remember a month before the incident this year I advised them to switch to an SSO instead, like OneLogin or Okta, and they of course didn't. But now have AFTER the incident, why not just do it before fucking idiots

8) \*removed so I don't get sued\*

9) We make losses every year and have never profited.

Finally , we have some useless shit called UGC  we are literaly giving free money to greedy teens to make hats and etc

How can there be a short squeeze with 1.3 million share that can be shorted from IBKR alone?  And according to this the mean borrowing rate as 9.4% on 1/14/21 and 7.2% on 1/15/21.  That's a far cry from the 30% rate posted in other threads.  What am I missing???

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, "where the fuck else would I put my money?" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities and real estate.

So this play, another boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds "duh", except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even a skilled executive could pivot. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBY specifically](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/financial-info/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14535249). Let's get into it:

Upside:

* BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

* They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

* Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. [The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand](https://www.pennlive.com/business/2020/12/ps5-xbox-series-xs-soon-to-be-restocked-online-at-best-buy.html). That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

* They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

* Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because [they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2021-earnings.html). Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

* Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, [CEO Corie Barry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/01/21/best-buy-ceo-corie-barry-is-a-corporate-iconshes-now-accused-of-having-an-inappropriate-affair-with-a-co-worker/?sh=47abb92f5ce4) is a traditional "okay" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.

So let's recap so far:

* An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

* Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's "brick and mortar" expectations online.

Retarded play: Just buy shares if you're scared

Autistic play: **BBY** 2/26 $120-130c or near their ATHs. Also ROCKET SHIP EMOJI_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
