Hi. I am kind of new to Options and Warrants, so I have this here question: For me, a buyer, what are the practical differences that directly affect me between Options and Warrants?

I have looked up the differences and I know there are definitely many, but to me as a buyer, does it matter? Both give me the right to buy or sell a specific stock at a certain price. Is there a difference in the way the strike price or delta is calculated? I haven't found an explanation to that which I can understand properly.

Simple question, I'm trying to find through Forex VES/EUR or VES/USD to trade but it seems impossible. Is it normal that it cannot be trade anymore or did I just miss something?

I'm new to investing in stocks, I got very lucky with my first purchase and bought a Tesla stock in August before it split and now doubled my money. 

Since it's being added to the S+P 500 does that mean it will become more stable or is it still considered overvalued and volatile?

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.3% ahead of a short trading session, with markets scheduled to close at  1 p.m. ET . The blue- chips index earlier this week breached the 30000 milestone for the first time in its history, before sliding down on Wednesday. Trading was suspended Thursday for the  Thanksgiving  holiday.

Contracts linked to the  S&P  500 rose 0.3%, suggesting that the broad-market gauge may erase its tepid loss from Wednesday. The index had climbed to a record Tuesday.

Major technology stocks, in particular, are poised to extend a rally that sent the Nasdaq Composite to its 44th record closing level of 2020 on Wednesday. Futures linked to the Nasdaq-100 index advanced 0.4% Friday.

Markets have been buoyant this week despite rising coronavirus infection levels across the U.S. and economic data pointing to a halting recovery that may curb consumer confidence. Investors appear to be looking ahead to next year, betting that Covid-19 vaccines will curb the pandemic and allow social and business activity to return to normal.

"The hopefuls are leading the realists: they believe that the economy will return to an equilibrium with a high growth rate. They are looking beyond the shock," said  Sebastien Galy , a macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. " It's a matter of time though: there are still deep underlying issues with Covid spiking in the U.S."

The number of people hospitalized in the U.S. due to coronavirus surpassed 90,000 for the first time. More than 110,000 new cases were reported around the nation Thursday, sharply lower than totals in recent days. But infection levels are likely to rise again because of large gatherings and reunions for the  Thanksgiving Day  celebrations.

"There's still a lot of cases and restrictions in the U.S.: a lot of activity is going to stall again," said  Samy Chaar , chief economist at Lombard Odier. "This will have an impact potentially on the next job market report," he said, referring to labor-market figures for November that will be released on  Dec. 4 .

President Trump said Thursday that he would leave the  White House  if the electoral college backs  Joe Biden , further helping alleviate concerns about investors about political uncertainty in coming weeks. The president's campaign has lost several legal challenges that allege election fraud, and he has come under pressure from Republicans to accept the results.

"He lost big enough for this election to be very difficult to contest. It's a done deal for markets," said Mr. Chaar. "Everyone is working under the assumption that it will be a Biden administration."

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.860%, from 0.878% on Wednesday. The U.S. government-bond market was closed Thursday.

In commodities, copper rose over 2% on expectations that demand from  China  will increase and due to a recent fall in global inventories.

Meanwhile, Black Friday kicks off the traditional start of the crucial holiday shopping season in the U.S. Investors will be closely watching metrics such as e-commerce and mobility data to try to gauge consumer confidence and the extent that the pandemic and historically-high levels of unemployment will weigh on the retail sector.

"Given the difficult year for so many retailers, there's definitely going to be expectations for them to try to play catch up," said  Esty Dwek , head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Solutions. Black Friday "should give a nice bump to the \[economic data\] numbers."

Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.1%. The  U.K.  was the worst-performing stock market in  Europe  Friday, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index sliding 0.8%.

Talks between British and European Union negotiators on a trade deal continue, with both sides having just weeks, at best, to reach an agreement. The  U.K.  government also announced new restrictions on Thursday to stem the spread of the virus as infection levels remain elevated, with  England  split into tiers that determine the scope of limitations on activity.

"The uncertainty around Brexit and the tiers system that is slightly tougher, that is outweighing any vaccine optimism," said  Michael Hewson , a chief markets analyst at  CMC Markets .

In  Asia , most major stock benchmarks gained by the close of trading. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.1% and  Hong Kong's  Hang Seng Index added 0.3% . Profits at  China's  industrial firms in October rose over 28% from a year earlier, an acceleration from the 10% rise the previous month, in yet another sign of the strength of the country's recovery._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When does Vanguard / Blackrock/ETFs HAVE to have TESLA stocks by?

I am a noob investor trying to get into the field of value investing. I started my investing journey this June as I gained some cash as a joining bonus. My portfolios are up by 33% as of November and some of them actually reaching 52-week highs. So, I am in confusion regarding whether to sell them or not. The company has good growth potential (according to my analysis) and hence in all fair judgment, it makes sense to hold them longer (which was my initial plan).   
However, the current market capitalization in US (I am investing from CA) makes no sense to me. The stock valuation is going up where the economy (as well as Bond Yields) is going down. To me this indicates a possible future correction in the market.   
So, at this point, I am wondering should  I sell the stocks and wait for the stock market correction to buy them again or should I hold them.

But the person who engineered the windfall won't be getting a  Wall Street -style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn't play the market so much.

That's because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov.  Haruhiko Kuroda , head of  Japan's  central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan's  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the  Tokyo  stock market as a way of rousing the nation's animal spirits.

In March, he doubled the BOJ's annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of  $115 billion . That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year's low.

The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six- month period in its stock portfolio's gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly  $400 billion  as of  Sept. 30 , which represented an unrealized profit of  $56 billion  over what it paid.

Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.

The stock-buying program, which began under Mr. Kuroda's predecessor a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, isn't aimed at making trading profits. It is supposed to encourage broader risk-taking in the economy and ensure that prices are rising at a small and steady clip.

Recently, with inflation stuck around zero, some analysts are questioning whether the program is doing much good--especially during a pandemic, when other factors are weighing on the psychology of consumers and businesses.

Also, the central bank now owns more than 6% of the total value of the  Tokyo  stock market, leading some to wonder whether the premier symbol of capitalism could be undermined by state influence.

 NLI Research Institute  strategist  Shingo Ide  said the central bank's outsize role could hurt corporate governance because it can't act like other shareholders in monitoring company strategy and CEO performance.

"Because such a large unrealized profit means the bank's holdings are also getting bigger and bigger, there will likely be more demand from outside the BOJ to sell the stocks or start thinking about an exit policy," said Naomi Muguruma, an economist at  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities .

Ms. Muguruma said the BOJ would feel more comfortable starting such a discussion while it is sitting on profits.

The central bank doesn't directly buy individual stocks but invests in a swath of the market through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. It bought  $15 billion  in ETFs in March alone, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent months as the market recovers.

Mr. Kuroda said last week that he wasn't thinking of any quick changes in the program, with the stock market one of the bright signs for an economy that is only halfway back from its pandemic bottom.

"We need to prevent any market instability from causing a worsening of business and household confidence," Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary committee. " The BOJ's ETF purchases were effective in easing instability caused by the impact of coronavirus infections."

Still, there are signs that a rethink is in its early stages.  One  of the bank's nine policy board members, Takako Masai, said last week that the bank might have to consider tweaking its purchases and alluded to the uncomfortably large size of its holdings.

"It is necessary to have discussions pre-emptively to improve flexibility and nurture the market," said Ms. Masai, who used to work at a commercial bank.

A former  Bank of Japan  executive director,  Shigeki Kushida , said in a recent column in a publication for financial analysts that the BOJ could offer to sell its stocks to individual investors through financial firms rather than dumping the ETFs on the open market.

He said that method could avoid market confusion and encourage households to shift their savings into riskier assets from safe but zero-return bank accounts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale."*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

>*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

>*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

>\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

>*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.
