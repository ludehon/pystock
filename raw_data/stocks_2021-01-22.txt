[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/l2za6b)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Liquidity & Trading Volume of ETF -- $PSJ, $PTF Hi there! I was looking to buy about 15-20 shares of these 2 ETFs I came across. I was worried about  their low average daily trading volume:

1. [PSJ](https://www.etf.com/PSJ#overview) \- Around 26K shares daily
2. [PTF](https://www.etf.com/PTF#overview) \-  Around 24k shares daily  


Advice online generally says to avoid stocks/ETFs that trade at such low volumes. Is that true? Will I find it hard to sell these ETFs when I want to exit? Or will it not matter given how low my quantity is, compared to the daily volume?

In general, what's a "good" daily trading volume for a stock & ETF?

Blackberry is like that glorious team that won everything in the past and then got beaten so bad that it disappeared into the oblivion.. They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. 

Recently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. 
 
First Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.
 
 
Now who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? 
 
So this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.
 
Here is how it happened. 
 
Most car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It’s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can’t process much.  
 
QNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It’s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It’s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.
This is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. 

Why didn’t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?

Because they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It’s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It’s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn’t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.
 
They now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. 

Neymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. 

Even when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. 
 
Amazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It’s publicity.. A charity game. 



1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)

2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.

3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.

4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)

5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android. (Fact)

I think its fair to say that Blackberry is going to be a $ 100 Bn company.. it’s imminent.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pump of GME &#x200B;

Posted this on WSB but was banned, not surprised tho, all the good mods left.

Can we talk about GME?

I am not going to go into detail about whether I think the growth of the stock is justified. I could care less, I am not long or short on them. But what worries me is the stock manipulation on reddit, especially WSB. Rule 3 on the sub states no market manipulation. I have seen at least 10 posts today with titles along the lines DONT SELL, etc. Any good discussion is gone, when you bring up any decent point they call you a gay bear downvoted into oblivion.

I have been on WSB for the past 3 years, and it was never this bad. You used to see discussion there about different industries, rarely people trying to pump any stocks, and a lot of useful information on option strategies. Go on there now and tell me it does not look like a discord server with a bunch of teenagers.

The main problem with WSB now and why I think they will get closed down is due to the effect they have on the small-cap stocks. Take GME for example, if we consider that only 10% of WSB is in GME, and the average size of the position is 2 grand, they now collectively own around 10% of the company. Again, these estimates are extremely conservative. I can easily see them owning at least 30%. Here is what happens, a bunch of users find a stock like GME - post about it - meme about it - people on WSB buy the stock - price goes up - even more people buy - now GME is 20x in less than a year.

The previous console cycle in 2014 bumped their revenue by less than 10%. Back then they were positively cash flowing almost every year. Now, they have been losing money for the past 2 years, and this release is not going to do shit for them, considering Walmart is distributing a huge number of consoles and competing with them.

I am just worried about the trend where a company gets pumped and goes 5x every time WSB folks lay their eyes on a company.

1. More punished than peers due to dividend cut
2. Great balance sheet, already broken even with current WTI
3. US supply destruction, Mexico export restriction --> lots of north american demand
4. Negative sentiment around pipeline which should dissipate in time
5. Vaccine timeline indicates a reopening around September

2. fracking back online faster than expected if WTI goes above 60

Back then, Enphase energy was trading at $32 and many people naysayers flooded my inbox. People looked at the P/E ratio and I had responses saying that it wouldn't hold. Well, look at where we are now; ENPH became an industry leader in microinverters for solar panel systems and is now trading at a 566% gain from when I posted that. Hell; their ERs were negative at that point, but were increasingly getting closer to making positive revenue. Though I believe that there is still a long runway for ENPH and I do still have a position within it, I do believe that there is a potentially better investment moving forward.

As we all know, the Biden administration will push and promote renewables and renewable infrastructure within the next 4 years.

" He will launch **a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future**. "

[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)

Though most of the market is now aware of solar companies and wind energy companies, there is a huge gap in focus of infrastructure.

The next 4 years we will see a huge push and incentives for companies taking out age old infrastructure and replacing them with modern, ecofriendly, and more efficient systems to meet the rising demands of power.

**How do you get large renewable energy wind/solar, which is concentrated in the suburbs and farmlands of America, into the cities?** You do it with new power lines, and ideally more efficient ones.

That's where American Superconductor AMSC comes in.

This company specializes in MEGA-Watt scale power solutions that improve the performance of power grids., and electric utilities. This is ideal for moving new renewable energy from distant farmlands into large cities and meet the increasing demand for electricity.

As we know, there is increasing demand for Electric vehicles thanks to companies like Tesla as well as ramping up production of EVs from other car manufacturers. There will also be new wind as well as solar farms propping up in the very near future to meet the goals of switching to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels.  In the near future, we're going to see a lot more charging stations, as well as more demand in infrastructure to deliver renewables energy into cities.

Their main product,  a high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire that will take up less space and transmit up to **10 times more power**, **allowing bulk transfer of transmission-level power at distribution voltages.**

We're going to need new infrastructure to scale up the demand for renewable energy. AMSC will be one of those companies that will rise in the coming months and years.

Giving the ridiculous multiples we have seen for SAS IPO's (AirBnb, Snowflake, C3) recently, it's safe to assume that even Qualtrics might get listed over its IPO price point.

Since SAP will still hold over 80% of its stocks, will there be an increase in SAP stock price on the day of Qualtrics IPO? Technically it should since SAP's value will increase in proportion to the market value of Qualtrics.

If this is the case I was wondering if this only applies to profits. Let's say I invest £10000 and double my money to £20000. If I withdraw that whole 20k would I not pay any tax as I have only 10k profit? But if I tripled my money and withdraw 30k I would have to 870 in tax as I made 20k profit.

My question mainly pertains to how people think about total % gain. Generally, my brain thinks putting say $500 into an .80 cent stock that eventually blows up 300% is way better than putting that same $500 into say one Netflix stock that goes up 20% over that same timeframe.

Specifically TQQQ just did a 2:1 stock split. My total balance in my etrade account is correct, but when I look at individual lots, there are all messed up.

For example, I purchased shares in Jan. 2020 at $90. That position has gone up 100% in a year, however, now that the stock has split, its saying that I'm only up 8%. Basically the current post split price is reflecting in my account correctly, but the purchase price has remained unchanged rather than showing the new price based on the split.

Microsoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be.

Cel-Sci (CVM) is a biotech company with a focus on the Multikine drug, cytokines/chemokines, that is used for pre-surgery/chemo on head & neck cancer. The clinical trials was event driven meaning they needed 298 deaths, as prefaced by the FDA, to have a conclusive data set to determine whether the drug works or not. The trial went on for nine years since 2011 and finally reached its 298th event in April of 2020. Phase 2 had great results showing 33% improvement in overall survivability, and in some cases reduction in the tumor! Safe to say I am pretty stoked about Phase 3 results. Since the last event CVM has been compiling and verifying data, and they recently announced Data Lock in December. This means that they verified and "locked" the data, and it is ready for the final step -- Data Analysis. This final step typically takes 2-3 months before the data is released. I have a really good feeling about this! There has not been a development in Head&Neck cancer in 50 years. If the data shows improvement of 10% over SOC (standard of care), then the stock will absolutely moon! Think about it, if proven successful this drug could be the NEW standard of care. CVM is currently valued at 570M and with a buy-out it could be easily worth 3-5 billion. That is 500-900% we're talking here! However, if the drug is a bust, then you should expect to see this stock tank to $1. There is a huge risk to this play, but the potential payout is just too good to ignore. I am willing to lose $10,000 with the potential to gain $100,000! Below is a photo of the CEO, Geert Kersten, who has been relentlessly calling out lying shorts on Twitter.

Okay so everyone everyone probably remembers panasonic as a large brand that made things like TVs, fridges and other electronics, but they have fallen out of popularity.

Turns out the company has restructured itself and is now one of the largest suppliers of lithium ion batteries in the world. It is currently the main supplier of tesla and Toyota (who's first fully electric car was recently announced) . They also supply Honda on a smaller scale.

NIO’s 2nd generation battery swapping station:
- holds 13 batteries
- takes up four parking spaces 
- can swap 312x per day (5 mins/swap)

Tesla’s supercharger:
- takes up one parking space
- takes 75 mins to 100% recharge (max: 19.2x/day)

Assuming full capacity, in order for Tesla to fully recharge 312 batteries/day, Tesla would need 16.25 superchargers (16.25 parking spaces). 

Efficiency: NIO wins (5 mins vs 75 mins)

Space: NIO wins (4 parking spaces vs 16.25 parking spaces). This is especially important in crowded cities like Shanghai, NYC where land is expensive.  

I don’t have the cost of NIO stations and Tesla superchargers so I can’t do a cost analysis.  I know the cost of 2nd generation stations is 1/2 the cost of first generation so cost is going down.  

NIO is planning to double its swapping stations to 500 by the end of 2021.  Therefore, NIO would need 500 x 13 batteries = 6,500 batteries.  Assuming each battery cost $10,000...the total cost is $65m.  

Unknown:  Can Tesla reduce recharging time? It is possible but due to safety and degradation issues, recharging time has not changed much over the years.

I used 100% recharge for comparison purpose.  It takes a Tesla supercharger 40 minutes to recharge 80% of the original 85kWh battery.  Even if I were to compare 80% of Tesla  (supercharger) to 100% of NIO (battery swapping station), Tesla would still lose by a mile.

Edit: NIO also has superchargers like Tesla.  Battery swapping stations offer drivers an additional charging option._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ KLR - Cheap alternative to TWLO/Bandwidth (CPaaS) KLR (Kaleyra) is a much smaller competitor of TWLO/Bandwidth offering customer engagement suites via instant messages, WhatsApp, email and voice call. It was founded by ex-Oracle employee in 1998 in Italy and recently have grown its presence in US and India via strategic acquisitions. 

KLR was taken public via reverse merger by GigCapital in 2019. However, the stock was punished during covid (and due to lack of fanfares) and it has only got back to pre covid level recently. On the surface, the stock might look expensive now considering +300% move from the bottom in Mar 2020. 

However, the stock remains comparatively cheap especially compared to its competitors. 

KLR is currently trading at 2.5x revenue while Bandwidth is trading at 15x revenue and Twilio at over 30x revenue. KLR definitely lacks the Silicon Valley connection and fanfare, hence might not fully enjoy the rich valuation of Twilio. 

However here are some facts to consider why KLR is an attractive alternative:

- It’s revenue has been growing at 30% CAGR since 2015 from $60m to $160m in 2020

- It’s EBITDA margin is expected to expand as the company has high operating leverage

- It enjoys blue chip companies as their clients with some growing rapidly along with the company (Flipkart, Byju, Uber)

- It’s retention rate among clients is very sticky 

- It just started growing in US (US revenue was 6% in 2019, 20% in 2020)

- Even Twilio is a client of KLR in connectivity

Elastic was originally fully open source but changed the terms of their licensing to stop companies like Amazon from freely using their code to provide the same paid service that Elastic provides.

In 2019, AWS created a fully open source version of elasticsearch but it wasn't a fork (meaning that code contributions went to both the AWS version and the Elastic version of the source code) When that happened, the stock dropped 20%.

Will Disney+ make this company a must have? What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney’s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what’s the upside for the stock! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

Let’s start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.

Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks & experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks & streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.

So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.

Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.

They announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney & Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).

The company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).

Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android & Apple devices, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google’s devices.

The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven’t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN+.

Hulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads & live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.

They also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.

But guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.

Despite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarterly & yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment & the Park, Experiences & Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.

Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top & bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media & Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.

I also used the Depreciation & Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.

So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For Disney’s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks & Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 & 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let’s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

They‘re a Battery Developing- and Producing Company with a ready factory and ties to the german automobile lobby ([production of batteries in saxony, germany](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=129)) and their development (especially with Solid State Batteries) has close ties to some of the best research centres. It‘s supported by [the federal swiss laboratories for materials science](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=133) and the Bern university of applied sciences, which the former is in the top 10 of all global science laboratories if I‘m correct. 

Goals

Their goal is to produce next-gen batteries that will power a whole lot of things: phones, cars, even [ships.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=134) They want to be competitive in the market of tomorrow and produce 3-d printed Solid State Batteries for practically anything as long as it‘s possible.

They also have mines for different resources in norway, peru, chile, china mongolia and mlre all around the world where they try to farm their own material.

Current & Price Target

As of writing, their Price is 6$ per share, and because of the rapid development and the lobby they‘re in they received a 12$ + price target EOY on 18th january, which [could even go higher IMO as they expand rapidly.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=136)

News

They have a great website with [all the important news on here.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/)

If they expand and keep up the development and connections to the swiss federal institutes of material science etc. I really believe this will be a long term runner.

Verdict

In it‘s current state, there‘s not much that can go wrong, and because of the lobby they‘re in there‘s HUGE expansion potential. 

I believe the stock price could be 20x or more in 2-3 years. 

My position (I‘m poor): 120$ @ 5.4Fr, approximately 20 Shares

Ticker: BLS (Six switzerland)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | Intel [INTC], Tesla [TSLA] & Other Stock Market News [01-22] **Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office. Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

**\~Long post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to drop, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, dropping over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher & higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction & lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I am new to stock and I was wondering if anyone could correct me. 

If I buy $10,000 of stock on 01/22/2021 and the stock goes up to $20,000 and I sell $10,000 worth of stock on 09/22/2021, will I owe any tax during 2021? My assumption is no. 

If I sell other $10,000 (20,000-10,000) on 01/23/2022, I will have tax due - long term capital gain of $10,000.

Another question is, what if I only sell $5,000 worth of stock out of $20,000 on 09/22/2021, will I report owe any tax for 2021? No, I assume. I would still have $15,000 worth of stock.

A lot of people here have said that ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography. And companies like TSM and Intel have to order from ASML. They make it like ASML is a must if you want to play semis/chip stocks.

But I read that Lam Research is doing EUV lithography as well and have partnered with ASML to develop products.

LRXC seems to have better value and a slightly better dividend. ASML already has a huge market cap.

Does ASML really have a monopoly? Do you see them out growing LAM Research?

It seems like ASML and LRXC move almost exactly the same together. I'm just not sure if I am missing something that will have ASML outperform LRXC from now on. Because it seems like they both can offer the same stuff and have good management and fundamentals.

I usually click right on the „max“ scale to see how the stock has been doing since it started and a lot of big companies take Apple for example, looks like they’re peaking or let’s say going up not steady but quickly over the last 5 -7 years.


How are people so sure that all these companies are a good investment because to me, as a complete noob it looks like they’d flat out at some point, especially bigger companies and especially Apple. If you think in a bigger scheme: Apple hasn’t been delivering their iPhone for not so long and if you look into the next 25/30 years I think it’s very likely that in that timespan, Apple will have way more competitors and won’t be peaking anymore?

How bad/crazy is my strategy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Complete PLTR DD ahead of Demo Day (Valuation Included) # Company Overview

Palantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.

Later they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.

Palantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.

Palantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.

# Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Institutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.

When it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.

A central operating system for data

Palantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.

Augmenting existing data systems, not displacing

At a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.

Making data actionable

Gotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.

Their ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.

Understand the history of data and decisions

Palantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.

Enable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances

The versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.

Users can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.

Enforce rigorous and reliable data protection

Palantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.

AI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions

Their software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.

The AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.

**Revenue Streams**

Palantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.

Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.

It is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.

Gotham

Its main tools include:

Graph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Ava – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.

Mobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.

Foundry

Monocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.

Contour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

Fusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.

Reports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.

I strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.

Palantir’s Software Example Use Cases

* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.
* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.
* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.
* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.
* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.

As of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.

Currently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.

According to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Embrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted

It has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.

We have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.

Buy or Build

Institutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.

Additionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.

Palantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.

Crisis & Instability

A [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

Palantir’s main competitors include:

Internal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.

And two software companies with very similar business models:

[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.

[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.

**Competitive Strategy**

Customer acquisition

Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.

Additionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.

Software engineers on the front line

In order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.

Leverage experience in both private and public sector

To the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.

Palantir’s strategic relationships last for years

By the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.

Palantir has chosen sides

Their software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.

**Growth Strategy**

Become the industry default

Palantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.

This model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.

Continue to grow their direct sales force

Palantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

Increase their reach with existing customers

To drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:

* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers
* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities
* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases

For Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.

Become the default operating system for the U.S. government

Palantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.

Palantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.

New methods of customer acquisition and partnership

As Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.

For example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.

**Moats**

R&D expenditure

Since 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.

Network effects

Every data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.

At a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.

Additionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.

In addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.

Regulation

Section 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.

In 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Privacy and civil liberties

Palantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.

Customer concentration

For the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.

**Income Statement**

[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)

Palantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.

For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:

* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.
* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).
* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Palantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.

# Investment Decision

**Valuation Results**

[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)

The result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**

Mayor assumptions of the valuation model include:

* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.
* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.
* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.
* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%

Follow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.

**Investment Decision**

I believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:

* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.
* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.
* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I be hedging to buy the next big dip? **TL;DR at bottom**

Background:
28, good job, reliable income
I consider myself a responsible, almost boomer-level investor. I max out every tax advantaged account I’m able to contribute to (401k, Roth IRA, HSA) and don’t touch those investments at all. I also have a conservatively invested emergency fund set aside. 

Upon realizing I maxed all my qualified contributions in November I opened up a TD brokerage account and have been obsessively investing there since then. All my positions there are tech and a few meme stocks (as of today my largest position is $BB). I don’t fuck with options and I have yet to sell any of my positions. Being this concentrated in overvalued tech stocks is the closest I’ll come to a true YOLO. As of this writing my balance there is close to 60k. 

I’m sure I’m not alone here,but I’m growing increasingly concerned about a correction and am wondering how to best prepare for it. 

I’m already bummed that I missed the COVID dip last year and want to buy a correction dip if/when it comes. I don’t love the idea of letting $20k sit in a cash account making no interest just in case the dip happens, so I’m considering putting like $5k into a bear ETF (eying $TZA) with the expectation that it will rocket during a correction, at which point I can sell and use the proceeds to buy the stocks I want during the firesale. 

I haven’t seen anything like this discussed here at all. Why is this a stupid idea? What am I missing?

Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR**: For use in buying the next big dip, does it make sense to hold a bear ETF as opposed to sitting on cash?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Screener software that searches for stocks outside of standard deviation channel.

  [https://tos.mx/XoBwHIr](https://tos.mx/XoBwHIr)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone rip my stock trading plan apart? I have been trading for about 9 months now and properly swing traded with a plan for about half a year now.

The plan was created based on my own research with backtesting. I did random backtest at random periods using Chartmill (Stock scanner) over the past decade and the results were pretty good, yielded me 7/10 winning trades at 1R.

Understood that backtesting and real trades can be different but my results in real life have not been so great. The plan so far is yielding me negative return (\~4/10 winning trades at 1R so far with about \~150 trades completed).

I am wondering if I am just going through a period of drawdown or there's some problem with my trading plan.

**Can you rip my trading plan apart so I know how to improve it?**

**The overview of my plan is as below:**

**Risk per Trade:**

* 1% of my total available capital at all time

**Risk at any moment:**

* Maximum 10% expose at any given time (news from Trump can kill my portfolio any day (e.g. stimulus delay)

**Execution Plan**

This strategy is based on the fundamental idea that stocks tend to snap back and make pauses during a strong uptrend. This strategy tries to capture **short-term momentum** in an **uptrend** on the **daily** timeframe in a **bull market** by entering during the **consolidating phase**.

**General Rules:**

* US Stocks market
* Daily Timeframe Only
* Any **Pullback** or **Continuation** patterns. This includes:
   * Rectangle or Consolidation
   * Flags or Pennant
   * Triangles (Ascending, Descending, Symmetrical)
   * We are simply taking advantages of a pause in an uptrend
* Trade only when SP500 is **above 20 EMA** during normal market condition on the **daily timeframe**. This means:
   * No trades after strong momentum against in the SP500 or Nasdaq - because this could be a sign for reversal. Stay away from the market (remove all stop orders and tighten stop loss) if SP500 dropped more than 1%
   * No trades when SP500 or Nasdaq are in sideway conditions e.g. cutting through the 20EMA
   * We trade only uptrend because of the baseline drift. Price tends to move up which gives us a better edge staying on the long side.

**Indictors:**

* EMAs (20, 50, 200) - for detecting trend and pullbacks
* Volume - for breakout confirmation
* ATR Bands (20, 1.5) - for initial stop loss
* Chandelier Stop (22, 20, 2) - for trailing stop loss
* Keltner Channel (20, 2.5) - for identifying strong upthrusts and pullbacks
* SP500 - for detecting abnormal market behaviours

**Trading Methodology:**

* Trade with an uptrend (price has to be above 200 EMA)
* The entry has to be around an area of value like:
   * Trendline
   * Support or Resistance
   * Moving Average (20 EMA)
   * Channel
* Entry trigger, when price breaks above the flag (stop order)
* Stop-loss - 1.5 ATR below the low of the structure
* Profit target - 1R (1:1 risk to reward), we use our risk level to find profit target
* Trade management - we will not touch it after the trade is entered. We don't enter more trades when the overall market is making a pullback
* Other rules: allow one re-entry if we get stopped out

Q4 2017 because iPhone X was released which was different than the previous iPhone 7 and 7 plus.

Q4 2018 because iPhone XS was almost same as iPhone X.

Q4 2019 again iPhone 11 Pro series which is again similar to X series but the cameras were different.

I’m expecting Q4 2020 to play out in a similar fashion as Q4 2018 as iPhone 12 series is very similar to iPhone 11 series.
