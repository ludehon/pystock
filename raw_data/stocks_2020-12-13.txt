 Warrants and how they work? Hello everybody I’ve only been trading/investing for maybe a year now. Always stuck to buy and selling stock, never really dabbled in calls or puts. I’ve been looking at a lot of SPACs lately and doing DD into them to see which I would be interested in. When I started doing that I noticed that warrants were a thing. I had never heard of this and did research into what a warrant is, and now I have questions.

Lets say for example. that I purchase 1 warrant of THCB, at 2.10. That gives me the opportunity to purchase 1 share of THCB at the strike price. My first question is how do I know what the strike price is? Is it the price of the stock at the time i purchase the warrant? When I look at my Charles Schwab mobile app to purchase warrants right now, I don’t see any mention of strike price so I’m lost there.

Now for example I do purchase 1 warrant at 2.10 and the strike price is 12. Let’s say then that the stock jumps to 17 and I decide to exercise my warrant ( from my understanding this then means purchasing the share at the price of 12 dollars.) I can then go ahead and immediately sell my share for market price which is 17 bucks. So that means I spent 14.10 and made a profit of 2.90 (2.10 for the warrant + 12 to purchase the share) is this math correct? 

If this is the case I only make a profit of 2.90 but if I had purchased the stock at 12 I would have made 5 dollars of profit. So why do so many people purchase warrants more than stock? Seems to decrease your profit %, which is where I am lost. 

Last question is what if I don’t have the money to exercise the warrant? I spent 2.10 on the warrant at the strike price of 12. So let’s say I have 0 dollars to my name, I can’t exercise my warrant because I don’t have any money correct? Or is there a way to exercise and sell immediatly and only pocket the difference between current price (17) - strike price (12) while not having to buy it first to then sell?

Thoughts on these stocks potentially rising, or have they already in a "buy the rumor, sell the news" situation?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/14/2020 My Plays For 12/14/2020:

I use the 180D/4H chart exclusively. 
10, 50, 200 EMA Lines, RSI, Stochastic, and MACD are the indicators I use. 

Check my profile for photos. 

$AEP - Developed a double bottom basically, and now retesting this very strong support. The POC volume area is above pulling it up, and has plenty of room to run. I love the price action set up. RSI is oversold.

$AMRX - Massive trendline it is living at again, at a support, with the volume node pulling it u. RSI and Stochastic oversold, and this support is historically very strong.

$CAH - 70% Volume area support holding, and above the 200EMA. Stochastic and RSI oversold - so it has room to run up here. But that is it, it certainly has some room to drop.

$CLNE - Very large scale triangle forming, and it is holding at this support inside of the triangle. If it does take off, it is going to be crazy strong. It is also holding this 50EMA which is awesome to see.

$DKS - Old resistance being tested as a support again here. Stochastic is low and RSI is oversold. MACD cannot get much lower. There is also a very pretty uptrend it seems to be respecting as well.

$EPRT - Once again; old resistance being tested as a support now. 50EMA is helping to hold it up, and it is obviously up trending. If it lives here go long. Stochastic and RSI are oversold.

$EQT - Simply put - simple channel play up; support, and being bounced near the POC volume node at this moment. Looking great to go long.

$FR - This up-trending line has been very strong for months and here we are again. If it breaks the 200ENa again it'll be great. RSI and Stochastic are oversold as well.

$HLT - Simple channel play. At support inside this baby channel forming, if it holds up here an easy 6%.

$KNL - Testing resistance as support again, 50EMA support, and very close to an uptrend line? Love this set up with Stochastic being so low!

$LUV - New resistance being tested, and formed a double bottom. This has room to drop still, where it may have a great bounce at the 200EMA. But it is a great channel.

$MLCO - Formed a new channel, and it has some room to drop. Let it hit $18 and play off of it there, but Stochastic is very low which I love.

$PEG - Beautiful uptrend channel play, at a support, with RSI under 30!? Love it, this will be a nice simple play here.

$SKX - Steep trend up, in channel that is re-testing a resistance as a support here. Stoch and RSI look good, if it lives here it should be a screamer!

$SPT - Up trending channel again, at a support, that is also above the 200EMA? Beautiful! Bullish Divergence and Stochastic with RSI oversold, love it!

$TJX - Channel up, with a support AND 50EMA beneath it, simple enough - and ride it while you can!

$UMPQ - Exact same play as $TJX ^.

$VMC - Beautiful channel up - which is gorgeous. 
Support and 200EMA beneath it, I think this is a gorgeous set up. RSI and Stochastic also oversold - love it even more.

$WCN - Same exact set up as $WCN ^.

$WDAY - Same exact play as $WCN as well ^._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could Palantir (PLTR) Be in a Dying Industry? Palantir is know for its contract with the military and oil drilling companies.

For instance, in the form of consulting. In corporate culture diversity (in hiring, but also in the form of non-discriminatory workplace culture) it seems to have become a somewhat serious issue in US in the last decade, at least for bigger companies. So shouldn't diversity consulting (i.e. certificates, cultural sensitivity & bias awareness trainings, coaching to avoid problematic behavior on social media, etc.) be a growing market, even if only to show you've done your part as a company?

With Google, I only found a handful of US companies for diversity consulting, but all of them small and private, which seems curious to me since even my small European home country (where cultural diversity is much less of an issue compared to the US) has a handful of consulting firms dedicated to diversity these days.

I believe that the fact that there is no additional infrastructure or construction needed makes this a great option for many places that want to add EV charges. What's better is that they are not competing with Companies like ChargePoint or Blink Charging because Beam does not supply the chargers, this means blink, ChargePoint and whatever other charging companies come along can buy or rent the EV ARC and add it to their charging network. The company's financials seem solid and since Biden will be in soon and EVs are exploding in popularity I think the growth will be incredible. If you missed the hype and pops of EV charging stocks like SBE and BLNK I think this is the one to get in on.

It is a very long post but read until the end of the post as I give my price target for TESLA long-term and also what I think will happen in the next couple of weeks**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hey everyone and Welcome! This is a very long post just so you know but let’s go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.

So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.

The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the world’s regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.

Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.

Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.

Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.

Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.

My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more & more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.

The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Tesla’s.

I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.

You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.

This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses.

So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musk’s target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.

This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.

And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.

I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.

So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.

And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.

That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$

Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.

Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.

As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.

The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.

Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.

The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.

So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.

Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.

Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla don’t think at the old & traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they can’t get enough of this stock at the moment.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news & sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500.

The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range.

I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.

Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.

Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesn’t go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.

The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day.

So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

So when it comes to commodity type stock, and or mining companies, what usually happens to a stock when they sell a whole mine/piece of the pie? It states in the article that FCX was asking 50million for this mine. I'm new to the mining sector but do see copper continuing to rise with the growing trend and demand for EVs. Hence why I'm asking about FCX. 

What would this 50million be used for and what kind of impact would it have on the stock itself?

“Inside every smartphone and tablet lies a dense brick with a dark and complex history: its battery. The lithium that ferries charge back and forth likely started out in South American salt flats, where months of evaporation consumes millions of tons of water in some of the world’s driest regions. The cobalt that buffers the material against the ravages of daily recharging probably came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where children have allegedly been maimed and killed extracting it from the ground. To gather the assorted atoms and fashion them into a working battery may have required thousands of people from perhaps a dozen countries. Then, after a few years of use, spent devices often end up in landfills and incinerators. 

As lithium-ion batteries stand poised to jump from handheld devices into cars, trucks, and homes, entrepreneurs and academics are racing to find a way to reuse the hard-won materials. Investors are betting millions that a Nevada company, Redwood Materials, can mine electronic waste for metals. A competitor, Li-Cycle, aims to crack the logistical puzzle of transporting batteries.

The fossil fuels and energy industry took a huge hit due to covid because of the impact it’s had on transportation.  Natural gas however should fair differently when compared to oil.

But hopefully this post at least gives you an idea, and you can do your own research as well (as you always should!)

For novice investors: you should find an ETF that correspond to the industries mentioned below, instead of individual stocks. 

You may have already missed the initial jump by now, some of my stocks (Air Canada, Beoing) have already gone up 20-30% since I bought in Oct/Nov. These all have almost identical YTD growth curves from 2020, so you can spot them very easily. 

**Airlines/plane makers**: JETS (etf) is in my opinion a very safe bet, but if you want a bit of risk but potentially higher returns, Raytheon, Air canada, united airlines, boeing, Spirit aerosystems, ARR Corp. 

**Retail/investment banking**: mortgage, deferrals, low interest rates, etc. if you have a relatively long time horizon, I except this sector to rebound in the next 1-2 years. 

ETF: KRE, IAT, KBE, ZWB, ZEB, there's other ones, pick one that suits you best. 

Most Canadian retail banks have recovered to pre-COVID levels except Bank of Nova Scotia. 

American retail banks: Bank of America, etc.
American investment banks: JP morgan, wells fargo, etc. I'm sure you can find plenty of stocks in this sector. 

**Oil/gas**: long term wise they are on their way out, but short-medium term they stand to gain a lot as things slowly improve.

Oil/gas ETFs: XLE (or whichever other ones you like).

Oil/gas stocks: suncor, enbridge, Exxon mobile, BP, chevron. 

**Real estate/Property management**: 

ETFs: VNQ, XLRE, XRE, 

Stocks: Brookfield Property (BPY.UN), Riocan, (not familiar with US ones)

**Entertainment**: PEJ (etf) to be safe. 

entertainment stocks: six flags, dave and busters, great canadian gaming corp, carribean cruiselines, norweigian cruiselines, IMAX, cedar fair.

Hello guys, if you Look at Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) they had a flight test yesterday that was ‘aborted’ because the computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection. As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. After this they landed safely in Spaceport America. According to their Twitter statement they are fixing and analysing what went wrong and they are preparing for the second test flight which will be ‘soon’.

After these news I believe the stock will drop around 25% because paper hands must have gotten scared or lost faith in this company, therefore, this is the best time to buy calls or shares and keep these for the long term.

Remember that Virgin Galactic is one of the few companies that could have a massive growth potential in the future. They will be the first company to enter and dominate the ‘Space Tourism’ market with few competition. 

If the next test flight goes well and they reach space the share price is going to Mars, they have contracts with nasa and they are working in other experiments like the jet that would take you from London to New York in two hours. 📈✅

For those who don’t know Virgin Galactic is a company that wants to bring its customers to space and make it possible for regular people be able to see our home planet from a new perspective. The price of each ticket costs over $250,000 and over 600 people have already booked their place including famous celebrities like Leonardo Dicaprio and Justin Bieber.

As Warren Buffet says:’ Buy the f*cking dip’

Recommended action: Long term calls or shares are the way to go. Remember to do your own DD before options or shares.

TLDR: Full DCF (this sub doesn't allow images): [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot\_a\_great\_company\_undervalued\_by\_43/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot_a_great_company_undervalued_by_43/)

Current price: $74.32Estimated price: $128.98Margin of safety: 43%**Background**

iRobot is a US-based consumer robot company. It designs and builds robots that assist consumers with the solutions for the activities to be carried both inside and outside of the home.

It derives the nearly all of it's revenue from it's in house cleaning robots. iRobot price range for it's robots are between $250 to $1000+. The cheapest robots give a simplistic cleaning such as just bouncing around the room multiple times to clean whereas the most expensive robots have AI to detect and smart map your room/house and efficiently clean.

The big selling points of this top tier robot range is the auto emptying bin functionality that has made these robots almost completely autonomous without much human interaction needed. This high tier product range is where iRobot really shines compared to it's competitors.

**Competitors**

iRobot's biggest risk in my opinion is it's competitors.

There are already quite a few such as Shark, Ecovacs, Roborock, Neato, iLife, and eufy. As autonomous vacuum cleaners become more popular (and they will) we can expect more competitors to enter this space as well potentially causing margins to be pushed down. Dyson, Bissell, Hoover, Samsung, LG and Panasonic are the traditional heavyweights and are also entering this space. Dyson especially has a history of innovation and could be a future threat.

While iRobot has lost 12% market share since 2016 the overall market is significantly bigger, especially for the upper end product mix.

This is great news for iRobot as their products have the most added value in the upper range of this mix with features such as:- Auto emptying into bins- Smart AI pathfinding- Efficient charging of it's robots- Deep clean capability

The upper end of it's products have great reviews online.

**Numbers**Opearing margin: 11%No debt.PEG Ratio: 0.78.ROIC vs WACC 22% to 10.11%

iRobot has some really great numbers relative to it's peers. It's operating margins especially are indictive of a big MOAT and consumer loyalty.

**DCF**

I used Aswath Damoradan's spreadsheet for this. Here are the inputs:

**18% CAGR** was chosen for years 2-5. Considering the rapidly expanding autonomous vacuum market and now COVID-19 has accelerated this very rapidly due to more people spending time at home therefore they are spending more on household items.

The recent revenue growths of 40% in the last quarter are due to the full lockdowns people have had. I expect this to drop in the following years to 18% on average.

**10% EBIT Margin** was chosen for year 10. COVID-19 has had a big impact so far this quarter on margins due to the huge demand. This will level off though.

iRobot has a loyal product base and as they have shifted more towards the high end products I expect them to acheive margins of around 10% in year 10.

**3 years** was chosen for the margins to converge. This is because the short term spike from covid should level off.

**2.5 sales to cap ratio** was chosen. COVID-19 has stalled the companies plans to transition away from China to other parts of Asia, including Malaysia to 2021. This transitioning is happening due to the tarrifs between China & the U.S. This should cause a short term dip in sales to capital ratio in 2021 due to having to reinvest heavily to move it's operations out of China.

Current price: $74.32

Estimated price: $128.98

I am interested in long-term investing so anything related to this style of investing would be helpful. 

Thank you in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Starting out in stock trading I'm very new to this sub and I came here because I want to start trading stocks with $200 for a start. I've gone through various posts on this sub to get a grip on how to go about it, and so far what I've been able to deduce is that I should start out with index funds just to get my feet wet.

Just curious. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the pandemic and its aftereffects on the economy were far worse than the financial crisis back in 08. However, the market managed to recover pretty quickly but in 08, it took quite a  long time to recover. Why is that?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upwork (UPWK) is a great stock if you're in for the long term For those that don't know, UPWK is a platform for freelancers to find work.

Remember when Pewdiepie paid some random guy in Africa $5 to say some crap on a piece of paper back in 2012 for memes? Yeah, who thought their platform would be used by today **millions** of people and have its stock go from **$30** to **$200** within a year of IPO (Fiverr); just a fun fact but the name Fiverr originated from the cost of its original services: $5.

The crucial difference with Upwork though is its ***professionalism and a stable income*** when it comes to freelancing. I feel like we're already living in an era with all these self-built entrepreneurs and people who keep pushing the idea that you don't need to live your life doing a  9-5 job stuck behind a desk; another thing the pandemic has proven was how the majority of jobs can be done remotely with no problem, so commuting is both a waste of time and money.

If you were to simply google "Best freelancing websites" in articles from 2015, 2016, up even to now in 2020, you'll see Upwork listed on **every single list**. It is also available in 180 countries, which means it's accessible to almost anywhere across the world. In fact, Forbes predicts [that if freelancing continues to grow at its current rate, the majority of U.S. workers will be freelancing by 2027](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2017/10/17/are-we-ready-for-a-workforce-that-is-50-freelance/?sh=78c358653f82), and just a reminder, that this is just within the U.S. Now imagine worldwide.

[Here's a chart of the growth for visuals](https://imgur.com/a/ZLtt40e)

This is a company which I can foresee is going to dominate in a space of their own. Let me elaborate by giving a DD to first bring the uninitiated up to speed.

Merger Company: **Electric Last Mile Solutions (ELMS)**

As its name implies, ELMS primarily operates in the last mile delivery market from the transportation hub to the final destination - either to the customer's doorstep or retailers. With the continued rise in the e-commerce space, the market for last mile delivery vehicles would only become more important. This is soon becoming a $1 trillion market due to the exploding e-commerce scene in US. You may think "meh, it's already a saturated market flooding with competitors in the EV space, what's so different about this?"

Familiar with Blue Ocean Strategy & First-Mover advantage? If not, here is a live example with what ELMS is doing:  
Think of the EV space as a red ocean with rivalling competitors like Workhorse, Hyliion, Lightning eMotor, Tesla, Arrival and many others. However, if you break them down to different class categories, most vehicles are in the class 3 to class 8 categories (more heavy duty vehicles). Now, think of a blue ocean with little or no competition - **Class 1 EV Vehicles.** And this is exactly what ELMS is focusing on, where they are the ***first*** to bring in their Urban Delivery EV Vehicles in the Class 1/2 segment in the US. They also have the Urban Utility which operates in the Class 3 segment (Medium-duty). Therefore, ELMS' strategy to target the Class 1 to 3 category in the commercial delivery vehicle market will represent over 80% of the last mile market.

Three biggest competitive advantages they have going for them right now:

1. **U.S plant with existing operations ->** ELMS will be acquiring the former Hummer plant in Indiana which is currently owned by Sokon, a Chinese publicly-listed company with a proven track record of more than 30k EV vans already sold and driven **ON THE ROAD** since 2017. Now, I understand your concerns with this as Chinese companies aren't receiving a good rep recently especially with the current regulatory & delisting woes.

However, let me ease your concerns with the following points:

* ELMS will be an ***independent*** US company where vehicles are produced right here in US. Sokon will only provide the know-hows, supplying certain parts, and field data which is critical for scaling operations. Majority of EV systems and components are sourced in US, and compliant with US regulations This means that ELMS will NOT be affected by any of the above issues since it is an independent entity.
* To be frank, it's a smart strategic move by ELMS to acquire the existing operations of Sokon. Just imagine the sky-rocketing costs involved in engineering/developing/R&D from scratch. Rather than incurring such costs, why not based it on an established EV company in Asia with a proven track record of already 30,000+ EVs on the road? This also helps to lower ELMS operating costs.

1. **Over 30,000 pre-orders with expected revenue of US$1B**  **->** from B2B customers like fleet managers , dealers and upfitters which the eventual end users are shipping and e-commerce companies such as Walmart, FedEX, Ikea & Best Buy. This will be delivered in 2021 Q3 which is ***WITHIN ONE YEAR***\*.\*
2. **Lowest total cost of ownership** **->** 35% reduction in TCO compared to current Class 1 Gas Vehicles. Having a low TCO is important to establish a foothold in the last mile delivery market. This market doesn't give a shit how aesthetic/futuristic looking it should be (e.g. Arrival) but price matters, because why? Fleet managers want to lower the cost of delivery for their end customers so they can be more competitive. To lower cost of delivery, you will have to lower the cost of operations which is only possible if the TCO is low for vehicles. Therefore, I believe that ELMS is able to drive greater value to their B2B clients, and this will significantly attract more businesses = more revenue.

Still not enough? Let us briefly talk about management, both ELMS & Forum Merger.

**ELMS** \- CEO & Founder, James Taylor. He was previously the CEO of Workhorse with over 35+ years of experience in this industry, where he served as President for Cadillac and CEO for Hummer. This dude is an experienced veteran in this industry.

**Forum Merger Corp** \- Management and track records are important. This company previously performed two successful mergers. The first one was ConvergeOne in 2018, which was acquired nine months after merger by CVC capital. The second one is the recent success in October this year, Tattooed Chef, a leading plant-based company. Peak price went up to $25 per share prior to merger.

ELMS's merger is slated to be completed the first quarter of 2021. I believe that with the current EV hype and strong tailwinds in the last mile delivery market, the current share price of $12.49 (or $12.89 AH) is a steal. Easily, this could hit the range of $14 - $15 within this week or next and $17-$18 at height prior before merger.

Non of these long term stuff cuz its way too low. Need to grow it. Two options.

1. Diversify and like put a limit to the amount I should spend on a stock. Like 100$ for each stock regardless of share price. And so I can own like 5 stocks at once.

2. Or Yolo a big chunk of my account into one stock I'm confident about (but no one knows ofc) and so gain alot more if it goes my way. But ofcourse I'll have to up my risk.

Keep in mind, ill have stop losses in both cases im not idiot, but with option 2, the risk does increase a bit cuz i wouldnt want the stop loss to be very tight._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If you are thinking, what could be a good capital to generate weekly profits to pay some of your daily expenses then, THIS READ IS FOR YOU! Let's begin with what, in my opinion, is the structure of trading. It is the **risk-reward ratio** in your trades and the **capital % loss** if the stop-loss triggers.

*Follow this realistic scenario.*

Out of all trading assets globally, you will pick **5-10** (mainly with low correlation among all assets). Now you have a pool of assets that you can trade in the 1H / 4H chart through the week. With 10 assets in your portfolio, you could scout enough to open 3-5 trades per week. Usually, realistic trades in the 1H chart execute in a 1-3 day period, while in the 4H chart, they execute in a 5-14 day period.

**Now, HOW MUCH CAPITAL TO START?** *(Let's develop a basic risk management strategy for our example.)*

Let's use round numbers; imagine we have $10,000. You could open positions with **3:1 risk-reward ratios** where we lose **1% at stop loss**. Since our risk-reward ratio is 3:1, then we would profit $300 at take-profit

Also, assuming that you are following your trading strategies by the books (like buying in a 20\_moving\_average during a trend), you have to be wrong 5 times **IN A ROW** to be down $500 / 5%.

Also, think about this, since all your trades have the same 3:1 risk-reward ratio, you could have 3 losses in a row and roughly recover your capital with 1 win.

My recommendation, focus on the candlesticks with real price action. Many traders I helped in the past spent too much time focusing on the wrong candles. Try to have a reason for every trade, and for a reason, I mean candlestick confirmation!

Probably you know the price is hovering at the resistance line, and you want to open a short entry but, try to wait at least for a bearish pin bar at the resistance line, or a fakeout reversal, or a bearish engulfing candle. If it doesn't happen, don't worry, you have 10 assets to keep scouting for that perfect entry. Just make sure that your assets don't correlate (at least most of them)

Start by backtesting trading strategy. There are plenty of free tools where you can backtest a trading strategy without putting your capital at risk.

What am I missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What am I not understanding about "beating the market" / stock gains? Most studies I've seen say that less than 8% or so of professionals manage to beat the market i.e. earn more returns than S&P or earn more than about 5-8% per year.

But as a really simple example, if you just bought AMZN every time it dips below $3100 and sold every time it's above $3200, you'd make a 3% profit or so, and you could do that pretty much every month to get around 40% per year.

There's obviously lots of stocks with that kind of average fluctuation that you could just keep trading, and if they're fairly safe stocks you can assume that you won't be down for longer than a couple months if it doesn't regularly spike back up which would still put you way above 5% per year. Granted there's always potential for losses that would set you back, but if you're diversifying, I still can't imagine only gaining 5-8% per year.

Is "beating the market" only talking about investing (i.e. buying and holding long term) rather than trading stocks (i.e. frequently buying, selling, rebuying at profit)? Or is there something I'm missing that explains why you can't do this with trading to make at least like 25% a year?

I've been trying to figure out a good goal to aim for, and 5-8% gains a year is just way too little since I plan on trading for a couple years while I build my portfolio up and then switching to long term investments. I don't want to aim for crazy 100% gains or anything, but I can't see at all why people talk like anything above 5-8%/yr is unrealistic.

Check_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Affirm joins Roblox in delaying its planned 2020 IPO after monster gains from Airbnb, Doordash Affirm's planned 2020 IPO has been put on hold until next year, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The point-of-sale lender's decision to postpone its IPO comes shortly after Roblox decided to postpone its planned 2020 IPO until next year to seek a higher price, given the strong investor demand for high-growth tech IPOs.

Affirm planned to begin pitching its shares to potential investors this coming week, and was on track to receive a market valuation of as much as $10 billion, according to The Journal.

Part of the reason Affirm delayed its offering was due to the high price spikes in recent offerings from Airbnb and DoorDash, as well as delays at the Securities Exchange Commission due to a surge in listing requests from private companies, the Journal reported.

Airbnb surged as much as 143% in its first day of trades on Thursday, while DoorDash closed higher by 86% in its first day of trading on Wednesday.

Now, Affirm's public debut won't come until January at the earliest, according to the report. 

Affirm and Roblox are attempting to strike a delicate balance of not leaving any money on the table by pricing their IPO at too low of a price, yet also not pricing their shares too high, which might lead to a weak trading debut. Meanwhile, both companies are hoping (and betting on) that the IPO window remains open early next year.

A steep correction in the stock market can occur at any time, closing the IPO window, as that's not an ideal environment for a private company to go public.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes the recent IPO frenzy is "unsustainable" and could lead to "many accidents."

Here is the case for ROOT:

- Very hard to get the license to be an auto-insurer, this is a strong moat

- Price has been decreasing so it creates a good entry point

- Less mature: they have not had the license for all states (but I'm sure they will). They have the license for California and it's the hardest state (also biggest market)

- Biggest cons: I read the reviews for their product and they seem bad. Would love to hear thoughts from people who use their products. I, unfortunately, don't own a car (I live in the city) so I can't try the product myself.


Here is the case for LMND:

- Everyone I talk to who uses Lemonade love their product

- Product seems more mature

- Price is picking and it will be more costly to enter at later stage


My investment philosogy: I usually don't put too much weight on earning multiples/net loss for young companies (unless it directly correlate to their business fundamentals). I think early companies should focus on creating their moat (ie. great brand, loyal customers) rather than making profits too early on.

Anyone have any thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which ETF to choose from these given choices? Hello everyone

I am from Switzerland and here we have the choice to pay 6800$ a year into a retirement account. That money does not get taxed and i save about 1800$ in taxes that way. This money can not be withdrawn until i am 60 or if i will buy a house or start a business.


Some new startups nowadays allow to invest this money in ETF too. I went with VIAC because they allow up to 97% of the money to be invested in ETF while most other have a 75 % max. Viac has a preset called "Global 100" and they advise to use it. Its very switzerland heavy though and i feel like switzerland is ruining my possible gains. Can someone pls give me any advice on which of these to pick, to get the best possible performance? Some ETF are limited by a max. percentage i can choose.



This is Global 100 recommended by VIAC:
[Factsheet](https://viac.ch/wp-content/uploads/VIAC-Global-100-DE.pdf)


This is what im currently using and i made 28 % profit since i invested 6800$ in april. I feel like a lot more couldve been gained since then.


These are all the options, percentages and product costs i can choose from. It only lets me use just a percentage of each. If i choose too much of one, it sometimes limits me using another. For example Crop S&P 500 is 35 % max. and nasdaq 100 is also 35 % max. If i use 35 % of Nasdaq 100 though, it only lets me use 25 % of S&P 500. 


I think it only limits me within categories. I can use 35 % Switzerland and still use 35 % Nasdaq 100 and 20 % emerging markets. 


I can always use about 40 % of CSIF World ex CH hedged - Pension Fund Factsheet, no matter how much % of the others i am using.

Are there any free websites/services/platforms which can automatically analyze DCF for stocks? I have been looking for it and found some sites like gurufocus or finbox but I do wonder about others. I also got some excel spreadsheets but the more advanced ones require me to find and put around 50 fields manually and also do plenty of extra calculations, it's just too slow to be of any use if I am supposed to compare plenty of stocks this way._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Micro focus the UKs Palantir?

Got any other high conviction picks for the next 3-5 years, feel free to list them in the comments...._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice/tips on what to do with my vested employee stock options? Hey guys!

I work for this up and coming company that recently IPO'd. I was offered 16,300 options at a strike price of 4.50 2 months ago, and somehow the company is now at 9.00 per share. My 16,300 shares fully vest after 1 year and things are looking quite well for us as we expand internationally... My question is what are my tax implications here, what is a good strategy (i.e. should I sell right after a year if things get even better), do I sit on it for longer... what are things I should be keeping top of mind after the full year?

Cheers! Sincerely, a genuine stock option noob._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “Passive Indexing is best for 99% of Americans” /yawn That other thread is quite scary how many awards its gotten for unoriginal content. Ever heard of Dr. Michael Burry? In that you guys will create an indexing bubble? “Its guaranteed profit of 6.5% annually after inflation! Compounded gains of double your investment every 7 years! Theres no risk or downside, go 100% on equities! Everyones doing it! Why aren’t you?”

I didn’t really learn anything from that thread. “Passive indexing is right for 99% of Americans”. This has been said and brought up so many times here and youtube. These threads are regurgetated and spammed so many times, you might as well be a Robot.

Please come up with new thoughts and ideas, instead of spammed Mantras. Try for once in your life going against the grain or the herd. Oops wait this is Reddit... aka Hive Mind._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
