Amazon reports sales growth of 37%, topping estimates. Is there any end to this mammoth growth ? The company already valued at $1.61 Trillion and still growing as it's a start-up, fucking Insane. India has a GDP of $3 Trillion which makes her the 5th largest economy and it's growing 5-6% per annum. But here we have the Amazon.com valued at $1.61 Trillion and growing above 30% each quarter. I know, I know it's foolish to compare a company with a country but the serious question is, how long it can continue to grow with the same pace ? 
Somewhere in 2018-19, Jeff Bezos said, one day will come when Amazon will go bankrupt as a retail company doesn't last longer more than 30 years. By his judgement only 10 years are left for the company but I don't see it go anywhere in next 30 years. But anyway, I guess, he is the man who created this empire and only he knows what can go wrong.

Netflix (NASDAQ:[NFLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX?source=news_body_link)) has jumped 3.7% as it's set to implement an expected U.S. price increase, [bumping its most popular standard plan to $14/month](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features?source=news_body_link).

That's a dollar higher than its current $13 plan.

Accordingly  it's also moved its premium subscription (which allows for ultra  high-definition quality and four simultaneous streams) to $18/month. The  lowest tier is set to stay at $9/month.

The  new prices kick in immediately for new subscribers, while existing subs  will see the higher prices roll in with their billing cycles in coming  weeks.

Netflix raises prices on a  country-by-country basis, and says the hikes don't affect each other.  But observers who track the pace of increases were expecting Netflix  might act to raise U.S. prices early in 2021.

The  increase was signaled during last week's earnings call, when COO/Chief  Product Officer Greg Peters said "You heard from Ted \[Sarandos\] the  number of original productions we're doing, increasing even under these  conditions ... if we do that, we feel like there is that opportunity to [occasionally go back and ask, for members where we've delivered that extra value in those countries to pay a little bit more](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3624015-netflix-call-subs-dipped-expected-production-full-steam-ahead-updated?source=news_body_link)."

A rise to $14/month puts Netflix's most popular  plan almost at parity with HBO Max ($15/month) - which launched at a  price point that some observers thought might be too much for a  streaming service.

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ticker Discussion - MIC - Macquarie Infrastructure Corp Hi,

MIC currently presides in the special situations bucket as the company is undergoing a strategic sales process.

I have a question only for those who have a in depth understanding of the company... but in the interest of providing a brief walkthrough for anyone who would also like to learn about the idea, I shall elaborate a bit on the situation...

**Walk-through**

MIC is holding company owning 3 distinct/unrelated operating businesses... These are 1) liquid tank terminal business (IMTT) which charges contractual rates to storage various industrial/petro/commodity liquids in the tanks terminals; 2) Fixed-Based Operations for airports (Atlantic Aviation), which provides fuel filling and ancillary airplane handling services at airports; 3) Hawaii regulated gas utility and LNG (MIC Hawaii), which is a gas utility company in Hawaii.The three businesses are all up for sale after MIC ran into some trouble in 2018 in the IMTT business and cut dividends. Though IMTT has recovered, the company ran into problems again on all operating fronts as covid engulfed the world. MIC responded with cost-cutting measures which saw a complete elimination of already reduced dividends. These events has since decimated the stock as an MLP and a dividend yielding name. In Oct 2019, the company announced a sale process for all or any individual pieces of MIC....

The attraction for the stock lies in that all 3 operating businesses are fundamentally sound from a long-term perspective and all are on the trajectory of recovery even in the current environment. Second, a consensus has emerged in recent months that a SoTP valuation indicate that the company is undervalued, though a catalyst will likely lie in an actual sale - which has yet to materialize.

If the above run-through is intriguing to you, I'd invite you to delve in depth and arrive at your own conclusions. I hope you found it useful.

**My question for those are familiar with MIC - Tax Leakage**

Can anyone elucidate on the topic of tax leakage upon disposition of any of the three businesses? I've heard that the leakage could especially be an issue for the aviation business (is this because the carrying/book value of AA is small compared to where it could be sold ? I have 1.3 billion in equity value for an AA takeout / $14.95/sh). how do you calculate or account for tax leakage in your after tax calculation of value?

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon beats, Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 expected, Revenue: $96.15b vs $92.7b expected (CNBC) Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

"We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to "make the jump to $15."

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's "other" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

Edited for clarification_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bullish on Callaway (ELY) Following the acquisition of Topgolf, Callaway shares tumbled 22% as many investors felt it overpaid for the sports entertainment company at ~42x 2019 EV/EBITDA. Following the completion of the deal, Callaway plans to issue 90mm shares to existing Topgolf holders which will bring the total shares outstanding to roughly 184mm.

From a technical standpoint, the combined annualized EBITDA based on Q3 financials would be $416mm ($348mm Callaway, $68mm Topgolf). The new enterprise value will be around $3.9bn implying it currently trades around 9x its NTM EBITDA. Compare that with its top publicly traded competitor Acushnet (GOLF) trading at 18x. Not bad.

From a fundamental standpoint, I think Callaway/Topgolf is going to struggle the remainder of the year due to Covid (they are currently operating at 85-90% capacity) however long term I see a great opportunity for growth. For those that have never been, Topgolf is fun as hell and  although expensive, I personally believe it’s going to continue attracting an audience that would never consider “golfing”. There are many new projects and LOI’s in the works and are expecting to do $3.2bn in revenue by 2022.

To me, there’s no other company like it now which can make it challenging to value, especially with uncertainty around the ongoing pandemic.

Boeing Co. is selling new bonds to help repay nearly $3 billion of debt, announcing the sale just minutes after a downgrade to the company’s credit rating.

The planemaker is issuing $4.9 billion of unsecured notes in four parts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The debt sale was announced in a filing earlier Thursday, just minutes after Fitch Ratings put out a report cutting Boeing one notch to BBB-, the lowest investment-grade rating, with a negative outlook.

The proceeds of the sale will help repay $2.8 billion of debt, which is either in the form of commercial paper or term bonds due next year. The longest portion of the offering, a 10-year security, will yield 280 basis points over Treasuries, after initially discussing around 300 basis points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.

Boeing abandoned a forecast that it would stop burning cash next year and said it would eliminate an additional 7,000 jobs, almost doubling its planned cuts, in reporting third-quarter earnings this week. The company has burned through about $22 billion in free cash since March 2019, when regulators grounded the company’s best-selling jet after two fatal accidents.

It’ll likely be another two years until Boeing’s financial metrics are more in line with that of a credit rating one level higher, Fitch said in the report. The company is also rated BBB- with a negative outlook at S&P Global Ratings, while Moody’s Investors Service has it one step higher.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is just one article on how the film industry is changing, but there seems to be some bigger implications if we dig into this a little bit, especially for Amazon - 

&#x200B;

During the last several decades, movie releases seemed to be very cookie-cutter for the major studios. 

Studios invest the money to produce a movie, hype the pants off it with front-loaded marketing, then release to theaters hope the traction / viral effect supports the various sources of money they draw in after the fact (ticket sales, movie purchases on home release, merchandise, licensing, etc). 

&#x200B;

With covid, major studios are at a cross roads on how to monetize block-buster movies. There was already a big shift taking happening - but the death of the box office release gave it a big push and this is all happening NOW without much news coverage. 

&#x200B;

Warner Brothers, Paramount, etc, seem to be selling off their big movies to the highest bidder because they expect Box office / "in-theater" releases to flop as far as realized profits with audiences either avoiding or being locked-out of theaters. 

&#x200B;

In MOST scenarios where a business (film or otherwise) cannot take it's product or service to the customer physically during Covid, instead they would be best served by releasing it themselves digitally - direct to consumers online either as pay-per-view or their own in-house membership/streaming 'netflix-equivilent' service. This type of approach makes sense because there is no intermediary "middle-man" company taking profit they could otherwise retain for themselves.

&#x200B;

While that would generally be the best practice in theory, the digital streaming space is complicated and fragmented. 

People do not want to pony up 15$ to watch a movie on each new release when they are used to paying that monthly for unlimited access. 

Similarly, if Paramount or one of the other studios has their in-house 'netflix-equivilent' streaming service trying to pick-up subscription revenue, with a low title-count, consumers are not going to be signing up for 5-6 of these different streaming services, hyped block-buster release or not. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right now, these trends seem to have one of two inevitable outcomes - 

1. Studios stop attempting expensive block-buster movies, hollywood takes massive hit and downturn, and instead streaming services double down on cheaper content
2. The 100 Billion dollar entertainment industry marches onward.. instead of vertical releases they sell Block-buster hits out-right to companies who can property monetize them

&#x200B;

I don't think the desire for high-production value, virally popular movies is going away any time soon, and given the major film studios are sort of throwing in the towel already on their own vertically integrated streaming / release options - there's only really two content buying behemoths positioned to make it work.

For expensive Block-buster movies, buyers really come down to Amazon and Netflix... and for some niche children's titles maybe Disney.  

&#x200B;

This certainly isn't a "Netflix is going under" post, but the Borat release seems to signal quite clearly that Amazon, with it's marketplace advertising and higher value per subscriber, cross selling and long-term plan, can and will ultimately will be able to pay more than Netflix will be able to for great titles expected to go viral. 

&#x200B;

All Netflix gets buying an amazing movie is few more subscribers who's life-time value is basically limited to their monthly fee...

Amazon with it's marketplace draws in customers for it's ecosystem, and can monetize them in dozens of ways from there. 

&#x200B;

Amazon today seems to have better vision and understanding of the new film industry than the incumbent / status quo and we'll probably be seeing a transition toward a massive number of big movies release to prime subscribers instead of traditional releases. 

&#x200B;

As to whether this will move Amazon's stock price, not sure.. 

Could already be priced in but I haven't seen much discussion of this yet and it appears to be Amazons biggest growth opportunity right now given digital content has such high margins._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cost of currency hedging I'm considering a global bond fund to my portfolio.

 **Shopify rallies after crushing revenue, profit estimates**

Shopify Inc. defied market expectations once again in the third quarter, posting stronger-than-expected results as the global pandemic continued to push shoppers out of bricks-and-mortar stores and onto online platforms.

Revenue at Canada’s largest company by stock market value nearly doubled to US$767.4 million while adjusted earnings were US$1.13 per share, more than twice analysts’ estimates of 52 cents.

“The accelerated shift to digital commerce triggered by COVID-19 is continuing, as more consumers shop online and entrepreneurs step up to meet demand,” Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said in the earnings statement.

 

**Key Insights**

\-Gross merchandise volume -- a measure of product sales flowing through its platform -- was US$30.9 billion, an increase of 109 per cent over the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong e-commerce spending by consumers.

\-The company continued to gain traction in new services it offers to customers. Shopify said 51 per cent of eligible merchants in the U.S. and Canada used Shopify Shipping in the third quarter of 2020, versus 45 per cent in the third quarter of 2019.

\-Its lending business is growing as well. Merchants in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. received $252.1 million in merchant cash advances and loans from Shopify Capital in the quarter, an increase of 79 per cent  from the amount received by U.S. merchants in the same quarter last ye

Shopify shares were up 2.9 per cent in pre-market trading at 7:52 a.m. in New York. The stock is up more than 680% in the past two years and had nearly tripled since the March low, as of Wednesday’s close, as the pandemic accelerated the push by retailers and small businesses to move sales online.

Founded in 2004, the Ottawa-based firm’s core business is helping retailers get online quickly and cheaply. But it has expanded to offer an ever-widening suite of services, including lending, payments and shipping solutions. With a market capitalization of almost $125 billion, the company is now Canada’s largest publicly traded company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GDP data for third quarter in: 33.1% increase This comes after a contraction of 31.4% in the second quarter.

I've been searching the web and reading up on this, but couldn't quite find a definitive answer._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Royal Caribbean Cruises Revenues down 101% YoY  

Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:[RCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCL?source=news_body_link)): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of -$5.62 misses by $0.67; GAAP EPS of -$6.29 misses by $1.27.

Revenue of -$33.67M (-101.1% Y/Y) misses by $42.38M.

The company expects capital expenditures of $0.5B for Q4 and $2.1B for FY2020.

The company expects to incur a net loss on both a US GAAP and adjusted basis for Q4 and FY2020._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to increase exposure to Consumer Cyclicals/Discretionary, given that we appear to be close to start of economic growth period? Accoring to available data, the US appears to be 2-5 months away from the start of vaccine distribution to the general population. We are anywhere from a few weeks to four months away from a meaningful stimulus package, on top of the trillions of dollars that have been already released since March this year.

Given this expectation, and knowing that the Consumer Cyclicals tend to outperform the broader market during a time of economic prosperity, is now a good time to increase exposure to this sector, or indeed, make it a core investment in our portfolios?

Some key data (source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-discretionary.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-discretionary.asp)): 

* Consumer discretionary is a sector classification of non-essential  consumer goods and services.
* Consumers  tend to spend more on consumer discretionary products in economic  growth phases, which are usually characterized by higher disposable  income.
*  Often, when signs of economic recovery begin to appear, consumer discretionary stocks will lead a stock market recovery. 
* Consumer Cyclicals has a big exposure to Amazon (10% to 23%, depending on the ETF), retailers, resorts, autos, cruise lines.

If we compare Cyclicals ETF SPDR XLY to the popular Vanguard VTI, we see the following:

* 10 year performance annually:  17.64%  vs. 13.48%
* YTD performance: 18.20% vs 3.43%
* 1 month performance: -1.93% vs  -3.57%

Recent performance suggests investors are optimistic about this sector, but it doesn't look overbought, relative to some other sectors like IT, at least.

Some considerations:

* Large exposure to Amazon.
* The virus might impact the services sector for longer that anticipated, hurting Consumer Cyclical brands.
* Cyclicals have already outperformed the broader market about 15% this year.
* If you're already invested, then selling the previous ETF is a tax event.

In summary, Cyclicals are interesting at this point in the economic cycle. If the markets fall any further, I'm planning to replace my core S&P 500 ETF with a Cyclicals ETF. Maybe the optimal point would be March 2020, but it's easy to see it in hindsight. I think it's not too late for this switch.

Someone on Bogleheads did an analysis backtesting a worst case scenario where an emergency occurred during a severe market crash (2002, 2008), where both investors lost their jobs and had to rely on either their emergency fund or stocks (100% VTI/VTSAX). The person who had to rely on stocks did better than the person who had an EF over a 20 year period. Obviously best case scenario where both investors maintained a full time job, 0% cash / 100% equities beats x% cash  / 100-x% equities.

So it seems that cash really is trash. Even in situations where you need to deploy a lot of funds immediately, you can use credit for that, and then just pay it off after selling stocks or wait until next pay period. 

Another benefit of not keeping cash is that it also protects you from people asking for loans. Can't give any loans if you barely have any cash in the first place. It's probably useful to always have some cash on hand, but not so much that it covers 6-12 months of living expenses?

Over the past 5 years I've developed my own way of investing in the stock market that seems to work well for me, so I'm not really looking for advice here, but I would be really interested to know how other people decide which stocks to buy and when in current stock markets.

How exactly do you determine which companies you want to have in your watchlist?

And then how do you determine when is the right time to start buying certain company's shares?

What kind of research do you do, and which tools do you use for that research?

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Manufacured Home Comminities Decks Hi -

I'm very interested in MFCs. Counter-cyclical, low cap rate, room for consolidation, catches on tail winds of suburbanization and modularization.

Has anyone seen any really good decks, prospectuses, etc. which provide a great market overview? 

I know this isn't out there but if a Blackstone or a McKinsey covered it - i would love it. 

Platinum for any Platinim quality resources!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Q3 Earnings Forward Guidance I am looking for information on companies reporting this month, specifically if they issued 1 year forward guidance. 

Does anyone know where to find this information? 

The only information I have found so far was this article from Fortune, but it only has information from Q2 earnings.

Q3 revenue was $5.10 billion vs $5 billion expected.
Adjusted net income per share was $1.12 vs $1.09 expected.

Stock is up 1% in after hours after a 4.8% drop today.

Feels like the right time to add to the position for a long term investor. The digitalization of payments and their continued investments in tech will continue to deliver value.
