 What kind of bond etf yield should I aim for in my situation? First off, I'm a bit new to investing. I have 80,000 euros that I'll likely need in the next 3 years or so because I'll have a low income for a while. (I'm starting a busisness).

I want to safely invest this money. What I know about bonds is that there's a duration until the bond issuer pays back the principal investment. And I know that when interest rates go up, bond prices fall. So the higher this duration, the more risk I run that interest rates go down further (then they already are) and then I would lose money.

But I don't understand the exact risk. 

So what's a yield I should aim for in my situation? 

I have 3 etfs here that I like.

A corporate bond etf:
https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000M65V&tab=1&InvestmentType=FE

A government bond etf with 1-3 year durations:
https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000HYCO&tab=1&InvestmentType=FE

A government bond etf with 3-5 year durations:
https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P00008HJ3&tab=1&InvestmentType=FE

The corporate bond etf has the largest yield. Then the 3-5 one and then the 1-3 one. How much riskier are the corporate bonds? What's the chance that I'll lose money in the next 3 years with those? 

Alternatively I can get a 0.15% yield on a high interest savings account. Would that be better? Are bonds even worth it with the economy the way it is now?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your current undervalued stock picks? What are your stock picks for 2021?

Privatization deal will get voted down because subpad offer! This stock will skyrocket after because the only thing weighing it done is this deal! Dorel Industries Will Be Among The First To Benefit From Continued Growth Of Cycling Market

Dec. 23, 2020 12:12 PMDorel Industries Inc. (DIIBF)

Summary

The popularity of cycling is going nowhere, partly due to increase in social incentives.

The company has a strong enough balance sheet position to outpace competitors.

Earnings estimates suggest that the company is trading at a fair value.

Dorel Industries, Inc. (OTC:OTCPK:DIIBF) is a relatively unknown Canadian company that produces an interesting mix of products including home furniture, bicycles, and baby products such as strollers, car seats, and swings. The company is well-diversified as each category of products is separated into many different brands. For example, Dorel's sports division owns brands such as Cannondale and GT. The company sells its products to basically every region in the world, including Latin America and Asia.
The company's stock has increased 1000% since the March crash despite not having paid a dividend since late 2019, and this uptick was mainly fueled by the company's success in the sports category. We hold a bullish view of the company; we believe that Dorel's position in the bicycle market will continue to grow due to changes in consumer trends as a result of COVID-19. The company also has a strong enough balance sheet position to outpace competitors in terms of production and innovation, and its other revenue segments operate in markets where demand will continue to stay steady.

(Dorel Industries - Google Market Chart, 2020)

Biking grew increasingly popular during COVID-19, and this trend is here to stay

In "Dorel Sports, demand for bikes continued to spike, as families were looking for outdoor activities that are safe (Dorel Quarterly Report, 2020). Although the company credits short-term reasonings for the continued success of its bikes, we believe that this trend is here to stay for the long-term.
￼
(Statista, 2020)
Firstly, the overall demand for all kinds of biking has gone up, whether it be mountain biking, off-trail cycling, or road biking. Consumers will have different preferences based on the availability of certain terrains within their neighborhood. Dorel Industries is extremely well-positioned to capture consumers in all areas because it has 9 different bicycle brands that each cater to a unique customer segment.
We believe that Cannondale, which is a higher-end road cycling brand, will see an uptick in sales especially during early spring of next year, as new consumers who picked up biking in urban environments during COVID-19 were deciding whether or not to lock in their long-term interest in cycling before buying a bike at a higher price point. Moreover, these consumers may have been using lower-end bikes during the summer of 2020 because higher-end bicycles were basically sold out everywhere during the pandemic.
All the other brands that Dorel owns should see growth as well, as consumers look to capitalize on a full summer of outdoor activities. Other brands include Schwinn, which produces electric bikes, and GT, which focuses on mountain and off-road biking.

We believe that biking, in general, will see an increase in the long-term because of the social aspect that has been introduced to the sport. Strava, which is a social media app that allows users to show off their exercising events, saw a "33% increase in uploaded activities over the last 12 months." We believe that the euphoria that consumers get from Strava interactions such as sharing, liking, and commenting on posts, matches the feelings consumers get from traditional social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram. Therefore, biking enthusiasts, whether old or new, have an extra incentive to participate in the sport.
Only 34.5% of the company's sales came from the sports division, which suggests that the company has lots of room to grow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the ideal trailing stop loss percentage? Just executed my first trade with a trailing stock loss, and have it set to sell automatically if the stock goes beneath 20% of it's all time high. 20% was selected based off of limited internet research, but it occurs to me that someone must have done some extensive research and there has got to be a formula for determining an optimal stop loss percentage strategy.

I’m doing a lot of research into what sectors / stocks I’m going to include and one is AstraZeneca.

This isn’t a final decision yet I’m still looking at it’s competition however I’ve stumbled across something which I feel someone who long term invests could help me with.

When you compare the US AstraZeneca market you will see that the cost of 1 share is currently $48.90, however the UK costs £72.53

Is this due to the FX impact? If you look long term at the charts and compare them you can see how they both follow the exact same pattern/trend however there is minor differences which I am putting down to fluctuations in currency exchange and things like that. Would this be correct? Or would I be better off sticking my money into the US version since it is seemingly cheaper, would that be more beneficial to me? 

Sorry if this is basic, like I said I am a swing trader and this is my first time looking to expand, I’m not used to analysing stocks in this particular way so I’m not 100% sure what is going on and what would be better if doing if I did decide AstraZeneca is the stock I’m going for.

Am I missing something?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dorel Industries Privatization Deal diibf dii.b I think true investors will find this interesting.  Back in April, I decided to get back into investing because the market was low.  My wife suggested investing in bicycles.  I did some research and I found Dorel Industries Diibf and it was trading for .98 USD / share.  With a market capitalization of around 30 Million.  Dorel industries own Schwinn, Cannondale, Mongoose, and GT.  That only makes up 1/3 of their portfolio.  The rest is made up of Dorel homes and Dorel juvenile.  How is a company that is doing almost 3 billion in sale only have a market cap of 30 million.  I started calling around and I was finding that bikes were selling out everywhere!  Huge upside with little risk.  They literally had more cash in the bank than their total market cap.  So I took a home equity line of credit and bought a decent amount of shares.  Fast forward 7 months, the stock has skyrocket to $12/share.  Then the company announces they have reached an agreement in principle to sell the minority share holders stake for 11.17 USD/share.  I started think it all makes sense.  The value of this company has been decimated!

Now the founding family is pushing HARD for the minority shareholders to sell their share at no premium to the trading price and publicly stating they have no desire to sell theirs.   They have been using fear tatics to get us to sell.   It all seams like something more going on.  My fear is as soon the company goes private they release a new path they are taking the company.  Maybe something to compete with Peleton?  Some of the top shareholders have publicly stated they believe it is a lowball offer and they are voiting against.

Does anyone have more information on this?

Has anyone ever seen a deal voted down by minority shareholders?  What was the company and what happened to the stock after the vote.  My thought is that if more than half the minority are unwilling to sell their shares at that price despite the boards desperate attempts to convince them.  Also all of the class A shareholders are unwilling to sell.  Wouldn't that automatically cause the stock to increase because now you have more than %75 of the company confirming that they are unwilling to sell their shares at that prices.  Does this create a floor for the stock price with only upside?  Please provide insight if you have any.  _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to bet against US dollar long term?

Like many of you guys I started about 3 years ago and I've since come up with my own investing style that has beat the index for this year. I invest in companies that have **explosive growth potential** and I base my investment thesis on fundamentals and financials, then choose the right time to enter the market at the right valuation. These criteria have helped me in filtering out the noise, pump and dumps and speculative actions in the market and I thought I'd share them and also ask you guys what are your criteria for picking companies?

For fundamentals, it's actually simpler than what most people think:

1. Does the company have a prototype and how much better is it compared to the existing products (unless it's a completely new tech)? If the product doesn't even exist and is not much better than the competitors, then there's no point in investing in that company.
2. Does the product have scalability? This comes after criterion 1 as coming up with a product is easy but being able to produce the product at scale is a whole different ball game. Try projecting sales if possible. 
3. Does the company have a 10x path? This requires all the big questions like is the industry they are in growing, is the company growing, what are they invested in, does regulations allow them to grow 10x?
4. Leadership. It's important there is a great leader and I look at how long they have been with the company and what are some important decisions they have made. Bonus if the guy is famous and has a star effect like Elon Musk <3.

For Financials, it's not incredibly difficult, and it can vary for most people. A few metrics I like to use are:

1. Current Ratio: How much they currently own/how much they currently owe. (Current asset/current liability)
2. Trend of gross margins: Indictor of future profitability once the company turns profitable.
3. P/S ratio compared to competitors in the same industry: Tells you the current market valuation vs annual revenue (ttm) and therefore if the company is overpriced. Must compare to other peers in the industry as how "Expensive" a company is, is very subjective.

Do not look at factors like P/E Ratio as that is impossible to use on high growth companies as the market will most likely assign their future expectations of the stock.

For looking at right price to enter, I just use the simple fibonacci tool to look at price targets based on previous trends. If there is negative news that doesn't really affect the fundamentals of the company (e.g. Company CEO has a scandal), it's also an great buying opportunity.

That's about all you need (I feel) to beat the market. Sounds easy but it takes a lot of homework and practice.

What criteria and methods do you guys use to evaluate companies? Do share it in this thread.

Hope you guys invest safe and remember, money never sleeps :)

P.S. I do have run a channel what I analyse stocks based on my own criteria to save people time, let me know if you're keen but I will not be posting it here to comply with the group rules.

I'm looking to invest my gains in a smaller tech company with more upside.  Two that I've been tracking are A10 Networks and Magnite.

Magnite is a service that facilitates buying and selling of online advertising space.  It seems very relevant right now and they should have significant demand.  However, others have thought the same and they're up 270% this year and 62% in just the past week.  Market cap is about $3.6B.

A10 Networks sells datacenter management applications.  I think highly relavant in these times with more remote work and as companies move to the cloud.  They're up 45% over the past year and 17% over the past week.  They're market cap is $$787M.  And, they're profitable.

I think Magnite is a more compelling company, but I'm worried about where the stock price can go after the growth it's seen in the past year.  A10 looks more compelling to me.  Stock price has not skyrocketed over the past year and they have a lower market cap.  I'd think they'd have more room to grow.

I’m happy with my allocation. But I still don’t quite understand how to make the shift to lower risk investing as I approach retirement down the road (I’m currently early 20’s so I have time).

Is exchanging the total market funds proportionally into the bond fund the main way to do it?  Should I put it into more diverse holdings like a gold fund or REIT?

Celgene went on a buying spree prior to the merger. In 2018 they spent billions on [Juno Therapeutics](https://www.celgene.com/newsroom/cellular-immunotherapies/celgene-corporation-to-acquire-juno-therapeutics-inc/) and [IMPACT Biomedicines](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180107005114/en/Celgene-to-Acquire-Impact-Biomedicines-Adding-Fedratinib-to-Its-Pipeline-of-Novel-Therapies-for-Hematologic-Malignancies). 

Gilead spent more than 30 billion on buying up companies in 2019 and 2020. You can see a detailed list of a Gilead’s acquisitions in [Part 1](https://www.griproom.com/fun/it-looks-like-gilead-is-about-to-merge-with-roche), and how each one relates to Roche (the company that is probably trying to buy Gilead.)

You might be thinking, okay but they couldn’t have been planning this merger for years, right? That would be crazy.

Nope. That’s exactly what they did.

Celgene management knew this was coming, because they’d been organizing it.

It seems this merger had been planned for more than a year. So if you’re expecting the management of Gilead to come out and defend the stock price…don’t.

It didn’t happen with Celgene and it isn’t happening with Gilead.

I wonder what would be the tax consequences of capital gain distributions for these ETFs, or at least a rough estimate of them, with a taxable account.

I am aware that ARK Invest has a pretty high turnover in their funds. Because of this, the majority of distributed capital gains is likely to be subject to short-term capital gain taxes. You can find ARK Invest projections of the 2020 distribution on this link:

[https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/1\_Download\_Files\_ETF\_Website/Performance-and-Other/Capital\_Gains\_Distribution\_ARK\_ETFs.pdf](https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ETF_Website/Performance-and-Other/Capital_Gains_Distribution_ARK_ETFs.pdf)

If I understand well, when a distribution occurs, the NAV is reduced by the same amount. With tax-deferred accounts, you can reinvest the entire distribution and you will not lose anything. However, with a taxable account, you need to pay taxes on these distributions. I am in California and short-term capital gain taxes can be nasty (around 50% in federal and state taxes for high income earners). Although ARKK distribution will be only 1.75% of the NAV this year, high earners would have to pay around 0.7% of the NAV in short-term taxes. This does not seem like a lot, but in a less favorable scenario where the distribution is 10% of the NAV and all gains are subject to short-term capital tax (a bit extreme and unrealistic case, but hey... who knows...), you would need to pay 5% of the NAV in taxes, which sounds horrific to me.

What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market Correction EDIT: Don't sell you portfolio. I never said that. Just buy assets that do well in downturns.

\----

Although I'm not one to attempt to time the market; I think a crash or correction has to happen within the next few months. The majority of indicators tell us that everyday Robinhood investors are putting much more money into stocks than they are worth, which means they won't see enough returns and it will have to correct itself. It's pretty clear to me that not enough people on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) or [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) have learned about bubbles from reading about the Tulip Bulb Crisis, the South Sea Bubble, Japan in the 80s, the Roaring 20's, the DotCom Boom, or the Mississippi Bubble. We have so many examples in history and yet everybody and their mom is posting rocket emoji's and thinking Tesla is undervalued.

Most of us probably lived through the Great Recession, but I don't think that's comparable. If you were around during the DotCom bubble, you know the way people talked about PLTR, QS, and TSLA is the same way they talked about [Pets.com](https://pets.com/), or [eToys.com](https://etoys.com/).

Some indicators, to look for:

**Buffett Indicator:** Market Cap/ GDP Ratio

* Market Cap/ GDP ratio tells us how much value we place on the market, over how much it's actually worth.
* The general market is more overvalued than it was during the dot com boom
   * This is likely due to the fact that everybody has a 0 commission trading app like Robinhood but nobody knows how to value a stock or read market indicators anymore.

**Corporate Profit After Tax vs S&P 500**

* There has never been such a large gap between Corporate Profit and the S&P 500, and it is likely due to the Coronavirus wrecking profits, but everybody investing before we miraculously fix the economy and are profitable again.
* We're not going to fix the economy so well that we will reach the level of value we've placed on the future.

**PE Ratios**

* PE Ratios in general are getting ridiculous because people keep buying stocks which increases the price, but that purchasing is way outpacing Earnings.
* Companies aren't going to make enough to earnings to make up for the value you placed on them.
* *Almost Everything is overpriced.*

**Fear and Greed Index**

* The fear and greed index hit 88 on December 4, and if it hits something that high again, you can be pretty sure.

\---------

Expect this new coronavirus strain or a soft blow of wind to knock this stock market back to realistic levels at some point in the near future.

Now I'm not a financial advisor, so i'm not going to recommend anything but I personally am looking into TZA and alternative assets until the market corrects itself, as well as continuing to add to my 401k and IRA as always. I'm just warning everybody that we are at ridiculous levels of overvaluation, and it's time to take those earnings and make safer investments imo.

The more rocket emojis you see, the more sure you can be that i'm right.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MWK: Undervalued AI Company to Appreciate 10x by 2021 Year End I am bringing you guys an AI play that is absurdly undervalued with a large runway for growth: *Mohawk Group (NASDAQ: MWK)*. 

**Overview**

Mohawk uses AI to identify e-commerce market trends, which they use to launch, advertise, and sell the most desired consumer products. Their technology, dubbed “AIMEE”, synthesizes tons of data to identify new opportunities, launch best-selling consumer products, automate marketing, analyze existing consumer product brands, etc. MWK’s tech reduces go to market timing by \~70% and is highly scalable. Over the past 3 years, headcount hasn’t changed but revenues have increased significantly (50% CAGR since 2017).

**E-Commerce Presence, Industry Opportunity, M&A Strategy**

MWK is currently on Amazon (95% of revenue), Walmart, Shopify, and its own websites. E-commerce is obviously one of the biggest megatrends right now. The vertical is expected to grow at a 14.5% CAGR, increasing from $4.4 trillion in 2020 to $8.1 trillion by 2025 (Statista). Seller presence is extremely fragmented on Amazon, giving MWK tons of consolidation opportunities. Music to our ears. MWK has a big focus on inorganic growth, acquiring brands around 3x - 4x TTM EBITDA. These are immediately accretive, as generally no headcount is added and integration expenses are low (MWK only purchases the listing, IP, assets, and/or relationship with the manufacturer). In other words, MWK aims to acquire smaller consumer product companies and scale them with AIMEE. As inorganic growth is historically a main driver behind multibaggers, and AIMEE has proved effective in organically growing product demand, I am excited about the business model management is building out.

**Valuation**

Mohawk is currently trading at 3.47x TTM revenue, a drastically low valuation for a high growth company. The market has mispriced MWK as a pure consumer products company. MWK is bound to re-rate closer to tech valuations as investors start to discover this gem and realize the proven AI tech that management has developed. 3.47x is very low given MWK’s high revenue growth and upside potential. Let’s conservatively assume MWK reaches a multiple of 12x 2021 revenues. Management guides for $290mn revenue on the low end. At a 12x multiple, this is a $3.48bn market cap.

In other words, that is a conservative **upside of 720%**. 10x is entirely reasonable from here. I could go on and on about this stock, but I’ll just cover a few more things.

**Insider Buying and Gaining Institutional Ownership**

There has been lots of insider buying, indicating that management is confident in their business. Very positive sign, as they obviously have a better idea of the upside potential.

Additionally, institutional ownership is low. This is because MWK is too small for big investors to own shares substantive enough to influence their fund's performance. Once MWK becomes a bigger company, institutional ownership will continue to increase, coverage of the stock on the sell side will expand, and more investors will know about it, propelling it even higher.

**Summary**

Mohawk Group (MWK) uses AI to identify and sell the most desired consumer products on e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon. The stock is currently mispriced as a pure consumer products firm, rather than a tech company. In tandem with the below, MWK should re-rate in 2021 and reasonably give investors 10x upside.

* Strong revenue growth expected to continue (likely >50% next few years)
* Management focusing on margin expansion
* Gaining market share in the growing e-commerce industry. Mainly through its accretive M&A efforts. Consolidating a fragmented space.
* Significant insider buying
* High probability for institutional ownership / increased sell side coverage once mkt cap gets a little bigger
* This is a chance to get in on an undervalued small-cap with a proven business model, megatrend (AI, e-commerce) exposure and low institutional ownership._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PFE VS BIONTECH.

Dominoes (DPZ) a pizza company starts focusing heavily on software and its delivery app. Stock shoots up \~20x since 2000.

Axon Enterprise Inc (AAXN) a company that focuses on weapons and law enforcement, starts focusing on cloud and SaaS. Stock shoots up \~20x since 2013.

Microsoft (MSFT), Satya Nadella replaces Steve Ballmer as CEO in 2014. Begins to diversify microsoft into cloud, SaaS, and so on. Stock shoots up by 5X.

Micro Devices (AMD), Lisa Su takes over as CEO in 2014, AMD begins releasing microprocessors that are more advanced than Intel's. Stock shoots up 20X.

And lastly I'm assuming the recent huge run-up with Game Stop (GME) is due to the new CEO having plans on transforming it into an eCommerce/eSports company, especially with their recent partnership with Microsoft.

Are there any other companies that you believe has the potential to transform themselves in the coming years? If so which ones?

Hey everyone, super short DD. I came across this company Bluebird (Ticker BLBD). This is a legacy bus maker with strong connections to school districts across the US that reported fairly strong earnings (check them out on seeking alpha, don’t have a link for you). They recently announced they were expanding production capacity to 1000 electric buses to meet growing demand. They most recently sold 158 electric school buses this year and announced on call they were off to a great fiscal 2021 with 80 orders in backlog. They also noted they have been delivering electric zero emissions buses for over two years now and they are not a startup. They have pretty strong cash flow, they already service many school districts not only with buses but parts as well. I am thinking with 1000 electric buses coming in this environment (Environment - where companies that have delivered nothing in electric vehicle  space are worth 10-15b+). At a measly 450m market cap this company is well positioned and could definitely see multiple expansion and is just fundamentally undervalued (electric vehicle company with p/e? Weird to even talk about that when valuing these companies). I can’t imagine this company is not going out of their way to produce expand electric school bus production if there is not demand, places like California are already going all electric. Chart looks really clean.

Always just my opinion, but love to share! Not financial advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions on ABML Hey all, I'm fairly new to investing and decided to try putting a small amount of money into TD Ameritrade to see how well I could do with more volatile stocks rather than my normal Morgan Stanley account that is fairly safe since it's holding pretty much all of my money for college. Anyways on 12/01/2020 I decided to buy a few shares of the stock ABML because I had heard good things about it, and after doing some research realized it's actually a very interesting and promising company. As of today I've had a 60% increase in value, and earlier today more than doubled my shares right before another increase. I'm debating whether to sell or hold, and I wanted to know your opinions on this stock! Thanks for reading!
