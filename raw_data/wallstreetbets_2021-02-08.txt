 VANGUARD SENT LETTERS TO MY HOUSE AND MY MOM FOUND THEM Holy shit. I don't even know what to do at this point. I started up an account with them on the 1st and put in 90 bucks, I didn't even trade any stocks yet, I was still researching them. I pussied out with GME and AMC so that money's just been sitting there. But they sent to my house three whole letters with my legal name right on them for her to find. She made me open them up and let her read them. I'm so fucked. If she finds out I've been trading on Coinbase I'm gonna be beaten. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm getting a real job asap and moving out of this fucking dump.

Since seeing the GME thing build up through the front page, I've been following your mission and for the last couple of weeks noticed Robinhood ads popping up and usually with a large number of awards attached. 

1) is just browsing your posts really enough to get targeted?

2) who do they think they're trying to fool?

3) is it just me or did these ads appear around the same time the class action was submitted (and is there any news on that)?

Thank you all for the quarantine entertainment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My best GME gain porn. $1,295 --> $959,663 in just over 3 weeks. Sold because of brokers blocking buy orders. Sorry _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You Were Always Going to be Holding the Bags GME buyers were given two amazing gifts.  The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.  Oh and the people being critical of you trying to pump GME a second time, the ones you call shills?  Those are usually WSB vets.  The ones telling you to diamond hand, and to buy more, you'll notice that those are the new members, those are the shills.  They desperately want you to pump so they can unload those bags on to you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EWJ breaking out Started following this because Burry tweeted something about Topix possibly breaking the "iron coffin lid."

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The path of least resistance, and most gains. **Alright retards, it's time to get into the next biggest movement in our lifetime and make some no brainer tendies, Clean Energy. (CLNE)** 🚀🚀🚀

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) 🚀🚀🚀

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

&#x200B;

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

"Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome "[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

Exit strategy: "What's an exit strategy?" - u/deepfuckingvalue_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey Robinhood! How ‘bout you let us sell fractional shares for the retards who switched to a different broker I finally dropped RH last week and wouldn’t ya know it, RH still wants to fuck you over.  You cunts won’t let me sell the .9 GME because it’s a fractional and you won’t transfer it because it’s a fractional.  I also can’t sell it at all because my account is deactivated.
“but retard, sell it as cash”
You’re not listening or reading you dumb ape.  Account deactivated. No selling.
“Submit a request you retard”
Yup.  And wait 3 days to be informed I have to reactivate my account, transfer funds to make it a full share, sell that share, move the cash back to my bank, then close my account.  FFS._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BioNano Genomics - Why you should care about it First of all, I'm not a financial advisor and I like certain stocks more than others.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[Dr. Gordana R. from Children's Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596)

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

Thanks and good luck to us all!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir: My P.A to Bears, Bulls with 0 Hope, Myopic Analysts, Cramer, and Big Daddy Institutions The amount of heresy being preached about Palantir really is a sight to behold huh. 

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, "it didn't hit $40, fml". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

PS: Fuck **Jim "Once a Shill Always a Shill" Cramer**. That Indecisive, Bi-Polar Clown. 

PPS: Drop a heart for Mommy Cathie. This women lead me to the promise lands with my poor $800 acc (17 btw) and helped turn it into $2k plus

Thank you :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Since Td Ameritrade is owned by Charles Schwabb would it make sense to open a fidelity account for short term trades instead If I already have a Charles Schwabb account for Long Would you guys think it's a good idea to go with TD Ameritrade or Fidelity seeing as I already am holding long shares in my Schwabb account?

Only reason I am asking is bc CS owns TD Ameritrade and I don't know if that could cause any issues in the future (reeling from my Robinhood Burn, hence my concern)

But from what I have seen the Think or Swim app seems really good while I don't know much about Fidelity other than they are both the Top 3 of recommended trading platforms. Any advice would be appreciated!

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn’t keep up.  Something like that, I don’t really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don’t have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That’s what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can’t make promises because I an amateur and I’m not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I’m just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

TL/DR: Understand how digital securities are going to change the securities markets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A big thank you to WSB I would like to thank this community for getting me to start trading. After finishing business school i was disapointed at the entire prospect of working in my field (PR and Management) as most entry positions were either complete bullshit or nonexistant. I went to make a career out of my hobby, videoediting. Its been a successful career and ive gotten to a point where im well off enough to be able to throw some money around without risking much. Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650€ - a measly 1.25 shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work. Now i can see this as a potential source of additional income for my family and myself. So thank you WSB!!!

All the best to all of you!

D_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to 💎🙌 when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🚀🚀 $NOK to the Moon 🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME in a nutshell MEME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Finished my DIY project just in time for GME to 🚀🚀🚀🚀 (percentages simulated to show movement in the video) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NOVAVAX - Is closer to a traditional vaccine

I don’t want to sound like r/investing, but I was surprised at how many new comers seem to believe the stock market is literally rigged against them... that just isn’t the case.

I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. He was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. He tried this on other outlets but was always told “that’s too risky” “most stock pickers underperform” “you are better off buying index funds”. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

If you came here because you thought GameStop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. We take big risks here, but again, we know they’re risky and we know what we should be doing— in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you’ve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it’s how most people are able to retire these days. 

Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang).

Is that that tendie da gaffer was on about? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please.

[https://investors.ideanomics.com/sec-filings](https://investors.ideanomics.com/sec-filings)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. I still think CLNE is a strong play and will be adding to my positions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it’s better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says "there is no options flow today" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow’s main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

Feel free to tell me why I'm stupid.

THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.  

SGMO TLDR 

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it’s a good stock are exact reason why it’s a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, "I don't wanna but good luck all".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, "how reasonable does this seem"?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a "how to judge random idiots on the internet" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BlackBerry this is a song for you.  

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say

The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine

The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
"Disruption of the court", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out "fire!", then came Suzi  
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi  
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her  
Both up state for attempted murder

Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to "meaningfully enhance shareholder returns" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

Like a sensible "investor" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking "what's the fastest way I can make my money back?". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the "old days". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the "old days" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

Real quick, lets just clear the air. WSB has ALWAYS been filled with assholes and degenerates. DFV took his beatings the ENTIRE time until it paid off. WSB doesn't play nice, if you post expect to be ridiculed ruthlessly lol.

That said, his name is DEEPFUCKINGVALUE. He did DEEPFUCKINGVALUE plays, I'm talking warren buffet level 4-D chess lol.

He didnt chase trends. Or buy something because someone told him so. He was ruthless and logical in his belief that AT THAT TIME, it was a very intelligent decision.

 Be like DFV. Unless you're a degenerate gambler ready to lose it all. In which case...whats your next play? (Legit asking)

Edit: Disclaimer i dont own ANY stocks or options right now, waiting for a play. No bias for or against GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

“SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!”

“YEEAHHH!” -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Serious question about robinhood Hey guys, I asked this on r/robinhood already and got a quick ban because it pertains to me getting off of robinhood.

Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn’t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven’t fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you’re like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don’t expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage.

And is it possible to maybe save one? So I am a smooth brained ape who got into the squeeze without fully understanding it like most.

So I know I will get stoned for this but what if we just focused all our efforts on AMC. What if we all moved out position to AMC I was thinking considering the price difference we could still make some significant volume changes if we all moved positions. To be clear I am in both GME and AMC but personally I believe AMC is the safer bet in the long rung with or without the possible squeeze. So what if all us Ape just focus on getting AMC to the moon.

Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.

First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.

I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.

**Okay here we go:**

I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.

**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week’s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.

**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**

First observations:

\- 2020 amazing year.

\- Dip Q3 2019.

\- Good year 2018

\- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.

\- Bad year 2016, again something changed.

Please note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:

\- Stock price stays above MA-Simple (50) line despite any dips (Positive)

\- Growth in P/E ratio (Negative)

\- February has on average been a strong month. So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).

**Step 4, Ownership.**

**Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better. We don’t look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.**

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The game is rigged but 💎✊✊✊ can still win! Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this "insane"? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 900% gain and rising _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [X-post] I painted this to commemorate these strange times, for all of my fellow apes. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Underestimating the Hedge funds - PART 2 (part 1 on profile) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will AMC jump in price?

Hate Hedge Funds & Wall Street - Why Not End Them All?

With so many users on WSB, there are many point of views about Wall Street and the market.  However, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes Hedge Funds and the big players who have trampled over retail investors to make a living.  

Considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be "invested" in the stock market. The problem is the financial system and Wall Street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  Even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $GME, it eventually works in their benefit.  The value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.  

The Financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the Gold Standard(which had problems due to Bretton Woods) and 1977 amendment of the Federal Reserve Act.  Ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the Federal Reserve's mandate of "maximum employment" causes Fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  Ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and Congress.  Wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really the.1%), and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  Again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  This structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  If you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.  Pestakeholder.org has a report titled Pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had "suffered" almost 600k job losses! 

The monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  They have more power than Congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  The Federal Reserve is just an extension of Wall Street - the NYFED is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank CEOs or members of their board.  These people are responsible for bank supervision...  

I saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $GME position.. It was titled: "This is for you, Dad". They were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  Their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. Along with millions of Americans.  

The Federal Reserve has created an economy for the Big Banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  In fact, the Office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you FOUR banks control 155 TRILLION of the derivative market while ALL OTHER BANKS control 23 trillion.  

The 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... Try 16 trillion(Google GAO audit) or 29 trillion(Link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  The Fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and AIG.  These emergency facilties were managed by... WALL STREET.  In fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given "non-competitively" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  The Fed can just say these are "unusual and exigent circumstances" to bypass that.  They paid Blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  I think PIMCO was over 100 million too.  Then BofA and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  The banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  They received trillions in lending by the Fed - Citigroup had the highest total at 2.6 trillion.  They literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the Feds balance sheet.  It took the Fed 10 years to unload all of their "Maiden Lane" MBS purchases.  

Present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations. 

From Wallstreetonparade.com 
"If the Fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans. After reading the F-SOC revelation, we searched the New York Fed’s website for hours to see if it had ever made a public statement that it was going dark on the dollar amounts of its repo loans. We finally found this statement dated June 11, 2020:

“Beginning with this month’s release, the Desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business day’s operational details.”


The Fed's cumulative loans from Sep 2019 to mid March 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  Half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  However, as WSOP points out from the F-SOC the big banks are currently using 2.5 trillion of loans.  These are typically overnight or a few days. 

None of this is transparent because the NYFED is a corporation and is not subjected to FOIA - The board of Fed is but I tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the NYFED conducts the lending and facilties.  So, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(Board) of government.  




Alright, I could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. Let's get to the point.  

The only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  The only way to achieve that is to stop using Dollars... Also practically impossible.  However, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  It's imperative.  Investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems IF many people actually committed to this.  If a few percent of Americans did this the banks would have huge problems.  

Nothing is going to change until we address the Federal Reserve.  Anything less is just a *game that won't *stop the pillaging of avg Americans from this industry.

BUT your investment is still $100...So until you sell your shares for cash, you didn't lose or gain anything. My ape minded opinion. 

Still holding GME cause there's still action and staying green in the other micro investments.

Also, favorite app/platform for trading stocks not on the normal Apps? Looking for a few canadian companies that aren't "supported yet"..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout "market manipulation" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on "updating data".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff

Here's the email he received.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn’t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn’t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I’ll resolve your ticket but I’m still here if you reply."

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say "oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more "accurate" measurements to our users". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

His post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

And for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

This beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3

This is their response:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5

So their excuse is a "programming error". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, February 8th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Monday GME is gonna feel like 💎💎💎 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Weekly Stock Market News🚀 | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]🚀 **The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs🚀🚀🚀 Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out🚀🚀🚀 Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November 🚀🚀🚀

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% 🚀

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square 🚀

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 🚀

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 🚀

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 🚀

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company🚀🚀

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

I'm looking for a (serious) discussion and you're more than welcome to prove my logic wrong.**

The much anticipated FINRA report is published tomorrow after market closes. We're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. However, the way I see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their main strategy is one  of these two:

Case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. If they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. If this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. Their survival relies on retail investors selling due to FUD. All of this falls apart if FINRA reports a high short interest  tomorrow. Their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. If this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. The estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. It went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and I wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. In other words, even in this case the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. Otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). Essentially, if the FINRA report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. The hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.

TLDR: FINRA report bad, stock collapses (possibly momentarily) on Wednesday._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some gains to brighten up our day (still holding BANG) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME megathread for Mon 2/8 Quarantine zone, enjoy!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Unpinned Daily Discussion Thread for February 08, 2021 Your daily trading discussion thread.

Where once I was fooled, I thought the **Jackals** were only on one side, I now see many who have left the path to join with the other Jackals. Stray from the narrow path to the moon and **get eaten**. The Jackals are always hungry and don't understand why, they will say anything for a meal, anything for you to come and join them, **in their misery**.

In truth it could actually be so much **easier, if we were one**. If there were no jackals. But this is the path we find ourselves on and a **hard truth** we must accept. I made a **little money** on my rocket to the moon but what I really gained from all of you I met on the path was **much wisdom**. I see that this little movement you guys made that could easily reshape the world, has quickly been turned by jackals into a **dark unfriendly path**. Much like the others before it. 

**Holding** onto that which **no longer serves you** does you no good. The jackals convinced you the bag was full, now you look and see that it is empty. Pesky jackals. If my right hand should bind me I would **cut it off** and be free and seek fresh opportunities, perhaps one day the flow might come around again, perhaps not.

I see you Jackals, I am listening, I am watching but I will not join you. Find another meal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD **Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. 

**Summary**:

California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys – I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.

PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement

PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.

Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  

1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  
 The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. 

2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  
 $PCG’s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  

$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER—see item #1. This wouldn’t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  

This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. 

3) **Dividend and Leadership**  
 $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022—not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) 

Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it’s not like they’re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer’s Energy which was known for safety. She’s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock—I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). 

4) **Wildfires**  
 Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn’t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings—great entry point.

**Potential** **obstacles**

There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won’t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.

Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There’s always the potential for additional fines, but they’d be pretty inconsequential.

Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E—like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there’s that.

**MOAT –**   
 Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there’s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.

**WHY WSB?**

Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you’re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.

**EDIT:**
Thanks for all the comments/feedback.  

**RE: $PCG hatred.**  
Hatred 100% valid—it’s not going away.  They’re pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.  
It’d be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn’t need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It’s a monopoly.

**RE WSB u/ DD**
u/angela_lansbury busted me.  I’ve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users. 
That said, as long as I finally have a forum—I have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can’t tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I’ve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks.
My DD was tribute to this group.  I think there’s a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged—everyone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility’s coffers.
This isn’t a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it’s an investment I believe in.  I’m long on $PCG, but I also think there’s going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Su Cycle of (bae) AMD: WARNING TSUNAMI tendie alert!

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

How the fuck does that person know what wallstreetbets was like before 2 weeks ago (I dont know what it was 2 weeks ago)

Just because they're saying shit you want to hear doesnt mean they're telling the truth or have alternative reasons for posting.

I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.

I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.

Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

* Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK
   * Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK
   * Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots
      * While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.
   * Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next
* Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.
   * I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.
* Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?
   * You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * "Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!"
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 "paperhand pussies" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum
* Denying Reality
   * S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.
* Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions
   * When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN
* Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* I want to gag every time I see somebody write "I'm not a financial advisor" following a post that makes that very clear
* Moving the goalposts
   * "YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!"
   * "We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).
   * "Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!"
   * "Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!"
   * "Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!"
* Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page
   * which you then posted again
      * and again
* Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * Market Manipulation --
   * No Pump & Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * Political Bullshit -- If you think "it's not about the money" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by "This is not financial advice, am ape") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.
      * Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.
* Gain & Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.
* YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.
   * [not a fucking YOLO -- it's a picture of a billboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la96zj/my_amc_billboard_is_up_in_kalamazoo_mi/)

* And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.

You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?

If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.

But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.

But there’s some geopolitics behind this. 

There’s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. 

This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.

How? 

By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. 

The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it’s “now or never” before China reaches peer state status.

TLDR:

- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.

- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.

- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue

PT $1,000 Maybe rare with all $GME posts which is support fully but I also like hearing about other positions. I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they’re going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla’s auto business: has a lot of potential and there’s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they’re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they’ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.

Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it’ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.


Tesla Semi: this is one I’m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer.


$TSLA TO THE MOON._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In 2018, FINRA fined Interactive Brokers $5.5m for naked shorting. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Still took a lil profit _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Violent demand incoming for uranium - why Cameco CCJ Over the last 10 years, uranium prices have fallen like a rock. They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil 🛢, gold 🏆, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it’s time for that to turn around. [Excerpt](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-has-slammed-the-energy-sector-heres-a-hot-commodity-that-could-keep-rising-51589536800):

*Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.*

Uranium isn’t like oil, you can’t buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We’re at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see [this chart](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium) from the last time uranium went to the 🌕 from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:

*Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: "History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production."*

So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.

What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you’re subscribed to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.

Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like **Cameco (ticker $CCJ)**. It’s been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We’re not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so **it’s not going anywhere**. Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, you’ll see the same for their revenues.

Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose. That’s why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.

&#x200B;

**"Ladder"** is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates.

&#x200B;

*Legal Laddering ex:*

>***Bond Laddering*** can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. The idea is to separate CDs, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different "ladders" (or "buckets" or "baskets") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.  
>  
>This strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. Generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline.

>***Short Put Laddering or Bull Put Laddering*** is a unlimited profit, limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term. To setup the short put ladder, the options trader sells an in-the-money put, buys an at-the-money put and buys another lower strike out-of-the-money put of the same underlying security and expiration date.

*Illegal Laddering ex:*

>***IPO Laddering*** also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. This artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price. **This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse**.

OK that was fun. We know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in "Laddering". We know that IPO Laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.

Now in the more in-depth version of the "Short Ladder Attack" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how "Naked Shorts" can be combined with "Laddering" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. This is effectively what the blogger coined as the "Short Ladder Attack" strategy.

\------------------------------------

>***Naked Short*** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  
>  
>***The Anatomy of a Short Attack*** — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  
>  
>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill–gotten gain.

>  
>When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

\------------------------------------

tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for "short ladder attack" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a Laddering price manipulation tactic combined with Naked Shorts. Both of those things are things.

I'm pretty retarded so I can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. You'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.

Yes, the concepts described in the "Short Ladder Attack" article are real things. You can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all "laddering" via shares neither party actually owns.

No, that doesn't mean that's definitely what happened w/ GME.

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Kalamazoo man has paid for digital billboards referencing the Reddit group WallStreetBets and the short squeeze of hedge funds that have been occurring with stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.

Photos of the Save AMC billboard at the Wings Event Center are going viral on social media.

Brett Reath, the man behind the billboards, says he is poking fun at Wall Street and wants to bring attention to what hedge funds have been doing for decades by shorting stocks.

The messages will appear for a few days during the morning commute and evening rush hour.

“I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of shed light on the situation that’s been going on,” Reath said.

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.

Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.

1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot.
2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years
3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!

My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.

Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.

&#x200B;

* DIS (The Mouse)
   * It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.

&#x200B;

* CVS (You know you want to do it...)
   * WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: "are the earnings already priced in?" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $2.50 in price over the last week alone ($71.50 - $74.00). I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.

&#x200B;

* MARA + RIOT
   * I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and "the halvening" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.
   * According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.
   * MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.
   * RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* CCIV
   * CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.

***This is not financial advice, purely academic.
I hold no GME.***_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29. 

If shorts settle T+2, and it’s only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor?

\#Innovation#

The company has been recognized for innovation; for example it has developed technologies that allow mobile phone batteries to be made at room temperature rather than in expensive, heated dry rooms.

In 2010, BusinessWeek ranked BYD the eighth most innovative company in the world [\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-businessweek-30) and that same year saw Fast Company ranking BYD as the 16th most innovative.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-fastcompany-31)

In 2017, PV Magazine has awarded BYD the top category of innovation on its newly launched battery storage system that advances progress in three categories: modularity, charging and discharging capacity, and efficiency.

TDLR: I think nobody talks about this company and feel price of stock will increase once more people start looking into other EV companies apart from the most popular ones.

Ticker: $BYYDY_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Future of Robinhood I’ve been thinking about what becomes of a broker that can’t handle the stresses of volatile markets. We have a system where the strong survive and the weak get devoured. It’s hard to imagine Robinhood will endure given the events of these past few weeks, so what becomes of them? Well, they have something of value, but clearly do not have the infrastructure or the know how to swim in the ocean with the other sharks. It is my belief, that they will be acquired, and if I had to guess? It’ll be Goldman. The shiniest white shoes on the street have expanded into the consumer market with Marcus, and their biggest rival, Morgan Stanley, just bought E-trade. Acquiring a retail broker makes a lot of sense, but Goldman has had a problem. Who could they buy? In terms of US based brokers, all the appropriate sized acquisition targets had been picked off, until now. I think it would be a win-win, because ‘Robinhood, a Goldman Sachs Company’ solves a lot of problems. No one would ever question Robinhood’s solvency again. Goldman would oust the ‘broker bros’ like Vlad that clearly are in way over their heads, will gain millions of accounts, and strengthen their position in the consumer market. 

*This is complete speculation, not financial advice, and you should draw your own conclusions.*

For all you lazy autists: 

TLDR: I think Goldman will buy Robinhood._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DIAMONDHANDS LETS GO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Tendy Approved Swing List For 2/8/2021 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Proper, Detailed DD On Options For This Week! Edit: Unity and Peloton are still slipping. While I still stand by them 100%, getting in later today is probably a better idea. I am sorry if you bought at 126 or so on Unity (though it is holding it), but it should recover this week. 

 Good evening, gentlemen. I present to those reading this a few options plays for this week that I'm pretty confident are going to print. Rather than holding losses, these couple of plays will likely give consistent 50-100% profits. I edited out the no-no words and crude jokes after auto-mod keeps taking this down...whatever.

1. Chegg ($CHGG) puts.  

Chegg has been running up to an ATH ahead of earnings. As noted in my last post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg\_cheating\_chegg\_putsa\_decent\_opportunity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg_cheating_chegg_putsa_decent_opportunity/)) , their guidance generally falls short. The stock is currently way overextended, and with the somewhat-near reopening of schools, there will be a damper on their growth projections. I'm predicting a pullback to $95 or so.  

Suggested options: 2/19 100/105 put debit spread (sell 2/19 $100P, buy 2/19 $105P), OR purchase the 2/19 $90P


2. Unity ($U) calls--SAFE TENDIES  EDIT:Still slipping today a bit. Advisable to wait until afternoon or so to enter position 

As you may have noticed, Unity (software developer, about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech) took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it dumped 14% from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that, importantly, had several spikes to $140. There is still positive buying pressure.  
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, guess who bought the dip? CATHIE WOODS. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th. Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity, and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on Friday exemplify the buying strength. It WILL return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives.  

Positions: $U 2/19 $140C, 3/19 $150C.


3. Peloton ($PTON) calls--Trust The Woods  

Peloton was another company that had stellar profits, but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections. Revenue? Increased 128% to $1.06 billion. Subscriptions? Increased by several hundred percent each for their Connected Fitness as well as digital subscriptions. Your wife? Getting heftier each day, and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders. Peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like. Aside, do NOT forget they also are acquiring Precor, giving them a solid footing in the post-Covid gym ecosystem.  
What happened to the stock? Again, like Unity, dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections. It also nicely recovered during the day (I managed to get in at $143, hehe)  
TL;DR? Peloton's bottom line is not affected significantly. Their growth is explosive, and continuing to rise. Cathie Woods again acquired another tasty 106,200 shares for ARKW. What does this mean? If she buys the dip, you need to buy the dip too.  

Suggested options: 2/19 $150C, 3/19 $165C


4. Twitter ($TWTR) puts.  

As in October...and July...and April...and February...and the October before that....Twitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10%. Why did it do this every time? Slowing user growth, as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue (they stopped running election ads) meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time. Now? People are (likely) leaving Twitter in droves. I had some info here about why, but I'm assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after I say the name of the former President, so I'm just going to leave it at that.  
Technical analysis? It's been running up to an ATH. The potential for it to dump right after earnings is INSANELY high--all it needs is a slight blemish on projections. And I'm pretty sure there will be many, many scars on their projections.  
On the flip side, their profits will likely be very good. Thing is, I simply do not see how banning the former President will help their bottom line and growth projections. Let me know what you think about this below.  

Suggested options: heck, why not 2/12 $50P for $93. You could do a longer date and higher strike, but honestly, either it dumps or it doesn't.


5. ArcelorMittal ($MT) Calls--steel gang isn't done yet  

The reasons for purchasing $MT and other steel stocks such as $VALE and $CLF have largely not changed. However, most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $X's brief rocket to $24 before pulling back...and then doing an offering.  
The normal reasons still apply--demand is high, supply is low, new infrastructure projects on the way, etc. This is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence, and giving some momentum back to the stock. Plus, the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low IV, so it doesn't hurt to toss a little money at it. But to be clear, this is a much less assured play than the 3 I have already listed.  

Positions: $MT 2/19 $23C for $66. Could also just YOLO a 2/12 call on Wednesday at market close, should cost around $30 each


There are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well. Disney, GM, Uber/Lyft, Enphase. I might also do some weekly $DIS calls and ride the run-up to earnings, and then sell before earnings as positive Disney Plus news might already be priced in with their Investors' Day fireworks.

In any case, I might post some more DD on other things I find and research.

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward.

With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Conservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. 

But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.

Edit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29. I believed the company had too much downside at those prices.

for the love of god please dont delete this posts just trying to help us all make more money_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $API (Agora) - No need to draw trend lines or fibs, as it’s just a vertical line on the daily and weekly chart thanks to Clubhouse. Blasting through to triple digits tomorrow. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sentiment shift & theory. Just a thought but I’m guessing as the GME price dropped we lost a lot of the new degenerates.

This is the lowest active number I’ve seen in the sub in a weeks, and futures just opened up so I would expect the old school degens to be here.

Anyone have reliable data points we could make a chart with and see if the price drop lines up with the shift in sentiment that from ‘diamond hands’ to ‘lol bagholders’?

The futures are green, you’ve gotta love this dividend stock on an uptrend momentum _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is AMC at the current price ($6.83) a good deal? Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

Thank you GME!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME FINRA short volume data We  have a bunch of posts that base some theories off the FINRA short  volume data. This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:

If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice ([https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)) they state that the data:

"(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not—and is not  intended to—equate to short interest position  information. "

In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)).

For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/))   - \~61.8Mil -  for the week ending 1/15 does not match either the total   short volume reported by FINRA (for all exchanges) - \~84.5Mil- or even   just for NYSE - 24.7Mil.

Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.

For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.

WSB used to be a fun place for people to share their trading experiences good/bad and interact with people who have gone through the same situations, and felt safe posting in a community that understands. Recently the community has gone through some changes with the large amount of new users joining. It’s weird cuz I made a post with outdated info about GME and they were all very quick to tell me I was a retard and how they hated seeing GME posts and whatnot. While I read these many hate comments by these professional investors who know everything, i think to myself “why do they even bother to comment on a GME post if they’re sick of GME?” The more I think about this the more confused I get and the more I realize I may actually be retarded.
