 replicating ARK ETF success I saw an interview of Cathie Wood and she spoke of her strategy to hold shares in companies growing over 20% per year.  Here are my holdings of companies growing over 20% per year in revenue:

ROOT, DASH, AI, OZON, LTRX, ABNB, CERT, SFT, PLTR, TLS, NGMS, YSG, WNW, and MASS.  (11 of 14 IPO'ed in the last few months)

What stocks are you holding with 20% / yr revenue growth?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Private stock question I just got a text from a friend of mine. His uncle owns 42 shares of MetLife from the 1940's. I don't really know any other details, but was wondering if there is a way to value those stocks? Would they become common shares when MetLife went public at a 1-1 rate?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are you guys buying LEAPS on? Wondering what people are super bullish on for the next 1-3 years. I was thinking ARKF but a financial advisor i’m related to talked me out of it. Anyways, what stocks/etfs would be best to buy LEAPS on in your opinion?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SLB Stock Advice I currently hold shares of SLB (Schlumberger) stock. I was an employee and took part in their stock purchase plan. I purchased the stocks years ago at a much higher price than they're worth now (sitting at a 53% loss now). I made some bad decisions holding them for too long.

Does anyone have any advice for what to do going forward with them? I'm wondering if I should hold them or if they're likely to go down even further. I'm not in any hurry to cash out. They're the only stocks I own and the dividend was cut this year from 0.50 to 0.125._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Beside Warren Buffett, are other big investors also in cash in these times?

\-James Simon  
\-Ray Dalio  
\-Abigail Johnson

I read that  Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett ) ended Q3 with $145.7 billion in cash. It would be helpful to know if other big investors are also sitting now in cash. Does anybody have any information if other big investors and smart money is now waiting or in equity?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Roboadvisor? Hi guys,

Beginner here. Only been investing for about 4 months or so. I've been using \*a popular investing platform\* but I'm not sure if that's what I actually want to continue using. I spend more time than I'd like looking at my phone and trying to understand the market and what I should do (the answer is often nothing). So, I'd prefer to have a robot manage it for me. I'm aware of the fees associated and think it would be worth it. Thoughts or recommendations?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Technical analysis question Good afternoon guys. I’ve recently gotten more into charting and TA on top of fundamental trading. My question is that when looking at RSI from one chart to another, it seems to change. One says 76 and the other, 81. I realize both of the these are overbought but that seems to be a big difference. Any reason that two sites would have two different readings? 
Also, if RSI is overbought but MACD is good, resistance is broken, and the stock is out of all channels to the positive, how important is the RSI? As I know that RSI is somewhat secondary to other indicators. Thanks to all who read through this and thanks in advance  for responses._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A message to Chamath Palihapitiya - do your job! Your chairman of Virgin Galactic Go to the “All-in Podcast” on YouTube and go 5 minutes in and watch Chamath’s response.

The biggest concern to me now is Chamaths behaviour.  Watch how he acts when he is asked about selling his 4 million shares.  He says nothing positive about Virgin Galactic.  Literally the guy asking him the question has to say “and you still own a significant owner of the business and you believe in the business”

Even then, says nothing positive about the business.  He seemed very uncomfortable 

Why hasn’t he publicly talked about Virgin Galactic?  The only time he does was when he’s selling shares.

https://www.ft.com/content/09aca2f4-3413-448b-8b5b-c82040371238

Do you know when he last spoke about Virgin Galactic?  (Besides the recent announcement of his shares sold).


July....

... snd he’s the chairman of virgin Galactic.  His job is to represent the shareholders best interests.

He recently did a interview (check it out I posed it here.). He shows no excitement and says nothing positive about virgin Galactic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why has $MGM mostly missed out on the recent online sports betting run up? Stocks like $PENN and $DKNG have 3-4x their pre covid values while MGM has just reached their pre-covid price. 

What am I missing here that makes a stock like PENN so much more attractive? MGM has built a nice looking online/mobile sportsbook that is ready to roll out to new states as betting is legalized. Plus they have more healthy financials at current valuations.

MGM appears to me like a great entry point if you missed the recent run up but want to get in on the future of sports betting. Somebody tell me what I'm missing here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividend Kings List FAQ Which stocks are in the Dividend Kings?

I am new to investing. I saw that Unity did IPO this fall and price seemed to spike up. I am thinking about investing in it and buy a share or two :D. Is now a good entry point to go in? Or should i wait a bit? 

Been looking at it for some time, but i cant find a good entry point or i miss it. I am a bit worried that after all the IPO hype price will drop by quite a bit. Saw that ARKK bought some more stocks this friday, so meybe i should jump in on monday, aka asap? 

I am kinda new to reading stock price rising/falling, so im worried that price would just keep rising without any meaningful drops.

Any advice would be appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What happens after a short squeeze? Tried looking it up online but nothing really was clear for me.  

So short squeeze is when people try to make up for their losses on betting a stock would drop.  

But after that whole process, what generally happens to that stock?  

Does a short squeeze indicates a huge drop after the short squeeze?  

Thanks in advanced._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good long term dividend stocks that I can get into? Do you know any good long term growth and dividend stocks to buy. Especially, but not limited to, in clean energy. I plan to hold for a few years and add more as I go. I also want a few different ones to diversify.

So the UK nations have announced a series of new lockdowns and restrictions sparked a by prevailing strain of covid that's apparently 70% more infectious and is causing a rapid rise in Englands cases.

I'm interested to see how the markets reacts to this on Monday, do you think it will be big due to fears of it spreading to the US or just a minor blip since we still have a vaccine on it's way.

What are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $YELP an overlooked rebound stock? With the world going back to normal, people will begin going to restaurants and going on vacations. Also, a possible CARES act for small businesses could send advertising way up. Is Yelp a possible winner that’s being overlooked? Am I missing something? What are your opinions of this stock?

What‘s your acronym for the next 5 to 10 years?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Square and draftkings I definitely see square as a e-commerce play along with banking. I knew squares banking side(opening a bank next year). But they are using small businesses brick and mortar stores and integrating it into square system. It makes it way easier for small businesses than with competitors because they are part of squares whole ecosystem. For example, when you look online at places like Walmart, target, Best Buy and they say they have 4 in stock.. you get to the store and it’s not there. It’s because there are two different systems which is why we see that so often. But with square the small businesses will have all there information in one system. The square ecosystem. It makes it a one stop shop for the small business because you just use there ecosystem for all your businesses needs. Square is an absolute beast. I see them going up at least another 5x but I can see them going 10x in the next decade or so. 

Draftkings, on the other hand seems interesting it might be worth it to open a small position since there CEO is saying they will be looking to expand into other areas and not just stay in sports gambling. I don’t know much about them besides online sports betting. Would have to do some DD.

If a stock dips in the after hours is it expected to dip once the trading day begins and vice versa?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'm going to take a big position in Nintendo next week, is there a bear case? I have wanted to buy Nintendo stocks for 3 years (since I bought a switch and became a bit of a fan boy) but my broker does not offer Nintendo Co. Ltd (NTDOY) unfortunately and I am not a fan of having my finances split between many brokers. But today I gave in and have just opened up an account with a new broker, so on Monday I should be able to finally buy in and hold for many years.

I am really excited about buying Nintendo stocks and have really come to love Nintendo during the last 3 years. I never played any Nintendo games prior to owning a switch so this is something very new to me. I absolutely love the Switch system and over the last 3 years I have been playing great games like Mario Odyssey, Captain toad, Animal Crossing and Mario Galaxy + many others. Yesterday they released a video of Miyamoto showing off the Nintendo World Section of Universal Studios and it looked gorgeous. Also the switch has been showing off impressive sales numbers this year and all these owners are now in the Switch-club and will also be buying games in the future.

Some of the things that should be in store for us in 2021- 2022:

* \- Nintendo World opening (4th of February)
* \- Mario 3D World Bowsers Fury (12th of February)
* \- Monster Hunter Rise (26th of March)- Pokemon Snap (no release date)
* \- Breath Of the Wild 2 (no release date)
* \- Switch Pro (Not confirmed, total speculation)
* \- Other speculations (Galaxy remaster, Zelda 35th anniversary, Mario kart 9, Metroid Prime 4)

BUT since I am probably biased when it comes to Nintendo I would be very interested to hear the bear case as well, why I shouldn't invest in Nintendo, what potential downsides are there?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.

# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**
*****
> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 — a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.
*****
> Even with this year’s sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.
*****
> Those in CNBC’s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.
*****
> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.
*****
> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.
*****
> “The shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It’s nothing like what you saw in the spring,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. “It’s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.”
*****
> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.
*****
> # The week ahead
> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla’s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.
*****
> “We’ll see whether or not there’s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it’s absorbed within the S&P,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.
*****
> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. “At this point, the vaccines are stimulus,” she said.
*****
> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday’s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.
*****
> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.
*****
> # First-quarter speed bump
> “The first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there’s the potential for some negative outlooks. “I think we’re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.” Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.
*****
> Fundstrat’s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he’s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.
*****
> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it’s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.
*****
> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.
*****
> “The January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it’s close. It’s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,” said Krosby.
*****
> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.
*****
> “But I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it’s pretty clear you’re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don’t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,” said Bank of America’s Harris.
*****
> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.
*****
> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.
*****
> “Given the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it’s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,” said Arone.
*****
> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don’t have solid earnings streams.
*****
> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.
*****
> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.
*****
> In the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.
*****
> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.
*****
> “If you put stimulus like that into the economy that’s open, that’s a big boost,” Harris said.
*****
> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed’s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don’t.

> # An Overbought World

> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

> # Leading Indicators Positive

> Leading Economic Indicators for the month of November came in higher than expected this morning, rising 0.6% versus estimates for an increase of 0.5%. One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.

> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**

> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.

> # Real Santa Claus Rally

> Stock Trader’s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.

> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days

> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).

> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.

> # Wretched Retail Sales

> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn’t enough, October’s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October’s report.

> Breadth in this month’s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don’t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online– all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.

> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # Chart of the Year

> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. “One thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don’t bet against several more years of new highs.”

> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We’ve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here’s the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.

> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is a good place to learn about the stock market? How did you all learn? I want to learn as much as I possibly can. I’m a 20 year old college student majoring in economics though I’m not able to take classes for my major yet so I am not able to learn in class at this moment. 

How to invest, what to research, HOW to research, what am I looking for, etc. I want to learn all I can about the stock market in order to be more comfortable investing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why should I bother with a fundamental analysis? I’ve starting investing this summer, as I’ve had some extra money lying around. I started with a small portfolio and have been consistently revising/growing it as I’ve been learning the basics of stocks and what sectors I want to be a part of. My strategy has been mostly technical; looking at past patterns and predicting future patterns, along with following Reddit to follow/ride the hype. In addition, my strategy is to invest in sectors that I believe will be a big part of the future (Renewable energy, EV, information technology, healthcare, etc.). 

I’ve been doing pretty well in the past 3 months (up about 35%) by using my strategy and following this Reddit community. So I guess my question is; why should one use a fundamental analysis strategy when most of the big winners don’t necessarily have the best fundamentals? What’s the argument for picking stocks based on their fundamentals rather than their hype/ growth potential?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Graduation gift of 10k Exxon stock Hi there! I just graduated college and my gift from my grandfather was 10k worth of Exxon shares. 
    
My sister got the same gift four years ago, and obviously the worth has gone down significantly. My whole family is telling me to leave it alone but I’m worried I’m letting it sit in a bad place. 
    
Any and all tips would be appreciated. Again, I know absolutely nothing about stocks and I’m trying to learn. If you know of good websites or apps to use I’d be very appreciative._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ESP plan worth it? My employer just offered an ESP plan with a 15% discount. That 15% discount is taxable as income, which in the discount is actually 11-12% after taxes. Money accumulates for six months and the trade is made at whatever the price is on the first or last day, whichever price is lower minus the 15% discount. 

Seems like I could take that same money over the six month period, average out and buy on dips and do far better than this. I don't see the stock diving or soaring much above where it is now.

Which is the better course?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How exactly are stock prices affected by buying/selling pressure? Quoting from [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com):

>Stock prices tick up and down constantly due to fluctuations in [supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp) and [demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp). If more people want to buy a stock, its market price will increase. If more people are trying to sell a stock, its price will fall. The relationship between supply and demand is highly sensitive to the news of the moment.

This is all fine and clear. However, I'm trying to get a better understanding at how this actually works more precisely.

For every buyer there is a seller, and *vice versa*, so it's not just the amount of people that want to buy that affects the price. Rather, it seems to me the factor is how much the buyers want to buy compared to how much the sellers want to sell.

As far as I understand it (and I might be understanding very little here), if I buy something at the stated ask price, I'm not driving the price up or down myself, am I? The price would move if I wanted to buy something enough to be willing to put in a bid that is higher than the current price, in order to ensure a timely purchase.  And in the other direction, I would contribute, albeit negligibly so, to driving the price down, if I wanted to get rid of a stock enough to put in a low ask to ensure the transaction to go through. Is this correct?

Are there more accurate estimates/models for this sort of process? I mean a way to quantify how much "buying or selling pressure" results in a certain rate of increase/decrease of the price of a stock. Any available resource treating this would also be welcome._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Elon Musk Has Made Millionaires Out of His Most Loyal Fans https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/tesla-s-tsla-stock-price-an-army-of-millionaire-retail-traders-hold-on

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla’s stock. He said it was the first time he’d ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

Laura Goldman, 62, says New York-based analysts missed how much appeal the company holds for a younger generation that’s deeply worried about the climate crisis. Goldman, a former stockbroker, doesn’t even own a car — let alone a Tesla. She bought 300 of the company’s shares in the fall of 2010, a few months after its IPO, and picked up more stock over time.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

Thanks for the awards._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First post. I have some stocks I have an eye one. I would like some advice/questions from more seasoned investors. All the stocks I’m looking at have a reasoning behind them. EADSY, THBR, VERI, MYBUF, HNHAF .If you see anything wrong, or have any advice on how I should distribute the little I have to invest. I’m pretty confident in the research I’ve put in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE: TAK ): U.S. FDA Approves Supplemental New Drug Application for Takeda’s ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) for Adult Patients with Resistant or Intolerant Chronic-Phase CML This ticker symbol is under the radar,  which Cathie Wood is purchasing over the last 3 months without a single sell.

Note: I own shares in the company, and I am following this stock for a few months._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Opinions about spread betting (options, cfds) What’s wrong with spread betting a stock like Apple (relatively safe company)

Surely this can significantly increase profits (and losses) but for a company like Apple, I only see growth with minimal risk. I’ve tried with forex and it was a nightmare but stocks are a lot more down to fundamental analysis in the long term. Even spread betting something like S&P 500 could give you 10x the returns a normal investment would. For an equity that has consistent growth and profit, surely nothing is wrong with this.

I'm looking for shows that analyze companies, in general or go over quarterly reoprt of companies, tracking the market and give you pretty much the majority of things that you need to keep track of.

In her most recent interview, Cathie Wood was asked to name a stock or sector that she thinks can do as well as Tesla did and she says that it must be the genomics sector.

She also mentioned that she reduced how much she invested in the FAANG stocks ever since they crossed the trillion dollar valuation and thinks that the genomic revolution will form the next generation of FAANG stocks, as opposed the internet revolution of the past.

What sectors do you expect to invest in in 2021? 
Personally I’m looking into; 
- Charging network for electric cars 
- Cyber security 

Why these 2;

Charging networks
I believe the electrification of our cars just reached a point of no return with production cost per kWh getting closer to $100 making electric vehicles simply cheaper to buy and own than ICEs. 

I think the public charging network will so enormous demand spikes in the coming years! 

Cyber security

Is that really a bad thing for the investor? I’ve heard the argument that by relinquishing control of the market share they have, the parent company would be worse off, which I agree with. But there’s a second argument to made that by these subsidiaries spinning off gives you early access to a stock like Instagram, or YouTube, or Twitch, maybe even AWS or WhatsApp. It makes these stocks more appealing in my opinion for the long term investor.

So now for the more speculative/anecdotal.  The Oculus Quest 2 has become one of most sought after (and well reviewed) 'toys' this Christmas season... as hard to find as the Xbox/PS next gens.

Hello, wanted to ask you folks about a potential opportunity for 2021 - cannabis testing stocks, meaning companies that test cannabis for purity / potency. As more locations continue to legalize cannabis, we’ve certainly seen cannabis stocks increase... but testing stocks seem to have been left in the dust. See EVIO and DIGP. 

Do you think cannabis testing stocks are a good play for 2021?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain capital gain tax to me like I'm 5yo? I can't wrap my head around it. It seems if you GAIN less than 30k/year from stocks you only pay 12%. If you go over that it's 22% and quickly goes up to nearly 40%. However, if you hold for over a year you are never taxed over 15%?

So it seems for smaller sums it isn't that bad to buy/sell regularly? But for any big gains you'll want to hold for at least a year?

Also does that captional gain include my normal income? For example If I make 35k a year, then sell 29k in stock profits that year, would I still be taxed only ~12% for those stocks or would it be 64k in captional gains that year?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SBE Merger Delayed... Dump to Invest in VALE or no? I’m holding SBE at $21.75 entry and was hoping to ride the wave up to the merger than sell. However, the merger’s been delayed until 1/15 (was supposed to be mid-December) and I’m concerned it will stay flat until the merger and then drop a la [insert Sweet Pickled Assless Chaps* ticker that torpedoed post-merger here).

I’m also wanting to diversify a bit and invest in mining companies like VALE and MT. I’m thinking of selling off my SBE profit and investing in a mining company so that I can hold both. But, I’m also considering selling off all SBE to re-invest in mining (and possibly throw a bit of the money at an ARK fund). I could then reinvest in SBE after the merger *if*/when it drops. 

I’m not sure if this is wise as I’m unsure if this is *really* an opportune time to invest in VALE/MT or if the thorough, albeit very much rookie level research I’ve done has failed me.

Does this sound like a wise plan? Not asking you to look into a crystal ball. Just asking you to tell me if I’m a dumbass and if you see a glaringly obvious fault in my thought process?
