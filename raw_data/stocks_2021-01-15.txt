Hello,

I don‚Äôt really understand stocks, funds and which ones to choose from that I considered taking a course to teach me about stocks, bonds, mutual funds (ETFs) what they are & how they work. Another course I may take as well is intro to stock options so I can a better understanding how it all works.

I know everyone has their reasons as to why they invest into stocks etc. Those of you who have experience, is it even possible to pay off your student loans with investing on the right stocks? Has anyone ever done this? How did you learn?

Any advice would greatly be appreciated. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Biden didn't talk about clean energy in his 1.9T stimulus plan. Clean energy stocks down a lot (ICLN -5.39%, TAN -7.24%, QCLN -5.57%). Is the bull market for them over? Is it going to trade down or sideways this year? Why did the market react so harshly to the lack of talk about clean energy? Was it an overreaction or the beginning of a larger term trend for the rest of the year? Classic buy the rumor, sell the news?

Yesterday's stimulus plan is only the first of two major spending initiatives Biden will seek in the first few months of his presidency.

The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect‚Äôs longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combating climate change and advancing racial equity.

Surely the hedge funds and very smart money must have known his other bill was going to be the one talking about clean energy. 

Was everyone just in it for the euphoria and trend and got out today? Is everyone anticipating the clean energy spending will go nowhere, similar to how not much happened with Obama's infrastructure plan? 

What caused the drop, was it hedge funds or retail investors bailing?

Such a big decline the day after surely must signal something? 

Should holders of clean energy stocks get out now or ride it out?

Alright, I know there are a lot of skeptics out there on fuel cell. I was one myself for a number of years. Musk even called it ‚Äúfool cell‚Äù. But the truth of the matter is as technology advances, fuel cell has been proven to be more commercially feasible. Fuel cell isn‚Äôt just applied to niche applications anymore and is increasingly adopted in other end-markets (commercial vehicles, aerospace, robotics, etc.). In other words, TAM has become enormous. Fuel cell is argued to to be cleaner and more weight efficient and to provide more range than batteries. I‚Äôm not going to debate on this. In my opinions, both EVs and fuel cell could co-exist in the future given the world‚Äôs accelerated transition to clean energy. 

PLUG‚Äôs two groundbreaking partnerships with SK Group and Renault validated the increased fuel cell adoption around the world and only marked the beginning of the fuel cell era. PLUG already has an established base of blue chip customers such as Amazon, Walmart, DHL, and Home Depot. PLUG‚Äôs partnerships with these customers have continued to expand over time. Interesting fact is that Amazon is not only a key customer but also a shareholder. I expect more partnerships with big names to be under way. Marsh projected revenue to significantly grow to $1.2 billion by 2024 but that could be revised to be more optimistic based on growth. 

In terms of capacity, PLUG is in the process of building out its first gigafactory this year along with 5 hydrogen stations across the country by 2024. PLUG is in a nice position to continue to expand its infrastructure to scale and handle the increased demand. 

In terms of competition, there are no serious competitors that could threaten PLUG in the long run. Unlike EVs, barriers to entry for fuel cell are high due to the capital intensive nature of the business. It took PLUG many years of growing pain, let alone significant capital investments, to get to today‚Äôs position as a clear leader in fuel cell.

In conclusion, I‚Äôve become a firm believer in fuel cell and believe PLUG is ready to capitalize on the rapid growth in fuel cell applications as the next ‚ÄúTesla of fuel cell‚Äù._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Philosophy Friday: Fighting FOMO tl;dr takeaways:  

*"Whether or not an investment is a "good investment" or a "bad investment" has nothing at all to do with whether or not you end up turning a profit."*

* Within an hour after selling Bio Nano for a handsome profit this morning at $7.75/share ($0.72 CB), it spiked to $8.75 and threatened to break $9. I missed out on nearly $1,400 by selling 98 minutes too soon. 
* MSFT, which has reliably doubled every two years since Lincoln was in office, picked the exact time I bought it last year to finally break that pattern and start trading sideways for six months. 
* A friend IRL told me in Nov 2019 that he was YOLO'ing into NIO with $35K, at less than $2/share, but I didn't get in until $21, after he had already cashed out and written a check to buy his new, giant house. 

We all have similar stories, and as long as we invest, we'll keep piling them up. My secret to not having any FOMO or regrets is a concept that's important enough, I think it's fair to call it the investing secret of life:

*Whether or not an investment is a "good investment" or a "bad investment" has nothing at all to do with whether or not you end up turning a profit.* <-- Re-read that sentence.

A good investment is one that helps your personal portfolio align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time line. (This includes another key lesson - when setting goals, "make money" is not a valid goal, because it's not specific, measurable, or attached to a timeframe.) If an investment is truly good and it properly fits your strategy, you'll never have to sweat over whether or not it's time to sell GME, and the bad week ICLN\* and AMD just had wouldn't stress you out. 

*Spend some time this long weekend consciously and deliberately assigning a date and a dollar value to your investment goals. Write it down.* What kind of strategy will it take to get there? What kind of risk will it involve? If the worst feasible and realistic outcome happens, where will that leave you? With markets closed, look at your portfolio. How much do you know about the companies you hold? Are you being honest with yourself about the risk level you've taken on and what you're comfortable with?

For instance, if I have a 50 k account and take 10k in margin will I be fairly safe to avoid margin calls.

What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!**

**\~Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what‚Äôs the upside for the company! So, let‚Äôs go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

So, let‚Äôs start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it‚Äôs one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued & underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don‚Äôt have the growth across all the board like Amazon.

Maybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn‚Äôt helped Amazon since September.

On a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.

E-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&M retailers.

I think one of the biggest problems the company has, it‚Äôs the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn‚Äôt done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.

So, let‚Äôs go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.

The net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.

This year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small & medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.

Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.

We also saw Amazon‚Äôs more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.

The company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more & more AI Improvements.

Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS & Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.

I like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable & cheap internet access around the world.

And last but not least, let‚Äôs not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments & Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising & payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.

Overall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don‚Äôt be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on‚Ä¶

Firstly, let‚Äôs start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.

The company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the last quarter‚Äôs results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon‚Äôs net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.

For the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.

For the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.

Meanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don‚Äôt even matter.

Amazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.

And one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.

So, let‚Äôs start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/89jHggN), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I used the trailing Twelve-month EBITA (which means Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization) and assumed a growth starting from of 15% in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10% growth for EBITA in 2025. EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10% so it keeps the pace with the EBITA. I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18%, which is 2% above the last 4 years avg. NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways, the simpler method is current assets ‚Äì current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash & cash equivalents, market investments, trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable, so this is the formula I used for this DCF. I also implied the same 10% growth for this, as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate. And last but not least I implied a 10% growth for Capital Expenditure as well, which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method, which will show close results to growth approach.

So, this means we have an estimated $584B worth of FCF for a 10% discount rate, which I believe can be even lower for Amazon, but just to be conservative let‚Äôs use this 10% rate for the next 5 years. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over $3T by 2025, which is mind blowing. So, let‚Äôs do the math, with an estimated diluted share count of 531M, that would mean a stock price of $5732 and would imply a return of 83% by 2025. This are insanely huge numbers so let‚Äôs take a look at the EBITDA approach also. The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25, so, with this multiple, the company would only be worth $3200, that would be only a 2.6% gain from where it is now. If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be $4470, with an average return of 43%, which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth. You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company, for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently, so if you use a 50x [multiple](https://ibb.co/VWDxGcg), the actual projections of the stock would be very close, with 71% return for the EBITDA approach and a 77% upside on average, but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach, which is not the DCF method.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let‚Äôs take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.

I implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it‚Äôs likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more & more money.

We also have to estimated what the Capex & Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&D & SG&A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.

[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let‚Äôs assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.

As I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.

For the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.

So, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it‚Äôs trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.

[Compare](https://ibb.co/ChhMP6Z) this to the [DCF](https://ibb.co/1TM7FWd) valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio, while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio, which I don‚Äôt expect Amazon to trade at, not even in 5 years.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets‚Ä¶ I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company‚Ä¶ but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers‚Ä¶ I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy‚Ä¶ but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.

So yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE‚Äôs with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?

The company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.

And let‚Äôs also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?

Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn‚Äôt overbought and hasn‚Äôt been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it‚Äôs very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.

And let‚Äôs take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn‚Äôt that out of possibilities even as Wall Street‚Äôs analysts expect

So, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced by the end of January.

And I shouldn‚Äôt forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.

So, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)

EVBOX is growing 79% yoy with 37% profit margin and estimated to breakeven at 2023 while Chargepoint is growing 60% yoy with 36% profit margin and estimated to breakeven at 2024.

The energy management software is able to perform load shifting, peak shaving, demand response and electricity trading. The software to hardware integration with the diagnostic capability from the consumer side to the business side is something that chargepoint doesn't offer and could easily become the reason to go with EVBox rather than Chargepoint.

Long time lurker here, and I started to delve into the stock market early last year. I have done a considerable amount of research and decided that a long term dividend reinvestment portfolio would be my style. I'm not a massive risk taker, and playing the highs and lows of the market is not something I want to do right now nor have the time to do. Maybe in the future. As I said, I spent a lot of time researching and building a portfolio that I think is well diversified (haven't bought into every position yet, but we're getting there). I included some of the typical mainstays like HD, JNJ, KO, MMM, T etc. 

My question - or rather just looking for thoughts / ideas / experiences is building this portfolio through some of the more risky(?) stocks, like GAIN, ARCC and T. Since these stocks are cheaper and pay out more (as %) I can help build the account value a little quicker to get some of the dividend aristocrat stocks such as MMM, KO, JNJ, MCD etc. Just curious as to the thoughts on this, and yes I'm well aware you're all internet strangers, I shouldn't listen yada yada. I'm well aware, but using this platform to get ideas / thoughts / reasons is just another tool in helping anyone become a more well rounded investor, which is why I am here asking. 

Bonus part 2, if anyone feels like answering: I have included no ETF's into my portfolio at this time. I have not delved deeply into researching them but I get that they can offer quick diversification at a slight expense. I may add something like an SPYD (or another ETF that allows me cheap access to APPL, MSFT etc.) to the portfolio in the future just for the further diversification. Are these worth getting into for a long term dividend paying portfolio?

I have a TD Ameritrade account, and I've been slowly saving and investing and growing my positions over the last 10 years or so. It's a cash account. No margin, no options, no forex. Nothing fancy. I've ALWAYS been a buy and hold style investor.

This week I decided to try out thinkorswim. And I  realized the potential of looking at the charts, monitoring the hot stocks, buying and selling for a quick profit. With the extra cash I've had in my account (accumulation of dividends), I decided to give it a whirl.

Each day I've bought a stock (they were all different stocks), and sold it the same day for a small profit. I have now made $250 this week doing that. I never used all the cash I had available, so I had enough buying power to cover all the purchases (obviously, they wouldn't have let me buy it if I didn't). And then within a day or two I see that the funds settle and are available again in my buying power.

Is this ok to do in this type of account? Are there any ramifications for doing this as long as I always have the buying power to do it? Or at some point will I be "flagged" and suspended. I've read up a bit on pattern day trading, but for some reason I can't make heads or tails of if what I'm doing is considered that. It seems to only apply to margin accounts.

Some other things I'd just like to mention. I'm not taking this lightly, I'm not thinking I'm some invincible trader now that I've made a small amount of money.

A regular stock's price is determined by the order book which is simply a list of prices that users have announced at which they are willing to buy or sell. With a sell, the price goes down, with a buy, the price goes up. The price only changes when someone comes along that is willing to buy/sell at a price in the order book. Correct me if I'm wrong here.

An ETF's price is supposed to change at the same rate as the underlying index (eg S&P500). When people trade one of the actual stocks of the S&P500, that causes the share price of the ETF to change. However, while the exchange is open, that ETF also has an order book and the price changes just like it does with individual stocks.

What I don't understand is how an ETF can follow the index and still have an order book. I have read that the net asset value (NAV) represents the value of the ETF based on the index and that it can deviate from that due to the order book but how come it generally progresses alongside the underlying index? Surely there are days when the stocks of the index closed higher but the ETF closed lower.

Is it reset to the NAV in some way while the exchange is closed?

1 with Edward Jones that has close to 100k and is managed by my guy Rob.

2 with Fidelity that is set up through my company in which they match up to 3%. Most of the stocks are solid bigger companies. (apple, tesla, PayPal, nautilus, and 2 different ETF's). This account is sitting around 20k and I am far less active on it. 

The last account is one I personally set up through SoFi.
I created this investment account so that I could personally play around with different stocks and get a feel for how the market works.

I've currently invested about 5k with close to 1.8k in returns.

With my SoFi account, I will buy a stock for a few hundred bones, and if it goes up in a week or 2 or 3 I'll keep tabs on it. Once it starts to go back down I'll quickly dump all of it to keep my gains. For example, last week I bought about 300 shares of FTFT @about 3.75 per, the next day it went all the way to 10.00 then started to go back down. I sold 150 shares at about 8.75 or so to keep about 1.2k or so. On the flip side I bough about 1000 shares of HIBS (inverse stock) at 2.11 and its done gone down to like .65 and then reverse split. I've had it for months trying to get a profit back. 

I've been doing this with dozens of different stocks. Some big companies, some small penny stocks, and even some mutual funds. I haven't been too close to day trading (buying and selling in the same day over a 4 day period)

But I am curious if this is a good strategy or if I really just need to ride it out? I enjoy checking my sofi account daily and making moves when I see changes....

Amazon.com Inc. is opening warehouses and shipping hubs in the U.S. at the rate of about one every 24 hours. The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride‚Äîand eventually a drone flight‚Äîaway from customers‚Äô homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.

The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who‚Äôd rather see the company focus on profitability.

Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer‚Äôs doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country.

I'm back from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/) 2 months ago! I hope you all are still holding on to PLTR and NIO! I definitely still am. These two are definitely great companies and have much much more room to grow in the future.

I told people following me about DTIL in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/kotsumu/comments/kv5sj1/interesting_tech_worth_keeping_an_eye_on_dtil/) earlier this week and mentioned that I will post it for all sometime soon. I thought to post this on Monday next week, but I couldn't hold in the excitement anymore.

Let's get down to business! CRISPR, if you do not have much background, is a method patented by University of California, Berkley to use an enzyme called Cas9 and a RNA strand to modify the genetic information of organisms. I'm not going to go into detail about how it all works and r/stocks doesn't allow video links, so go to my earlier post this week to see the links to some juicy CRISPR information.

I've been following CRISPR technology for a couple years. However, the timing never felt quite right. Early last year, I was actually looking at EDIT (Editas) but after sorting through some of my thoughts and their documents, I decided not to invest. I really wanted to get into CRISPR but I always had a bias against pharmaceutical companies because of its volatile nature and dependency on drug clearances. There are other reasons but in the end, I decided not to invest and missed out on some big gains It's fine though, I make it a point to look back at opportunities missed once to learn from it and never look back again. There are way too many opportunities out there to waste time regretting. Since I didn't have a good target back then, I just threw some allocated funds into ARKG and called it a day.

You might be wondering why I'm talking about CRISPR when Precision Bioscience doesn't do anything related to CRISPR. It might be evident to you that the CRISPR space is bubbly right now. With CRSP and EDIT at all time highs, it might not be wise to jump in. Luckily for us, Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, free of patents and licenses, that allows gene editing called ARCUS. There are not much information out there publicly due to the proprietary nature of the tech, but the idea seems similar. It uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. The end result is the same, we are still investing in the future of gene editing, we also break free from the licensing restrictions that lock CRSP technology in pharmaceuticals. Yes, that's right, CRISPR doesn't need to only be used in therapeutics, think about what it can do for agriculture and the environment.

In summary here are the precise reasons why I'm starting a small position in Precision Biosciences (pun intended)

* CRISPR is a great new tech but most companies are in the pharmaceutical space
* CRISPR patent woes may slow down innovation
* ARCUS is proprietary and free of licensing constraints to explore the applications of gene editing and its benefits
* I have no way of validating it, but ARCUS is marketed as a less error prone CRISPR. Resulting in more precise genetic modifications.
* With all that said, I believe heavily that gene editing has huge applications in the future not limited to medicine, but in agriculture and the environment as well. Think higher yield, less maintained crops, livestock. Plants/bacteria/organisms that are engineered to solve some environment issues like plastic waste, CO2, or climate change.
* Precision Biosciences does dabble in both medical applications and food via its subsidiary, Elo Life Systems
* CRISPR companies are relatively richly valued (CRSP at 14.5B market cap, EDIT at 5B) whereas DTIL is only valued at 550M indicating that there is a lot of room to grow
* The size of their contracts are smaller, but they do have some recent strategic partnerships with high profile companies like Eli Lilly

With all that said, DTIL seems to be higher risk than some of the other companies that I've posted about previously. They have some cash on hand, albeit not much. It is still enough to give them runway till 2022 where I envision they will need to raise cash again. I plan to be a little bit more conservative with DTIL due to the nature of bio tech companies being volatile. I'll increase my position as I see fit.

Researching on the company, much of its technology may be too expensive and early for current times which begs the question whether or not it would be a good investment for the next few years.

KWS is a UK-based outsourcing video games company with studios across the globe. Their goal is to become 'the go-to provider of video games services'. If you've ever played a game and seen the long list of credits from all the different studios that work on a game, many are outsourcing studios, hired to assist with production.

Right now video game outsourcing is very fragmented. You have small studios here and there doing work, but let's say that you need help with artwork, voice acting and quality assurance, you'd need to hire three different studios to do all that work, which takes time and effort. KWS want to be a provider of every kind of service. If I need artwork, voice acting and QA, I go directly to KWS as a single company, and they set me up with studios that they own all across the globe.

The video gaming industry is expected to grow to $300 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 13%. As the industry grows and games get larger and more ambitious, it becomes impossible for these single studios to handle the workload. Just take a look at the recent Cyberpunk 2077 with all the time it had for development, and see how bugs and glitches defined its release. When games get more ambitious, more help is needed. The outsourcing industry will grow right behind the gaming industry. Even movies require loads of different studios working together to produce the final product. Gaming is moving in this direction as we speak.

'But why not invest in TakeTwo or EA? Don't they make a lot more?' - Absolutely, but it's a lot riskier. Imagine being a CDPR investor and watching your stonks turn to dust because of one bad release? Gaming companies are unpredictable. Keywords avoid this uncertainty by signing contracts that guarantee them money based on the time and resources that go into helping out. They don't see any money that comes from the actual sales of the games. This means that if a game does incredibly well and racks in millions from microtransactions, Keywords don't see a dime from that extra cash. But if the game absolutely blows and nobody buys it, Keywords aren't burned as they still get paid for helping make the game. It's the safe bet if you want exposure to the gaming industry without getting your hands dirty.

**THE DETAILS**

Since 2013, Keywords have been acquiring studios left and right to grow their family and they recently made one of their biggest acquisitions, High Voltage Studios, for $50 million! High Voltage were the studio helping pump out content for Fortnite. These guys were entertaining your younger siblings and you probably had no idea. In 2020 alone they acquired 7 studios and they have no plans on slowing down. Covid has hit some of these independent studios hard and this is where KWS come in and swoops them up. 

By far the two biggest sectors for Keywords are Game Development and Functionality QA, making up 22% and 21% of revenue respectively in H1 2020. Game development grew a staggering 25.7% organically in H1 2020 despite all the challenges with the pandemic. Now it is fair to say that the game development sector is one that KWS have recently entered into, only taking the dive in 2017. However, generating ‚Ç¨38.7 million of revenue in H1 2020 after only 3 years is quite impressive and this is before some of the big acquisitions they made at the end of the year. 

In total for H1 2020 they made ‚Ç¨173.5m representing a YoY growth of 13%. Their EBITDA was ‚Ç¨30.8m, growing 19.3% YoY. Not only are they making more more revenue but they are becoming more profitable in the process. They also reinvested in their current studios back in 2019 with more workstations and equipment. They expected to reap the benefits of this in 2020 but that's been delayed into 2021 so this will be a big year for them.

Keywords aren't a new company. They IPO'd in 2013 and since formed excellent relationships with the biggest gaming companies in the world. They've worked with the likes of EA, Disney, Blizzard etc. I mentioned earlier that they want to be the 'go-to provider' and they are already proving this in the numbers. In the whole of 2019 they had 108 clients using 3 or more of their services. In H1 2020 alone they already have 124 clients using 3 or more of their services. These clients love the convenience of going to one company for all their outsourcing needs.

Rumours are going around that Keywords could be looking into movies and TV but that's a tough industry to break into and they've found a great niche already. But more movies and shows are using Unreal Engine and other game-related tools for production, so it isn't a far-fetched idea.

H2 2020 is going to be massive, with the effects of their acquisitions being felt. I'm expecting huge earnings.

**COMPETITION**

As I said before, the outsourcing industry is very fragmented so the studios you'll find directly competing with Keywords are small and often only provide one or two services. The only noteworthy competitor I've seen is Virtuos Studios, although they are much younger than Keywords, much smaller in terms of workforce, only provide two services, and aren't publicly traded.

**STOCK ACTION**

Keywords had a huge run up in 2020, up over 70% since the dip in March. This was due in part to institutions upgrading it to a BUY. Barclays was one of the big ones to upgrade, stating 'Keywords Studios offers low risk video games exposure' and setting a price target of ¬£29.50. Since the run up, Berenberg have downgraded Keywords from a BUY to a HOLD but still raised their price target to ¬£28.90 from ¬£25.10, basically stating that they were worried that accelerated growth will place pressure on margin (how stupid). So the stock has been dipping since then and is down nearly 10% this week.

If you're looking for a good entry point, you won't find a better one.

**FINAL VERDICT**

2021 is KWS' year and I won't be surprised if it's worth ¬£4-5 billion by the end of the year

**TL;DR:** KWS offers low risk exposure to games industry. They have basically no competition and are becoming big. The stock has dipped so this is a good entry point.

When a company / stock has it‚Äôs warrants called, how will I find out?  Will my broker (Merrill Edge) in my case, notify me via a message or alert that I have 30 days to either sell or exercise my warrants before they become .01?  From what I understand this happens two ways.  Either the expiration date for the warrants has come OR once the warrant trades for 20 trading days at an average price of $18 or higher within a 30 day period.  

The second scenario has me stressed, not knowing how or if I will be notified if the warrants are called due to the price being over $18 for a period of time.  

The reason I buy warrants is so that I can have the chance to buy more shares up front at the guaranteed price in companies that I plan on holding long term in hopes of having more money in the future to pay for the cost of exercising the warrants at a later date.  I‚Äôm aware that Merrill Edge charges $30 to exercise a group of warrants each time.

Hello r/stocks! I'm trying to understand the wash rule scenario and through my readings I havent come across my scenario just yet. I would appreciate any info you can provide, I'm just trying to understand what I may be expected to pay in taxes in April.

Like many I have been day trading stocks during remote work with some degrees of success. I actively traded SQ during the year leading to a significant amount of wash sale. I have also traded SQ in 2021, which I understand resets the wash sale timer and has me extremely concerned about my taxes for 2020. My account shows I have 25k in short term gains, -248k in short term loss, and 231k in short-term disallowed loss. My netgain/loss is about $8200 for the year. Since I have traded SQ in 2021 I want to understand how that impacts my taxes going forward.

I'm hoping to clear up 2 things:

1 Wash sales impact your ability to deduct investment income against ordinary income, usually capped at 3k. By Rolling the wash sale into 2021 have I effectively lost the ability to deduct 3k in losses?

2 What will I actually be taxed on in 2020? 25k in short term gains - (-248k short term loss+227 disallowed loss)? Or my net gain/loss of 8200 for the year? Do I ignore the disallowed loss on my tax form and take the net sum of short term gain/loss?

Lastly, did I completely misunderstand this rule? I feel like I might get hit with a massive tax bill because of my lack of understanding on the subject

CINEWORLD GROUP-2%_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA and TLRY merger arbitrage opportunity? I'm not sure if the word 'arbitrage' applies here, but hopefully you get my gist.

APHA and TLRY will merge in Q2. Shareholders will receive \~ .84 shares of TLRY for every share of APHA they hold. If the price ratios of APHA:TLRY is less than .84:1 doesn't this mean purchasing and holding APHA through the share conversion will earn money?

The current ratio of APHA to TLRY at time of writing this is approx .65. At the time of writing this (7am Jan 15), that means APHA shares would have to increase by 23% in order to equal the value they will gain in the merger!

There's 3 reasons I can see for this happening:

1) I am wrong

2) The current ratio is a result of applying the risk that the price of TLRY will decrease faster than APHA or the merger will somehow fall through

3) There is an actual imbalance in the stock prices due to investor sentiment.

Which one of these is correct? And if it's #1, please enlighten me before I convert all my TLRY shares to APHA._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba (BABA) to continue its rally. It is 2% up premarket üöÄ The closer to having Trump out of the picture, the faster BABA is rebounding back to its real value.

I feel as though a lot of those commenters are people that haven‚Äôt spent much, or any, time actively trading; or else have invested decent capital into stocks and just seen ‚Äònumber go up‚Äô. 

It is the goal of every trader to become consistently profitable. That means constructing a system with good risk management based on sound technical analysis and the discipline to stick to it. For those unaware, it seems that guy lost $850 dollars quite quickly and then made $1050 dollars over some months to put him 100 in the green overall. If he has truly found a system that can make him net profit over time, ie his gains exceed his losses each month, then obviously his position size will increase (while keeping risk the same) and he‚Äôll be onto big things in short order. 

In fact, the likelihood is that he still hasn‚Äôt actually found a consistently profitable system (given he‚Äôs only been trading for 8 months!) and it will take some more losses and experimenting before he does. In short, if he has a consistently profitable system after 8 months, he‚Äôs something of an outlier. Peter L Brandt recently remarked that becoming a successful trader takes around 3-4 years generally, and that if you do it in 1 you‚Äôre way ahead of the curve. 

If you decide to learn to trade that means you are most likely forfeiting short-term gains that could be main from passive investment in order to learn that skill. It just irked me to see him being put down and made fun of by people that don‚Äôt seem to understand these basic principles, either because they spot invest over time and make money (a great method, fair play to you) or you think that traders should be consistently profitable straight away (complete nonsense). 

And in fairness, this is r/stocks and so is not geared to active trading (i don‚Äôt think?), so his post may have been a little out of place. Annoying how he got put down by people who obviously didn‚Äôt understand what he was trying to achieve (and so far has done a good job of)‚Äîlearning to actively trade and be consistently profitable.


**Edit** - I‚Äôm getting the feel of the sub, and it seems like his post was misplaced. Fair enough. But you guys are profitable investors right? All in the green? So why not calmly tell him and anyone else that posts about trading that this isn‚Äôt really the sub for that, and you guys are all about passive investing? Certainly, telling someone that going from $150 to $1100 (almost 10x) in a few months is a shit trader, when you yourself have never traded, is kinda barmy. The sub comes across as a bit of a dogmatic rabble, and I‚Äôm a bit taken aback by the hostility._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lithium and Nickel investing might switch around to Sodium Sulfur and can be a potential hit for long term investors.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --¬†The global [sodium sulfur battery market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/sodium-sulfur-batteries-market/?utm_source=prnewswire&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=cmfe_1-dec-20&utm_term=sodium-sulfur-batteries-market&utm_content=rd)¬†size is **expected to reach** **USD 480.4 million** **by 2027**, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., **expanding at a CAGR of 29.6% from 2020 to¬†2027**. The growing demand for energy storage batteries and power supply across the globe is expected to boost the growth of the market over the estimated period.

**Key suggestions from the report:**

* **The industrial product segment was valued at** **USD 49.23 million** **in 2019**

Sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries are pre-eminent by adding electrodes to increase their operational flexibility and lifespan. It also eliminates the hazards related to fire calamities. However, sodium sulfur batteries are hazardous and can catch fire easily when they meet moisture and air. Due to the highly corrosive nature, along with the high operating temperature of sodium polysulfide, these batteries are used in stationary applications, including grid energy storage.

The renewable energy stabilization application segment is projected to witness substantial growth over the upcoming years as NaS batteries are a possible energy storage technology to support renewable energy power generation, precisely solar and wind generation plants. Moreover, the growing integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, into the grid areas is projected to boost the growth of the renewable energy stabilization application segment. The industrial product segment accounted for 81.8% share of the global revenue in 2019. Growing energy requirements have resulted in an improved usage of storage batteries used in off-grid locations, which has directly impacted the demand for NaS batteries.

The Asia Pacific held a leading share in the global market in 2019. The growth of the market is ascribed to the growing demand for renewable energy storage units across the commercial and industrial sectors. Moreover, in 2019, Asia Pacific accounted for over 47% of the global investments in renewable sources of energy. The growing investments across the region are driven by the government authorities in the countries that are putting more effort to surge renewable sources of energy. The presence of many manufacturers in Japan and South Korea is also likely to support regional market growth. Moreover, potential industries across India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore are likely to create high demand for such batteries in the upcoming years.

Semiconductors blew up last year, and Marvell certainly benefitted from that. Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. 

broadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Why it might be a good play:** HYMC has been in development of new mining sites and the infrastructure around them. Due to COVID there were setbacks with construction and implementation. Their new target date is in **Q1.** They have also **HIRED a new COO with years of experience in actual mining (** [Hycroft Appoints Jack Henris As Chief Operating Officer And Fortifies Operating And Technical Teams With Several Key Additions | Markets Insider (usinessinsider.com)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hycroft-appoints-jack-henris-as-chief-operating-officer-and-fortifies-operating-and-technical-teams-with-several-key-additions-1029959304) ) With Biden potentially pumping BILLIONS of dollars out, gold and silver are safe plays.

 They basically have brought in a guy with 35+ years of experience actually implementing the mining process, which is what the company is looking to do over the next few months. I don't think this company is very good at being a finical institution, but it can deliver on its mining goals, which is all we need it to do.

**Where does it stand on its value:** Currently this stock is reviewed as **UNDERVALUED at 7.30** analysts believe **TP IS $15+** [HYMC Stock Forecast, Price & News (Hycroft Mining) (marketbeat.com)](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/HYMC/) Some websites have valued it at 300% less than its value, but those are insane to me.

**Insider trading?** One large hedge fund dumped about 1million in shares over the last 6months. Scary right? Thats about 115,000 shares they dumped. Not really because that same company **still holds 11,953,217 shares.** They also dumped the shares at $8. This did cause a dip, but guess what the stock bounced RIGHT FUCKING BACK. The CFO and CEO both bought shares in December. $150,000 at $7 a share. That to me says they have confidence in the moves they are making for q1, and are more than comfortable with the $7 base price, which guess what, the stock is currently above. That to me makes this a VERY safe stock to invest in because the implied value is basically where we are starting at.

**$BURL** \- Same play as $BILL. Bouncing off the 50EMA, channel, and support -- but it looks like it is possibly tired. RSI and Vortex fair, but Stoch is low which is great.

**$CLNE** \- Pull back here, or closer to end near $9. I am not convinced either way but a great set up. Bouncing off 50EMA lovely, support close by. All indicators are fair

**$EGP** \- Gorgeous channel up. Holding support at the POC and just tapped in channel. Indicators are fair, but that makes sensE being in the middle of an ascension.

**$EVBG** \- Channel up that just hit resistance, it is gonna break through? It has 50EMA, support, and channel support. RSI fair, but Stoch low, Vortex consolidating; good setup.

**$KTRA** \- BE careful. Just tapped support today and took off. Might have more in the tank; if not watchlist for later and buy in $1.30 Indicators say it has room to still room!

**$MSFT** \- Obvious Blue-chip; but excellent deal. Ascending Triangle, at support, and channel -- love it. RSI is oversold-ish, Stoch and Vortex low, reversal coming.

**$NOW** \- Beautiful channel up testing 200EMA, channel, and support. Great setup. All indicators fair but that makes sense at this price and channel action.

**$RVP** \- JUST dropped off a cliff, after we made money 3 days ago! Channel, 200EMA, and support here, easy setup. RSI fair, but Stoch is low, so I like it a lot.

Nikola now partnered to provided hydrogen to Arizona reminds me another company, Tesla. Iconic Tesla giving crazy growth throughout 2020 making a lot of Tesla investors millionaires. Tesla vehicles as we all know was started as a proof of concept for the battery tech and Elon's ultimate goal for the electrical energy world, the cars just happened to fulfill a solution to a less pollutant future due to car emissions. Nikola seems to be mimicking that idea just with hydrogen, gas energy, think of it as your 2 providers for your home Tesla "Electric Company Nikola "Gas Company." Nikolas new partner ship will allow Nikola to provided Arizona with hydrogen stations then hopefully move toward providing North America with stations. New deals with electrical and water providers at there new plant will most surely speed this process up as water and electricity are the main components in creating hydrogen. Nikola last earnings had about 900 million cash on hand. Evidently the new plant in Arizona along with trying to accomplish producing the Tre truck, New hires, will eat up a huge amount of this cash on hand. But if Nikola can accomplish Arizona successfully along with production this stock will surely pop. It could possibly be the mini Tesla of the hydrogen world being a provider of hydrogen gas and a manufacture for hydrogen vehicles. Majority of the new Ev company's and this "Ev Wave" seem more focused on the car itself and not the infrastructure behind them. Nikola plant being located near I10 could most likely also act as Nikolas first fueling station truck stop. Evidently I see growth to come for this stock as year continues. Surely Tesla will always be favored due to "automatous driving" and the techy features associated with there electric vehicle's and Tesla's simply the "OG" of the Ev world._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you think of this reasoning for gold to be worth $2,260 an ounce?

What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone here buy and hold the most hyped stocks on Reddit from 3-5 years ago? How has that turned out? So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.

So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs (weighted to ARKG). I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.

I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.

Has anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up. But I can't really tell because I'm only looking at what was most upvoted and using search terms like "what are your top picks for the long term"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NEXT BIG STOCK !!!

Been a lurker for a few months and have been slowly learning and earning. This week I made my first $400 having around $2800 in the past 4 months. I'm getting very busy at work and would like to keep investing passively. I have a handful of etf's and companies I am comfortable with in the long run but am having a hard time deciding how much of what I put in should goto each stock. 

A common answer I see is to save first before invest, and my short answer is that I am. I am treating investing as a "side-hustle" if you will and am simply looking into growing some of my paycheck.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Compound growth calculation for investments Hello investors! 

Recently I‚Äôve become more interested in investing and strategies to better manage my money and currently I‚Äôm interested in idea of investing some of my savings in an ETF. I want to do this to achieve annual growth of roughly 10% in a long term, which is, as far as I‚Äôve read, the average for ETFs annual growth rate. My intention was to reinvest the dividends and invest an additional 300‚Ç¨ from my salary each month. I‚Äôm interested in the results for 5-10 year period. To be more precise, I want to know how much growth could I expect if I invested for example 10k dollars after all the taxes are deducted.

I have tried to calculate this by hand, but it‚Äôs a bit tricky to calculate it exactly since the sum that is reinvested from dividends would grow along with my position growth.

Just want someone with experience in investing to confirm if my thinking here is all right, or am I missing something? (I am new to this)

Also I wonder if there is some kind of compound growth calculator that is specifically designed for this case?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does anyone know anything about Scynexis (SCYX)?
