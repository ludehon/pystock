As you may have heard from WSB, your main source for stonk news, Steel Gang is rising up.

Steel demand will be coming next year. I've seen many people doing DD on steel and MT in particular, so, if anything, this is simply more confirmation bias. 

MT is perfect because they encompass 6% of the steel market.

COVID has slowed iron ore mining in 2020, the key ingredient for steel. Now that a vaccine has arrived, COVID will start to die down, auto manufacturers and builders will be ramping up again, people are going back to work, Tesla is building Cybertruck, STEEL is going to make a comeback in a big way. Expect little to no price action until about mid-January. 

Have a look at the forecast for 2021 below:

Demand is set for 2021 to be not only higher than 2020, but higher than 2019.

$MT also hit a 52 week high today probably due to retards buying it first thing this morning (like myself)

Edit. üöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Coinbase files for IPO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looming Crash or Face-Melting Rally? Take a look at the [Dark Index](https://imgur.com/a/f8jdfT1) right now. GEX just spiked to an all time high last night. And what does this mean? It refers to a market-makers‚Äô obligation to hedge. Basically, a drop is on the horizon. Often, the drop happens within a day or 2 of the spike. Therefore, we should know by Monday whether we‚Äôre dropping.

BUT, there‚Äôs more. The drop doesn‚Äôt have to happen shortly. If we look back at August 18th, the GEX spiked again. After, we saw an insane rally to new highs for the rest of the month before the inevitable drop. 

One key difference? A common guess is SoftBank helped to push this rise. Also, there was a purchase of [$35M worth of Call Options](https://imgur.com/a/pzcLfgK) on $SPY the day after GEX spiked, which is is pretty bullish for a supposed top they were buying at. Perhaps they knew something? 

To my knowledge, I haven‚Äôt seen anything of that magnitude today, so I‚Äôm hedging in the downward for now. If I don‚Äôt see anything in the next 2 trading days, I‚Äôm as bullish as can be until January.

Another thing to point out is the DIX spiked shortly ago, which indicates a rally. I‚Äôm betting against this one though for now.

Currently, looking at $VXX $23C 12/23/2020. If the drop happens, expect VXX to top out around $24 based on a 12% drop from the last peak. $SPY and $QQQ puts are also acceptable. 

TLDR: Friday/Monday will be a key decider in if we start a massive rally or crash and burn. If it helps, I was bullish as fuck for December, and expected a crash in early January. So my instincts say stay long, but sometimes I just enjoy being a üåà üêª

A lot of things happened since then, including me getting stuck in the hospital for 2 months, but a promise is a promise. Besides, I figured WSB only pays attention to the stocks, which already moved up significantly in the past few days, before falling off the cliff once we, retards, load up on calls. And as you‚Äôve probably seen, silver has moved up \~8% in a few days (miners ‚Äì 15% and more). So here we go.

This post is designed to give a start to those of you, who know nothing about this field and just want to dip their toes. In no way, shape or form I poses professional knowledge or formal education on mining, this is purely what I‚Äôve learned speculating stocks.

**1. Why invest in silver miners?**

I‚Äôll give you 5 reasons:

1. Silver is a stronger (but riskier) hedge against monetary inflation: if you are right about inflation gold will move, but silver will move more;
2. Silver has much more industrial usage than gold;
3. Jewelers have bigger demand for silver than gold;
4. Silver to gold price ratio is historically low right now and all commodities are undepriced compared to equity futures like S&P.
5. Silver is future-proof, unlike gold: it is heavily used in solar panels and electronics. Also, 2019 industrial and jewelry demand of silver is very suppressed: only jewelry silver demand is estimated to lose 23% in 2020.

In fact, let‚Äôs talk about demand:

As of 2018, total demand was 32 146 tons of physical silver:

https://preview.redd.it/ce1b3cfs2t561.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=623d38466713f2d66beaa7ed251225dc00556930

Industrial use: 17997 tons (\~ 56%);

Jewelry: 6611 tons (\~ 21%);

Coins and bars: 5637 tons (\~ 18%);

Silverware: 1900 tons (\~ 6%).

Among industrial demand electronics contributes 7730 tons, while solar was already 2503 tons in 2018. This will only increase. Yep, you‚Äôve probably thought that majority of silver is used on silver spoons that your grandma used to pick up in Target, while cool futuristic kids use lithium in Tesla‚Äôs. Turns out, solar panels already use more silver than all of the silverware combined.

There‚Äôs also another reason to play silver miners right now: it was harder hit by Covid lockdowns. Why so? Because majority of silver production is done in Latin America (in fact, out of 6 biggest producing countries ‚Äì 4 are in Latin America) and Latin countries on average had much tougher lockdowns, compared to leading gold producers like Australia, China, Russia, etc.

**2. How silver is mined?**

Unlike some other metals, silver is never found on itself. It is always mined in ores that contain either of three large groups of metals: gold, copper, zinc and lead. Ore is then processed and refined to get the end product. Why is this important? Because when you build a model trying to forecast earnings of the company you can not focus on silver prices alone, you have to take every byproduct into consideration.

**3. How to determine which mine is a good buy?**

**3.1. Let‚Äôs start by understanding metrics.** Your regular EBITDA, EPS or even FCF won‚Äôt tell you much about where the miner is going, because

a) they do not determine the price of their product;b) they have no direct control over the longevity of the product source.

That‚Äôs why gold miners came out with their unique metrics by which they evaluate each individual mine and then calculate producer‚Äôs average. Those metrics are Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Costs. Those are non-GAAP metrics and I‚Äôm not even sure if they are audited.

Cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital, development and exploration costs. AISC is, basically, a wider metric introduced later by World Gold Council. It includes every cost of running a mine excluding:‚Ä¢ Income tax.‚Ä¢ Working capital (except for adjustments to inventory on a sales basis).‚Ä¢ All financing charges (including capitalized interest).‚Ä¢ Costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions and asset disposals.‚Ä¢ Items needed to normalize earnings, for example impairments on non-current assets and one-time material severance charges.

If you want to learn more about quirks and features of those metrics I urge you to read this paper: [https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine\_engr/9/](https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine_engr/9/)

So take metal futures prices average during quarter, subtract AISC and here goes your mine profit before taxes and royalty payments.

**3.2. Silver miners now also use mostly AISC**. And calculating silver production they use Ag Eq metrics, which is average ratio of silver to all other byproducts over the quarter. And when they present profits, they also use Ag Eq sold, which again include silver and all byproducts.

I would argue, that Ag Eq metrics are also misleading for silver miners. Because when a gold miners produce gold all other byproducts are not that numerous and, what‚Äôs more important, far, far cheaper, thus their impact is negligible. Silver is a different story. For example, let's take Caylloma mine, 2019. They produced 45.6kk lb of Zinc, 28.7kk lb of Lead and 0.9 kk oz of silver. In today prices this would be 58kk USD / 27kk USD and 23.4kk USD. As you can see, in fact silver's output for this mine is the smallest. I've even came across arguments, that silver should never be considered a main product, only a byproduct.

The problem for you is that you might be watching only silver prices, which, say increase 25% and wonder, why your miner isn‚Äôt doing so great, while ignoring that zinc and lead prices dropped and it had a bigger impact on your miner, than rising silver.

What you could use instead is a total cost of tonnes milled. Most miners publish this metric. And then model every metal received separately. In fact, most analysts try to model grades of mines, which is basically amount of useful stuff among all shit excavated. But we‚Äôre getting really too deep now.

**3.3. Another extremely important thing to remember is a life of a mine.** See, it can be very different: some mines can live 20 years, some are ending their life cycle. You open prospects of a miner and you search for the guidance on the next year and you see how much metals they plan to produce. Then you check expected life of their assets. If an asset is nearing it‚Äôs end, grades usually get lower, which means less profits. Also, investors put a pressure on a miner to replace dying asset, and if nothing is found in time ‚Äì stock price tends to trade lower than what it‚Äôs cash flows might suggest.

There are also surprise scenarios like extending the life expectancy of a mine, or finding new deposits. But that‚Äôs a gamble.

Once a mine is done, it becomes a liability, instead of an asset, because it is put on care and maintenance, which is expensive and lasts years and years. That‚Äôs why I prefer junior miners with only few assets: they usually do not baghold liabilities from long-gone projects. And also it‚Äôs easier to model them.

**3.4. Finally, pay attention to jurisdictions**: how stable the local governments are, how corrupt or how focused on ESG standards. Unfortunately, mining is a risky business with bad rep (sometime deserved, sometimes not). That‚Äôs why a populist government can always blame miners on some environmental or social damage and close them down or nationalize the mine.

**Bonus.** Let‚Äôs look into my biggest silver position as of today: Fortuna Silver Mine (**FSM**).

Reasoning:

1. Relatively stable jurisdictions of Mexico, Peru and Argentina;
2. Heavy Covid lockdowns, so I could pick it up rather cheap;
3. Peru and Mexico mines have at least 5 years of life;
4. They have gold mine under construction in Argentina. It is expected to have 15 years of life and to produce 150k oz of gold per year at AISC 800 USD/oz. This is not yet properly priced in, because FSM is trading following mainly silver and silver miners ETFs. This is also in part because the project has been delayed several times. But they‚Äôve already mined first 15k oz this year, so I have little doubt that they will achieve meaningful production next year.
5. Relatively low cost of production;
6. CEO is third generation miner and Peru national;
7. They have increased their debt to finance Argentina project, but the net debt is not that big compared to Free Cash Flow;
8. Sprott fund is heavily into this stock and so is Adrian Day (he has his own fund and also manages Peter Schiff‚Äôs funds while Peter sticks to ranting about the Fed on his radio).

I have a price target of 8.66 for FSM, with a rather conservative metal prices estimate.

**Let‚Äôs sum it all up.**

**Why invest in a silver miner?**

Because silver moves more than gold, because it has much more industrial and practical use and it has future upside.

**How do you find good silver miners?**

You pick stable jurisdictions, you look into byproducts and estimate if those also fit your outlook and price expectancy and, finally, you check the life expectancy of the mines. Of course, do not forget to look into the books and check the debt ratios.

To be fair, I‚Äôll also list considerations **why NOT to invest in a silver miner**:

1. company has almost no control over the price of the product;
2. high political and social risks;
3. uncertainty of the company‚Äôs future once it‚Äôs mines reach their end: there‚Äô no guarantee that the management will be able to find an asset of an equal quality, thus rarely miners are ‚Äòbuy and hold forever‚Äô;
4. no goodwill, brand value or any kind of a moat;
5. mining industry has a bad rep and is often operating in remote areas, thus it‚Äôs very limited in it‚Äôs access to good labour;
6. basically, no meaningful dividend.

Hope this helps someone to make an educated decision or to carry a deeper research. If any of you have questions or would like to discuss commodities ‚Äì I‚Äôll be glad. Also, I might do a write up on commodities that will be used in future green tech (EVs, solar, etc), since there‚Äôs so much more than just lithium.

So I got pretty screwed this morning. I decided to take the 5k I had to go into ARK etfs and try my first day trade. Watched WNW this morning go progressively from 66-120 or so then decided to make a bet too. Put a market order at 10:10am which executed 30 shares @ $154 then I quickly did a 5% stop limit sell at $130-145.

A few minutes go buy, then the stock slips to $144. A bit upset that I probably just sold, I go into the stock to check the order and see it was cancelled. WTF wells fargo, that was strange. I put in another sell on it...BAM cancelled a minute later. Try again then this doozy of an error, "you cannot trade because the stock has been halted". Absolutely gutted. 10 minutes go by no updates. 30 minutes, etc, nothing, no ticks etc.

After a phone call with wellsfargo, they seemed able to put in a stop limit at 130-145....

Then the stocks opens at $88 at 10:57AM (A full 30min+ after the last tick). Ended up selling at $116 just to get out, which is maybe another mistake, just cant get over how everything went down. I had to buy within that exact few mins, have a sell limit auto-cancel prior to fulfillment (it should have triggered!) and then get locked out the minute after.

Anyone else have any similar halt stories? Even if not WNW. Whoever that hedge fund dude was today, he made serious bank off us scrubs. He sold off \~50% of the damn stock in one go. I feel like this is the new "please call about your car renewal" or "a Nigerian prince has money for you" scam, be careful out there of these IPOs the craze is the weakness!

**DISCLAIMER: This is my personal opinion and not professional investment advice.**

Okay retards I've been watching this stock for a few months and I got a banger for us to make some tendies on. So hear me out, it's a clinically proven fact that vaccines are the leading cause of retardation. Just think about it, have you ever gotten a vaccine before (the answer is probably yes)? Now ask yourself, where are you currently? Are you at home, at work, on the porcelain throne? NOPE, you are in the retard capital of the world, r/wallstreetbets. After being a longtime lurker in this subreddit there is one thing that's clear to me, the **RETARDS** make money, and the **CHADS** blow up their accounts. So that is where the basis for this option play comes from.

Vaccine HYPE = Retarded GAINS.

## Karyopharm Therapeutics - Who Are They?

Karyopharm Therapeutics is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies. Their leading therapeutic drug, Xpovio (Selinexor), is a selective inhibitor of nuclear exports. It works by binding to the exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is a eukaryotic protein that mediates the nuclear export of various proteins and RNAs. So in layman's terms this drug works by blocking the transport of cancerous proteins involved in cancer-cell growth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication and is approved for the use in patients with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma [\[1\]](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051422/0/en/Karyopharm-Announces-FDA-Approval-of-XPOVIO-selinexor-for-the-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Relapsed-or-Refractory-Diffuse-Large-B-cell-Lymphoma-DLBCL.html).

# Karyopharm Therapeutics - Why Should I Care?

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is caused by the single stranded RNA virus (SARS-CoV2). A protein called exportin 1 (XPO1) has been shown to be important in both the virus lifecycle and the inflammation caused by the virus. The inhibition of XPO1 by taking Selinexor leads to both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. So while this drug may not be a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù per-se, it has the efficacy of being used for patients with COVID-19 to help relieve symptoms and drastically reduce the chance of the being put on a ventilator due to its anti-inflammatory effects on the lungs alveoli (tiny air sacs that fill with oxygen when you inhale). This is what makes this company so valuable, the fact that they aren't dependent on a hit or miss vaccine, they have a reliable treatment to COVID-19, which is a leading cure for cancer. Karyopharm gets all the hype around vaccines, while maintaining very little of the expectations of putting out a working product (they already have one).

# Pre-Vaccine Outlook

This was my pre-vaccine outlook on this stock. I was hoping it was getting ready to skyrocket, unfortunately it kept its steady decline downwards, hitting resistance in the $14-$15 range. Thank god I was a CHAD at the time and didn't end up investing. However, one thing happened on November 9th that set the events for this stock to skyrocket - VACCINE SZN! So now I'm back and more retarded than ever and willing to bet big on this one.

# Post-Vaccine Outlook

https://preview.redd.it/mh1d2r4bhs561.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b6abd2d961e6bc3a67ff11f7293927e8d6ac80c

I have put together some of the most discussed stocks ‚ÄúVaccine Stocks‚Äù in the last month that I felt were somewhat connected to Karyopharm in that their vaccines/treatments focus on an RNA inhibitor either preventing the spread of the virus or drastically reduce the chance of you getting it all together (basically tricking the body into thinking you already had it). Group 1 Stocks have already popped from their November 9th price point, however, Group 2 Stocks have been lagging behind. **Pfizer (PFE)** being the first big name company to announce and commercialize a vaccine already had this priced into their stock price. Analysts predicted that this vaccine would increase Pfizer's earnings by 10% next year with an expected sale of 1.3 billion doses of their Covid vaccine. **Karyopharm (KPTI)** is in a unique position as it has been vastly overshadowed by the big name companies debuting a vaccine and awaiting FDA approval, while Karyopharm already has an effective treatment that is multifaceted in its use. Once Covid 19 is gone, the treatment can still be heavily commercialized for cancer treatments.

 We all know technicals are bullshit, so ill keep this short. Looking at the technicals I think we are set up to ramp up over the next month back to the \~$17.5 - $20 range. I have purchased both $17.5 1/15 Calls and $20 2/19 Calls. About $10,000 worth combined. 

**TLDR:**

Just buy this shit. Xpovio (Selinexor) link in helping treat COVID-19 and potential vaccine trials brought this company a lot of exposure in Wall Street as well as mainstream media which should bring it short/mid term gains from those trying to profit off this vaccine hype that's driving the market currently.

Buy 1-2 month out OTM calls.

Some bullet points I found on the internets:

Skillz began trading on the NYSE today under the ticker SKLZ.

The SPAC transaction included $849 million in funding from investors like Wellington and Fidelity.

Now that it is trading, Skillz has $250 million in cash.

Additionally, investors will appreciate that it has no debt on its balance sheet.

Importantly, Skillz is now the first publicly traded mobile esports platform.

This public debut sets a record and also comes at a time when esports are increasingly popular.

Company executives think the Skillz SPAC merger is the perfect way to leverage the growth runway in the industry and to expand internationally.

With this in mind, Skillz estimates that there are 2.7 billion gamers in the entire world.

Those 2.7 billion gamers are in a market that will be worth $150 billion by 2025.

Right now, the international market makes up less than 10% of company revenue.

However, Skillz said it has plans to really lean into international expansion.

It believes its own revenue will grow from $225 million in 2020 to $555 million in 2022._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSB OPTIONS ACTIVITY FOR PLTR TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street Bets Popular Ticker Scraper This is just a simple Python script for scraping the most popular tickers on wall street bets.

You retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). 

Gov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. 

Nobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.

Those bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.

The OTC stock is up nearly 40% today on the news, perhaps being taken as a sign of making amends and ending further action from the SEC at least.

PD: used to be a PM at a 5bn fund, but just realised that stonks only go up and quit to trade by myself_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Why you should be playing VALE instead of MT (if you had to choose one) I am seeing way too many people supposedly going all in on MT. Here I will cover my reasons for choosing VALE over MT as my main steel play. Disclaimer: I'm a dumb idiot just like the rest of you, this is not financial advice, and also diversification is always a viable choice. If you want to play both, in addition to CLF or whatever, all the power to you. I personally hold all of these to some degree though mostly in VALE. This post is directed to people who want to slam dunk every dollar into one ticker.

**---VALE has far lower IV than MT. This mean MUCH cheaper options.**

I'm putting this first. I know that IV is a vague, mysterious concept to most of you. In simple terms, IV dictates how expensive options are. VALE calls are ridiculously cheap compared to MT because of its lower IV. Here's an example, using current call prices with June 2021 strike date since this is a popular date.

VALE June 2021 20c (15% OTM): 1.04

MT June 2021 28c (18% OTM): 2.37

These prices are ridiculous. For the price of that one MT call, which has a delta of 0.4, you could buy 2.27 VALE calls, which give a combined delta of .87!

Again to simplify this, your potential profit per dollar invested is more than twice as high with VALE calls! Yes the underlying stock price is a little different, but not nearly enough to compensate for this difference. Unless you think MT will outperform VALE significantly, which for the reasons below is unlikely anyway, you should absolutely be in VALE instead of MT.

**---One major reason for the current steel price spike is high iron ore prices**

https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-prices-on-the-march-again/

>Last week the steelmaking raw material hit $160, the highest since February 2013 and up 70% year to date. 

**---VALE is a major steelmaker and at the same time the world's second biggest iron ore producer**

https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-five-iron-ore-producing-companies-world/

Smell that? That's the smell of VERTICAL INTEGRATION and benefiting at every step of the supply chain. Should note that VALE is usually the biggest iron ore producer, but production has recently fallen due to several factors.

**---MT in comparison only mines 1/6th as much iron ore as VALE**

https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-metals-and-mining-companies-in-2020/

>ArcelorMittal operates 13 mines, which produced 57.1Mt of iron ore during the year accounting for 52% of the company‚Äôs iron ore requirements.

This means MT needs to pay out the ass for the remaining 48% of their iron ore requirements. That means less tendies.

**---VALE also has hidden major potential upsides in its nickel production**

Remember the battery day DDs? They are still relevant. VALE is the world's biggest nickel producer. That's not going away.

https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-nickel-producing-companies/

Oh and nickel prices are spiking as well.

A few of you have shot me DM's on the SLUTZ for UTZ play. As of right now I've closed my Dec 20.00 calls for about 120% gain and I'm holding onto some 22.5's for lottos. The lottos are down about 5K.

I am also up about 30K on my January 20's and 22.50's.

I don't recommend duplicating this play any longer as the upside is more limited. Utz might get the 23/24 but it could take longer than january, and at that price, I believe it is fairly valued.

If you want to play future dates, then sell 22.50 and 20.00 cash secured puts. I am going to sell my 22.50's shortly and let the 20's ride. I am not going to take any more options positions in UTZ.

As stated I don't know much about the stock market itself BUT I can say that I have a pretty sound understanding of the significance of future treatment opportunities (med student, 4th year). Big things are happening in the treatment of all kinds of diseases that until today were not really well treatable. Now a new focus especially is the integration of the Immune system into a medical treatment. The past few years medicine was all about supporting the human body or fixing the human body with the mindset that it can't fix itself. Now immune therapy is on a big rise. Why did this take so long you might ask? Technology. Effective methods are just now beginning to come up and that shit looks promising as fuck. I could go into the details but this is already a huge text so I just make it short: The immune system has been part of us for thousands of years. Surely it will always be vulnerable to NEW infections BUT since new infections were a thing before all along means what developed over all the years was the effectiveness of ADAPTING to a new threat. It truly is astonishing how insanely effective our immune system can create an effective HIGHLY specific response to a new threat. And as I talked about this before, using this very effective system as a way of confronting a disease has not been used at all except for vaccination of course. Because we didn't have a way to to it. Now what BNTX and MRNA are pushing with their vaccine is a technology that is thought of since 1990. So the idea of an mRNA vaccine (earlier even DNA vaccine) already exists quite a while but this technology had the struggles of the mRNA being destroyed in our body before it could fulfill it's purpose. They had to find new ways to modify the mRNA so it could survive long enough to fulfill it's purpose. THAT was the problem. Now this year they really seemed to be able to make it effective enough. And the cool thing is that RNA bears no threat to being implemented into our genome since our body simply LACKS the necessary enzymes to do that. This technology means SO much more than just a one-time-vaccine. It's the fact that this technology is now ABLE to do what it was supposed to do all along. For pretty much the first time. This opens up treatment options for all diseases where a protein-antigen based immune response against a disease would be of help. And these my dear retards are a LOT of diseases. What this means is that they could simply identify mRNA which corresponds with the target protein that they want the immune system to be sensitized against and vaccinate you with it. Boom. That's insane.  


Now I also looked into the studies of the BioNTech vaccine and had a look at the side effects. All the side effects are simply signs of an immune reaction taking place (headache, muscle pain, chills) and were rarely stronger than "moderate". The thing that struck out to me also was that more people in the placebo group died (4 out of 21,828) than did in the treatment group (2 out of 21,823) which means it's very safe also.  


So idk about you guys but I take a little muscle pain for one or two days to be immune against HIV any day of the week and I think so will many more people. That's why I'm very optimistic and planing on holding my CFD positions for years to come.

Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/Nj34Qdp) leading the way up 0.5% and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/WcwDrN2) also finishing in the green, up 0.18% and ended over the 3700 level for just the 2nd time in history, while the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/Sdvkw4L) lagged and lost 0.15%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/w62QhvW) continuing to drop 1.7%, back to some more normal levels after the recent spike near 25.

Despite the broad market rally [yesterday](https://ibb.co/Z2qpxL2), about 55% of companies were losing ground on average volume, as we saw the Tech and Consumer Discretionary [sectors](https://ibb.co/BftQNpd) leading the way, while the only sector losing more than 1% for the day was the Utilities sector. As only Large-Cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/cyY67bQ) from the tech sector finished in the green, while small-caps and especially value play lagged behind.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/5LKrKdx) that most of the big tech names, Microsoft, Amazon, NFLX and even Alibaba which has suffered lately finished up well into the green, while the industrials and utilities were a big block of red.

We also got some economic data yesterday, with business [inventories](https://ibb.co/jZndKhQ) rising more than expected as sales increased by 0.9% month over month. We also saw retail [sales](https://ibb.co/XjqJyhW) falling 1.1% in November from the previous month, but this may be misleading, as sales actually rose by more than 4% year over year and by almost 6% after stripping out auto, gas and retail sales. 

We also continue to see the housing demand market being [strong](https://ibb.co/cTT9BjX) as the housing market index was down from the previous month, but came in at the second highest level ever.

One last number that we got was a reading on the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/Mg0pgHq), which came in at 55.7, below expectations and the last month number. This was the lowest reading in three months as growth momentum keeps slowing down as more restrictions are re-imposed, but this is still a strong expansion of the manufacturing and services.

[Today](https://ibb.co/fGq6Bqc) we will get some critical economic data, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims and housing starts, while we will also see get other important numbers later in the day.

So, we also got the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/ynQhYRg) yesterday, which for me personally, was a good indicator that stocks may still go up, as the bullish number of investors declined by 4.6%, with most of them switching to a neutral view of the stock market. There are still a lot more investors that are bullish compared to the historical average of 38% but, this is an improving in the last weeks, as this is a very good contrarian indicator. When more people tend to be bearish that is usually a good sign that you should just go and buy stocks, as you can mostly buy them at a discount, while when to many people are bullish, there is a significantly bigger risk of a pullback or correction nearing the stock market.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/5BwsTzH) we saw the FED keeping rates unchanged and signaling that they will continue to keep a near-zero rate through 2023 to support the economic recovery.

They also announced that the economy is expected to contract by only 2.4% in 2020, that is a big improvement from a contraction of 3.7% previously expected. They also expect the economy to grow by 4.2% next year and by more than 3% in 2022, with both revisions also being up from the previous estimates. They also vowed to keep buying bonds until there is substantial economic progress in the US, so they are expected to continue to buy $120B, with $80B in Treasury securities and another $40B in mortgage-backed securities.

Other revisions in the projected economic data also showed an improved outlook in the unemployment rate, which is expected to drop to 3.7% by 2023.

The FED Chief Powell also reinforced the commitment to aid the economy with even more easing if it deems it necessary while also suggesting they will give ample warning before tapering bond purchases.

This was happening while the congress was still haggling over details on a bigger $900B relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/PQBrH2Y). We also saw a major change from the last day as now it is expected that it will include a 600$ stimulus check and extended unemployment benefits. I think this must be agreed on as soon as today if it stands a chance of passing by the end of the week, even if Congress leaders have repeatedly told they will remain in session as long as needed, even working through the weekend, they should just put their act together and pass the stuff they can agree on so that uncertainty goes away, at least for the moment.

We also have some interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/vHCS87T) reports coming today with FedEx, BlackBerry and General Mills.

[FedEx](https://ibb.co/D89m06D) is expected to post an EPS of over 4$, that would be up almost 60% over last year with an operating Margin of 7.1%. FedEx has also just received an upgrade from Credit Suisse based on accelerating e-commerce trends with a longer and stronger holiday season than expected.

[JABIL](https://ibb.co/tL2qNRb) just reported while writing this post a nice surprise due to the high demand in the new Apple lineup, with a beat of 34 cents on earnings and almost $800M on revenues. The stock skyrocketed after the release.

We also got [Lennar](https://ibb.co/f9pLZxP) earnings after the close yesterday, as they beat the estimates easily, while also offering better numbers in new orders and guidance. As they expect more than 62K deliveries and 24% gross margins in FY 2021, that is up from 53K and a 20.6% gross margin in FY2020, this pushed the stock up 3% in after hours, in an unexpected move to the upside for me, despite my expectations for a great quarter for the company.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.

Meanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.

We Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected

Let‚Äôs hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

I posted DD about Gravity amount a month ago, and the stock is up like 50%.

My next play is the Momentus IPO next month, which is going public through a SPAC called **SRAC**. You can buy options on SRAC right now.

Momentus makes space vehicles that stay in space and take payloads to higher orbits or even lunar orbits. Think of it like package delivery. UPS flies your package to a major city, then a truck delivers your package to your house. Momentus acts as the local truck ‚Äì except it‚Äôs in space.

These days, there are so many small satellites being put into space. The companies that own the satellites pay for a ride on a large rocket. But that rocket delivers them only to a centralized location. A Momentus vehicle will be waiting in space to deliver them to their precise location in orbit.

Big rockets primarily go into lower-Earth orbits. Momentus vehicles can go into higher-Earth orbits or even lunar orbits and do it for much cheaper.

Momentus has customers including NASA, Lockheed Martin and others. It will put its first vehicle, called Vigoride, into space next month aboard a SpaceX rocket.

CEO Mikhail Kokorich has started several space companies, including publicly traded EchoStar.

The company also has some A-list investors, including Bill Ackman through his venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab.

There is precedence for this kind of successful deal. Virgin Galactic merged into a SPAC. Since going public, the stock has nearly tripled, and at one time, it was up more than four times its pre-IPO price.

**Catalyst**

The big catalyst will be the completion of the merger between Momentus and Stable Road Acquisition Corp., which will trigger the IPO of Momentus. It will trade under the ticker MNTS.

We had the pleasure of having [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) in for an [interview](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) and he dropped some good insight that I'll share here on everything Gamestop. Uberkiks11 has done DD so deep that he's basically an oracle at this point so strap in and get ready. I'll try and throw some key points down that I haven't seen covered in a lot of the other Gamestop DD. 

## the GME situation.

It should be no secret by now that people have been shifting away from Brick and Motor retailers and convenience shopping has largely shifted to online. We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop? 

While true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games. 

You know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags. 

Over this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection. 

Another addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).

## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?

Part of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job. 

## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.

Prior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce. 

Then there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice. Despite Sherms shitty corporate speak they are actually somewhat following Cohens letter just on Boomer time. 

## Beyond the Cohen rainbow

We should all be aware of Cohen at this point. But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who "employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy " or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store. So you're not alone in your holdings and its backed by some very big players in the game. 

## Where this leaves us?

So even ignoring the Ryan Cohen X factor, the short squeeze, and the other X factors this stock is a total value play. There is some much more detailed posts out there, notably the [infinity war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) post that dives into the numbers also worth a look at is [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) profile and associated accounts you can find on his profile. The additional X factors that could take this from a strong value play to an actual lottery ticket is Cohen and the infamous short squeeze but thats a story for another day. 

The Tl:dr is People still buy physical games, PS5 has limited space so yes physical disks aren't going away this console cycle. GME is shifting into bigger product categories, and they are backed by serious money. If you want to listen to Uberkiks11 go further into depth into the history of GME and the intricacies of this play you can listen and frankly do a much better job then this rough summary you can hear him in [full here](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6)

- Ticker GOEV is memeable beyond reason

- A fucking socialist Tesla with a business model worthy of 2020

And how the next day it went up almost 12% to $630? They're DESPERATE trying to bring the stock price down. Tesla knows that it will be hard to capture new talent if their stock trades at their 2025 earnings... that means no returns for those engineers if the stock goes down from here or trades sideways.

But see how hard it was to keep the stock under $600? Well there are a bunch of traders and fund managers that know that $600 is an important level of support and that keeping the stock down would lead to a chain selling reaction... they can't afford that. So they've been doing their best efforts to keep the stock below $650 and above $600.

**There are three forces at play here:** momentum hedge fund managers that bought shares in November and have been selling this week to secure profits; Tesla which tried to hit the stock hard selling 5 BILLION dollars in shares in ONE DAY (who does that if you want to keep the stock up?); and WEALTHY TRADERS that don't wanna be bag holders and are waiting for FRIDAY to send this stock to the moon.

All traders until now have been bag holders and funds. These traders will try to push the stock on Friday as far up as they can, I can see it going to $700 premarket and get a 20% day after that. **THE REAL WAR BEGINS NOW.**

I'm all in on this. It will be insane but we must fight like Spartans and I wanted to post this to give some perspective, because some of you might've felt discouraged by the couple last red days. But I think we can win this.

**AROO**

!!!!

EDIT:

Many champs saying that these funds have been buying up until now and will exchange the shares on addition date. First, there are trading funds that wanted to capitalize momentum but here we're talking the index tracking funds, these index funds don't wanna beat the index they must and want to imitate it, so they will try to add TSLA at as close of a price as possible to official closing price on Friday 12/18. Second, it is ILLEGAL as per SEC regulations to cross sell shares between funds even if the funds are own by the same company (E.g. Vanguard), SHARES MUST PASS THROUGH MARKET. That's why when Ark invest shows that they sold Tesla shares they show the shares sold per fund, or if one fund buys and the other sells they show in the trading report because the shares must pass through market, they can't simply move them from one fund to the other. DAMN CHAMPS

EDIT 2: Most of you have no idea how any of this works smh_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2020 markets in 12 seconds _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ S&P Inclusion destroys TSLA call trade - Actual DD Listen I am an autist . But ..

Ever since June (at $200/share), Tesla stock has been driven by a perpetual motion machine of hype and call option flows -- nothing more. And everyone knows it.

Here's what not everyone knows:

When a stock joins the S&P 500, it becomes part of a massive volatility complex, which is a terrifying web of arbitrage and pseudo-arbitrage relationships. Tesla will join the index as a top-ten component of a cap-weighted index. It's big.

Its bigness will allow all manner of dispersion, relative value, and market-making traders to begin relying on Tesla's newfound correlation to the index. This will invariably cause arbitrageurs to buy SPX options/vol and sell TSLA options/vol to "close the spread."

Since Tesla stock is driven by the returns on call options, it is a slave to "vanna": the relationship between option prices (implied volatility) and delta (stock exposure).

In other words, since June, $TSLA goes up only when implied volatility (IV) goes up.

When Tesla joins the index, these historic call option flows and the hype machine behind them will hit the big red fire truck that is the S&P, at 500mph

Implied volatility will be unable to rise. Call options will bleed value. New flows will be absorbed by real traders.

With the call option hype trade hampered, the stock will have no possibility of further returns -- a disgustingly ironic end to the most beautiful of @RobinhoodApp's many üöÄüöÄ children.

And an appropriately ironic fate for Tesla -- a victim of its own "success."

TLDR: arbitrgers killing tsla calls, sorry, the partys over. See you at $1000

While these companies are operating legally under state law, the does not recognize any exception or mitigation for "passive investment" in what is still a criminal activity or enterprise under federal law. Such activity also violates \[Director of National Intelligence\] and DoD policy that recognizes the supremacy of federal criminal law on marijuana possession and sales. Ownership of stock in these type of companies is recognized by as a security issue under their Adjudicative Guidelines, and puts your security clearance at risk.*

Corsair is basically a high-end gaming and streaming equipment company that serves ‚Äúdigital athletes‚Äù.  Their equipment is PC related rather than console related.

The good: Looking at their 10Q (the place where the numbers hide) from Q3 2020, we see that their gross profits have nearly doubled from this time last year.  They are achieving this through increased revenues of \~60% as well as decreasing the cost of revenue in relation to their revenue created by \~7%.  It is great to see a company that is in a strong growth phase and is still very profitable.  

Corsair is also increasing its cash holdings, nearly tripling what they had saved in cash this time last year.  This cash is from its September IPO though.  Assets are steadily increasing while liabilities are flat.  Their liabilities have rotated to more short term rather than long.  This comes from pretty aggressive debt repayment and an increase in accounts payable.  This is bueno.  

Cash flows also look great.  Fundamentally this company slaps.  

Also, the video game industry is a great one to be in.  Currently, the global video game market is valued at about $160 billion and is expected to have a CAGR of about 13%.  So we know the industry isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

The bad: the company is trading at 72x earnings currently (Based on $37.47 share price and $0.52 EPS.  This leads me to think that CRSR has very high expectations going into its next earnings announcement.  These expectations could lead to some serious short term volatility if earnings don‚Äôt go as planned.  Also, the IPO market is ridiculous right now and seemingly points to the bubble that we are likely in.  This could also just be the result of so many unprofitable IPOs recently that investors are happy to finally see a company with good fundamentals and not just pixie dust and unicorn farts. 

I think if it were me I‚Äôd be buying LEAPS like maybe 12/17 2021 $60c.  Possibly even pair it with some short-dated puts.

I'm surprised people aren't already significantly complaining about it. Once this reaches mainstream, people will start complaining on Twitter about Facebook and Facebook will either have to suffer a loss of customers, or they will change their policies to collect less information.

There are probably smaller market cap companies that will be affected much more by this, such as ZNGA, which sells location data to advertisers and depends entirely on mobile games.

(Outline of the article if you don‚Äôt have Forbes: [https://outline.com/Kzu3dy](https://outline.com/Kzu3dy))

VALE was very profitable at $96 iron - it is now at $150+! FANTASTIC margins!

Even if iron has a reasonable pull back, they will still be \*extremely\* profitable

http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/Press-Releases/ReleaseDocuments/PREREPORT3T20\_i%20vf.pdf  
"Vale‚Äôs iron ore fines production1 totaled 88.7 Mt, an increase of 21.1 Mt compared to the previous quarter.  
Vale‚Äôs pellet production totaled 8.6 Mt in 3Q20, up 21.1%  
Sales volumes of iron ore fines and pellets, with a premium of US$ 4.6/t3 , reached 74.2 Mt in 3Q20, an increase of 20.4%  
Production of finished nickel was of 47.1 kt in 3Q20, while sales volumes reached 58.2 kt, an increase of 37.3%, as a result of better prices in the quarter and more stable market conditions"

Macro conditions:

Every country is printing money to try to get out of this SARS recession - more money chasing the same commodities = prices of commodities soar

Every country will invest in infrastructure to create jobs and kickstart their economy (think of after the great depression)

Why I think VALE will benefit the most:

China normally buys their Iron from Australia (60% of the iron they buy)

However, in the last several weeks, the conflict between Australia and China has rapidly escalated - to where China has put on a ban on coal imports from Australia. It is fairly unlikely that China will outright ban Australian Iron (out of necessity); however, these increased tensions will incentivize Chinese Iron buyers to source their ore from non-Australian sources as much as they can

VALE being the #2 seller will capture Australian iron marketshare

Chinese iron buyers / steel producers want to increase their production to the MAX right now - the price of steel has never been higher! Since the price of steel is so high, they are incentivized to increase production and buy as much iron as possible - boost their inventories of iron, just in case there are supply disruptions / waitlists (no Chinese steel mill wants to have to halt production for a month while they wait to receive more iron) Increased purchases of iron at these record high prices is fantastic for VALE

Full disclosure: my position is VALE $16 Calls 4/16/2021  
As always, do your own DD - I would not recommend FDs - you want to ride February earnings rally

[https://imgur.com/a/Sn2fehS](https://imgur.com/a/Sn2fehS)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing guidelines r/stocks üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà My 8 investing guidelines.

I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boomer Schwab Logic _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who did it better? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I‚Äôve never seen a clearer message from god. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mama is putting our stimulus straight in to Robinhood now _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ /NQ Charts _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The MSFT üöÄ is just getting started, get in while IV is low \*\*\*\*TLDR BELOW WITH POSITIONS\*\*\*\*

Longtime Microsoft bull here with 10 years in the IT hardware and software sales field.

Following the september runoff, many tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN) have found themselves stuck in a range of resistance, leaving IV in the gutter. Now, tech bulls have returned with AAPL mooning and AMZN and MSFT showing some signs of life.

After 1 month, MSFT finally broke 217 and tested 220 today, but IV is still relatively low at 23.4%.

**MSFT for the short term -**

\- Some random whale threw 37 M on February calls

\- Recently reinstated as a buy by BofA

\- Broke threw resistance and even climbed higher- Stimulus seeming inevitable

\- Smart money is bullish

**MSFT for the long term -**

\- GREAT leadership - Satya Nadella transformed this company by investing in cloud and AI - this man has a vision for his company unlike other CEOs (looking at you Intel)

\- Recently acquired Bethesda, great for long term growth, esports are rapidly growing

\- Azure cloud is becoming a larger and larger competitor to AWS and Oracle - AWS began dominant, but Azure is clawing market share slowly

\- Teams and office 365 are irreplacable to companies and schools, covid cemented that

\- decent valuation with a solid p/s and p/e

Options are still cheap, so I'm picking up shares, leaps, and some shorter dated calls as the stock dips.

**TLDR: Microsoft is a strong company short and long term, recently broke through resistance and will climb freely in the coming weeks**

**Shares and leaps for the weak, calls expiring in a month for the brave**

**Positions: Jan 15th 225 C, April 16th 240 C, lots of shares**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Welcome to the casino.
