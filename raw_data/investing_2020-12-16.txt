Looks like most total market index funds have given 14-16% since 2010 annually. Its a pretty sweet number. 2000-2009 sucked and even when we average the 2010's with the 2000's you end up with a subpar return rate compared to the historic return rate of the sp500 (9%).

Now given past performance does not indicate anything about future performance I see both sides of the coin

Pros:

Hyperinflation/money being pumped, low bond rates (and expected to be low until 2023 - and still continue)- forcing people to not only borrow money but funnel their funds mostly into stocks. We have a growing population (and economy). Our tech sector (may) be overvalued but still is dominant. And other world economies seem to be shrinking as well as population

*^(Dec 15, 2020 | 07:00 PM EST)*

Money is continuing to flow towards the psychedelic sector as the group has become the hot spot for investors. Despite the issue that any payoff in this industry could be years away, companies are easily raising capital, and deals are quickly oversubscribed. The capital raises of 2020 could continue into 2021. Here's an example of some of the deals that have happened in just the past few months.

\-- In November, ATAI Life Sciences announced the successful closing of its $125 million Series C financing round, including $32 million of its 2020 convertible debt that converted in connection with the Series C.

\-- **COMPASS Pathways**  ([**CMPS**](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/CMPS.html)) closed on an $80 million capital raise in April 2020. Then the company upsized its initial public offering in of 7,500,000 American Depositary Shares at an initial public offering price of $17.00 per ADS for total gross proceeds of $127.5 million.

\-- **MindMed Inc.**  ([**MMEDF**](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/MMEDF.html))  just increased the size of its previously announced bought deal from C$50 million to C$80 million.

\-- **Field Trip Health** ([**FTRPF**](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/FTRPF.html)) entered into an agreement with Stifel Nicolaus Canada for a purchase, on a "bought deal" basis 3,333,333 units at a price of $4.50 per unit bringing in roughly $15 million.

\--**Seelos Therapeutics** ([**SEEL**](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/SEEL.html)) sold $12 million in senior secured convertible notes and shares of Seelos common stock to investors, including Lind Global Asset Management II, an investment fund managed by The Lind Partners, a New York-based institutional fund manager and an existing investor in Seelos. Seelos received $10 million in gross proceeds.

\-- **Numinus** had announced announce that it entered into an agreement with Canaccord Genuity  and Eight Capital for a bought deal basis that delivered approximately $10 million.

These deals show no signs of slowing down -- and that is setting up 2021 to be even bigger for the industry.

Ronan Levy, founder and executive chairman of Field Trip Health, said, "It is still very early days in the psychedelic renaissance, and the best is yet to come from a research and investment perspective. Psychedelic therapies stand poised to completely revolutionize the $240 billion U.S. mental health industry and start to address the $8 trillion economic cost of depression and anxiety disorders. Legal access is emerging through a number of different pathways, from FDA approval to ballot initiatives in the U.S. to a legal framework for psilocybin likely to emerge in Canada in 2021, and the interest and potential of these therapies is massive. It is hard to find an industry or opportunity with greater potential economic and humanitarian impact."

Indeed, Oregon legalized psilocybin during the November election for use at licensed facilities. Also in November, Washington DC decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms, joining cities like Oakland CA, Santa Cruz CA, Denver CO and Ann Arbor MI.

A spokesperson from **Cybin** ([**CLXPF**](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/CLXPF.html)) noted, "While some industries are struggling with economic hardship during the COVID pandemic, investors are increasingly lining up to support organizations working with psychedelics. We are going to see more Grassroots movements for decriminalization in states looking to advance psychedelics and the role they may play in improving mental health. There is now a lot of positive momentum and sentiment around psychedelics and I don't expect that to change in 2021. As more companies are formed and as more companies attract funding, I do expect to see more competition but also more potential M&A opportunities and consolidation. On balance, a continued positive marketplace." Cybin just raised C$45 million in October ahead of its move to go public.

Yaron Conforti, CEO and Co-founder of Novamind, which operates four ketamine-assisted psychotherapy clinics in Utah added that a second wave of psychedelics companies will go public in Canada on its junior stock exchanges in 2021. "Both the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and NEO have been accommodating to businesses focused on stigmatized compounds, psychedelics in particular. As capital continues to flow into the sector in 2021, leading companies will pursue dual listings on major American exchanges such as the NASDAQ," he added. "Mental health will be a major investment theme in 2021 given the impact of COVID-19 and psychedelic companies will be viewed as emerging healthcare and drug development companies. This will be validated in the capital markets by institutional capital moving into these stocks. Companies with sustainable medical business models or those doing real drug development will become must-own stocks for healthcare-focused institutional investors."

If the deal flow of 2020 in psychedelics is any indication of what investors will see in 2021, it will likely continue to be the hot industry. Covid hasn't hurt the deal making -- and as Conforti said, the after effects on Americans' mental health from months of social restrictions could certainly lead to a demand for relief.

What are your thoughts? Told my bank I was looking for something short-term like 5yr, with 4-5% pa returns and principal protected. And one of the products they came up with was CARN -  Callable Range Accrual Notes.

From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rangeaccrual.asp):

>**What is Range Accrual?**  
>  
>A range accrual is a structured product based on an underlying index whose returns are maximized if that index stays in the investor's defined range. Commonly referred to as range accrual note, it is a type of financial [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) that offers investors the potential to earn above-average returns by linking its [coupon rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) to the performance of the reference index.  
>  
>Other names for this derivative include accretion bond index range note, corridor bond, corridor note, range floater, and a fairway bond.

So, according to the bank and their sales pitch, it's something 'safe' as its principal protected, and the yields are somewhat okay considering the 'low risk'. And it can be leveraged, so I can double my returns. Also, I have to buy it in another currency, which I find odd. The reference index looks at  2 indices.

I looked around and asked around and I can't seem to find any info on the performance on such a product.

I want to keep an open mind and explore different avenues, but to me, it sounds too good to be true, there's got to be a catch. Maybe in the fees, maybe something. For one, why would the bank offer such a product? Are they trying to raise cash in that currency? Puzzles me.

Would love to hear from you folks what you think._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it no longer the case that "weak currency" correlates to "weak economy"? I've clung to the belief that forex rates are (somewhat) a measure of -- or at least a reflection of -- the "strength of an economy"; but that seems to be less and less the case. 

* EUR: It now takes $1.22 to buy €1, up OVER 10% from $1.09-ish a couple years ago.  I thought "Europe" generically was having a rougher time of it than the US, but apparently not, if the exchange rate reflects economy.
* GBP: It now takes $1.35 to buy £1, a HUGE increase from $1.15-$1.20s not that long ago.  With all the uncertainty of BrExit, how can the pound be SO strong against the USD?
* JPY: Yes, even the yen -- $1 now buys only ¥103, down more than 5% from its typical and very stable price of ¥109.  Japan is doing better than we are?

If the argument for USD support is "TINA", why is it continuing to weaken, as measured by forex?  Are we really doing this intentionally -- maybe to make it unattractive for Americans to spend their dollars in the rest of the world?  Is a "strong" currency really that much of a problem in today's global environment?

The market cap of the company jumps 800% and now speculators begin to take preemptive positions in a bet that the company may be included in the S&P 500. They know that if this happens passive S&P 500 tracker funds will be forced to buy huge tranches of Tesla stock regardless of price. This would create an artificial demand imbalance that would push prices higher, at least in the short term, allowing speculators to make a quick buck.

As the speculators jump in so the price of the shares climb to stratospheric levels and the market capitalization of the company climbs still further. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, passive funds would now need to buy even more Tesla stock which would push the price higher still. This fuels the speculation and we have a feedback loop detached from economic reality.

The benchmark administrator announces the inclusion of Tesla in the S&P 500 on 21 December 2020 and the share price, already up well over 1,000% year to date, jumps another 50% from $420 to $650 despite the economics of the company remaining unchanged.

The S&P 500 weighting of Tesla ($800M losses in 2019) is greater than that of Berkshire Hathaway ($81B profit in 2019).

My question is: What is a good target personal rate of return?  My past six months says 70.6% but I don’t know if that’s good or bad.  I don’t know my annual rate because I don’t have 12 months of trading experience.   How can I use this percentage to help me be a better investor?

Thanks!  Any advice is appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Analyst ratings and stock price I’ve been monitoring a list of stocks to buy in the future. Some of which have great year over year growth if you smooth this years toxicity over. I am taking multiple factors into account one of which is current analyst ratings. Some stocks which fairly good ratings appear to be in a bubble of an inflated value. Do the analysts take current stock price into account while assigning ratings? Also is there a a frequency to when these reports are posted?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Global vs US-centric clean energy ETF. Which would you pick? To use a specific example, let's say [PBW](https://www.etf.com/PBW#fit) vs [CTEC](https://www.etf.com/CTEC#overview).

**PBW** (Invesco Wilderhill Clean Energy ETF)

* Geographic breakdown: 82% United States. 10% China. 5% Canada. 2.6% Chile.

* Top 10 holdings: FuelCell, Blink, NIO, Plug Power, Livent, SunPower, Enphase, Dago, Maxeon Solar, Tesla (Top 10 comprise of 32.83%) ([See all holdings](https://www.etf.com/PBW#overview))

**CTEC** (Global X CleanTech ETF Mirae Asset)

* [Geographic breakdown](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/ctec/): United States 33%. South Korea 12.7%. China 11.7%. Germany 6.2%. Spain 5.7%. Denmark 5.6%. Canada 5.3%. Hong Kong, UK, Britain, Norway 2.7-3% each.

* Top 10 Holdings: Enphase, Solaredge, Plug, Xinyi, Vestas Wind, Siemens, Samsung, First Solar, Hanwha Solutions, Johnson Matthey PLC. [\(See all holdings\)](https://pastebin.com/GhMZuBbe)

Each fund has it's pros and cons. For example PBW has much longer history and you can trade options on it. But PBW is also higher in expense ratio at .7%, which seems kind of high compared to CTEC's .5% -- especially considering all PBW is doing is following an index. 

However, the question I want to focus on is whether you would invest in a fund that's mostly US-centric, or one that's more diverse? Which one offers more growth? More security? Why do you feel this way? Do you like [CTEC's picks](https://pastebin.com/GhMZuBbe)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking For The Best Bio Tech ETF I want to get in on the biotech industry because I believe it will do well and I'm excited to be part of companies that can improve lives. I'm aware of ARKG but it only focuses on genomics, I will probably get some ARKG in addition to whatever other ETF I choose. I want an ETF while I look more into the sector. 

Thanks for the suggestions in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here's my list of "contrarian" investment ideas. What are yours? Instead of focussing on hot areas like tech, I have been thinking of focussing on areas that have been beaten down due to pandemic but are sure to come back once the economies open back up 

Here's my list:

Airlines.

Hotels

Hospitality industry in General

Oil

Restaurant chain stocks

I am thinking about attending the 12 months & 6 months extra  courses and would love to know your opinions? I am worried whether the courses will be more basic, I felt I hadn't gained much from the first 2 days of the weekend. I feel my current knowledge with analysing business is fairly good. has anyone else felt they have been In this position? thanks.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/16/2020 **$AEYE:** This beautiful channel also has a channel up inside of it, and it is currently at a support area. It has great steam and does well in the middle of the channel. Stoch is low and curling, and it is above all EMA lines.

**$CRK:** Great horizontal channel here, and an ascending channel. It finally broke the downtrend. Has massive room to run, especially if it breaks the 200EMA. 

**$EXEL:** Finally broke the downtrend and now at a support. If it breaks the 200EMA go long for sure. It can't really get much lower than this!

**$GERN:** Great channel up, and at a support area which I love. If it breaks the downtrend and goes long, it is gonna go crazy. Stoch is low and RSI is near 40.

**$GIS:** The volume line is acting as a support, and holds very well here. It has to break both EMA lines moving forward, but it is oversold and Stoch is also very low. 

**$HZO:** May be too late for today - but it is great moving forward. Let it pull back to the golden channel if ya want, but it certainly has room to run.

**$NTES:** This support has high success and is currently living. The Stoch and RSI are both low, it has both EMA lines to beat, but that is how swinging goes.

**$PLNT:** Potential trend line up here, it has a history of slightly breaking the 50EMA and coming back; and at support. Stoch is oversold.

**$PTGX:** Beautiful trend line at a support? Love it. Bullish Divergence on the Stoch, with it being oversold? Love it. Go long.

**$YEXT:** 70% volume line holding as a support, and it is a great value. RSI oversold and Stoch is very low as well. Has a history of bowl shaped reversals like this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your favorite sources for tracking the market? There have been tons of stocks this year that I wasnt aware were doing so well until it was too late. I was to focused on specific sectors that I failed to see all the tech and biotech stocks (not just ZM and MRNA) that had 50%+ gains. I meed better sources to prevent this type of tunnel vision from happening again._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there Long Term Capital Gains on Options? I have a long term call that expires in 2022. I was wondering if this option will qualify as "long term" for tax purposes if I sell it after a year but before the expire date.

Also, I actually hope to exercise this option. So hypothetically, if it earned $10,000 in the 14 months I held it, and I exercised the option, but decided I wanted to sell half the stocks, would the $5,000 worth of stock I sold qualify as long term. Or would it be short term since I didnt actually own the stock until 2022. In which case, if I wanted a position in that company, would it be more tax efficient to sell the option a few days early, then just buy the amount of stock I wanted at market price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market sentiment?

I'm already heavily invested in clean energy but want to capture upside from Oil's current lows and also hedge against coming inflation (Oil tends to do well?) 

What's the best Oil play? I've read Occidental as they are in chemicals as well. Obviously want to avoid oil contracts with its contango and avoid tankers.

So yesterday I mentioned the possibility that CYBIN will soon qualify for Nasdaq, I did not mention they HD applied just that they “could” potentially at anytime now, after which a few people pointed out that Drysdale filled for up-list yesterday on SEDAR. It doesn’t not say Nasdaq but it has to either be Nasdaq or TSX as they already said Frankfurt and OTCQB are filled... any document experts on here have an opinion??_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think I'll have to give up trading, too many losses. So I've been trading for 3 months now. I actually started pretty solid making 900 USD on the first month, sadly my second was a disaster and ended up losing 7k in forex trying to get easy money (obviously). I took 2 weeks off to think about what I was doing and decided to get in again but trying to actually follow some rules and working on analysis etc. I ended red this month losing 1k more, almost all my moves went the other way around, I tried following the trend, looking for support and resistance but almost always ended up going the other way around. I feel frustrated because when I lost 3k I was about to close my account but I ended up trying once more and ended up much worse.I am a very young professional. The money I lost represent about 6 months of savings, since I live alone and earn a lot I am able to save about 2k per month, that's why I'm not broke already. I am thinking into moving to a more passive way of savings and just put money every month in a company that invest for me with about 4% return per year. Do you guys think this is a wise decision? Maybe save that money and actually buy some real stocks instead of speculating in the market?I could have bought a Bitcoin in September and I would have made literally 10k...
