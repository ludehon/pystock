https://i.imgur.com/IKiFB9X.png_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $JD JD.com is China’s Amazon Fellow Bettors,

JD.com ($JD), a stock some may know, has seen massive returns over the past year, for good reason. It is China’s largest e-commerce retailer in terms of revenue and offers same-day delivery to 98%+ of the Chinese population. You read that right, SAME-DAY to nearly ALL of the Chinese population. These guys sell everything too, from frozen foods and produce to that new gaming system for the family. What they have done from their start in a four-square meter shopping mall to now is unmatched globally. They now have over 800 warehouses throughout China and are about to release a fleet of 100,000 autonomous delivery robots (pictured below) over the next 5 years. They already have released a fleet in the city of Changshu and has seen *great success*

https://preview.redd.it/sfnb5yw8um561.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=116bd1f65b730b6951e4f8c2f1e023fdfbb6894f

Imagine, 100,000 of these little robots flying around China delivering packages to deliver your fresh new groceries, or a new e-sports helmet, that you ordered that same day. Not even Walmart Plus does this. This autonomous fleet that JD has already rolled out is the only Level 4 Autonomy Vehicle/Fleet in the open market today and is head and shoulders above Amazon and Tesla in this market

Here are some more key stats that should make some more dicks hard: JD LTM Annual active customers: 440 million, more than the US population and growing by more than 100 million people in the past year. This is also less than 25% of the Chinese population, a large portion of whom will likely begin using JD.com services in the upcoming years JD logistics (delivery) network generates 31 petabytes of data every day, (that’s like 31 million gigabytes or something) LTM Revenue of more than $100 billion (will continue to grow at more than 20% a year, expected by the analysts) They're finally starting to see profitability too, their EBITDA/EBITDA Margin has a strong growth rate of more than 100% over the past two years (Huge leading fundamental indicator of future growth and profitability) Revenue is more than double the size of the next largest E-commerce player in China ^(for) everyone that thinks Alibaba is, no wrong, just wrong. Alibaba exports products from China to other countries, they only sell about $10 billion worth of goods in domestic China. The reason we know Alibaba is because they EXPORT goods to us. JD competes on a whole different level, selling directly to Chinese consumers.

JD Health IPO in Hong Kong that's up 40% since joining the capital markets

If we look at the charts below that compare multiples, we can obviously see that JD is about to go to the fucking moon.

For everyone that doesn't know what the hell they're looking at: first, look at the Chart comparing Amazon JD Alibaba and Tencent.

https://preview.redd.it/oilyy9maum561.jpg?width=2509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7333295944cccbaff5dddf3f7f4f46e43c6f7b10

This shows how dissimilar JD.com is to other major Chinese e-commerce and internet companies and how similar it is Amazon. The most important part is the comparison of revenue multiples with JD and Amazon in the early 2010s. Amazon traded around 1.0x revenue for years before skyrocketing to a 5.0x multiple nowadays. This means investors value Amazon 5x more today than they did 10 years ago, and we've seen how that's played out. But what led this growth you might ask? That is shown on the Amazon multiple comparison chart, from 2012 to 2014, Amazon had an incredibly high Enterprise Value to Unlevered Free Cash Flow multiple, obviously not many of you know what this means. To make it short, Amazon took all the money they were making and invested it back into the company, that's what the spike in the blue line means in 2012-2013.

https://preview.redd.it/lnlhqm6cum561.jpg?width=2509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6116a320a0b84d8ab5600fdb7aa673a7513e1ec5

Now, look at the JD multiple comparison chart. This shows the exact same pattern as Amazon did about 10 years ago and shows that JD has spent the past few years, and a lot of its history, investing in themselves to produce a great product.

https://preview.redd.it/u8tt9icdum561.jpg?width=2509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71f1cb254bc037657ce6343eb90fb4712b14f40

A lot of that last paragraph probably didn't make sense, so here's a TLDR: Investors value and think of JD in a similar way to Amazon 10 years ago. Amazon's growth since then has been lead by massive investment into the company, the charts show JD has been doing that same thing and has seen similar returns to Amazon. This, along with a lot more extensive financial analysis that has been done, shows that JD isn't just going to the Moon, but Mars.

To give you all a quick valuation: assume JD trades at it's trailing six-month average revenue multiple of \~1.2x (which is a very boomer and bear thing to assume no multiple expansion that aligns with competitors); JD will report revenue of around $115 billion by consensus analyst opinion; ($115billion)(1.2x)=Enterprise Value of $138 billion; convert that to market capitalization(the value of the stonks we trade) and that is $95 per share, $15 more than the current share price, or a 17% premium.

That valuation is a bear case valuation, other bullish scenarios put that number much much higher.

My last point before regathering my brain cells is this, this company is doing things that are unmatched globally and are outcompeting Tesla, Amazon, Google,etc... in terms of data analysis, logistics and most importantly, autonomy. JD.com has invested into their business and created something absolutely absurd that allows them to have self-built and automated factories with 4 employees than then send packages out to be delivered that same day. Crazy thing is, this actually makes their employees more money too, which helps stay within the restrictions of the Chinese Government and Xi Jinping.

MT taking us to the top of Mount Tendies Every article you see on the internet is about demand of steel increasing and not enough supply. Which is taking price per ton of steel to the highs of 2018.

Ask any steel buyer and they say they see price increasing into 2021. Go ask r/steel. They've said the same thing. Steel producers are making buyer their cucks and keep increasing their price and no end to sight. 86% of steel buyers polled say they are expecting to continuing to get raw dogged by producers and the price increasing: [https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/article/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-defy-predictions-of-a-peak](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/article/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-defy-predictions-of-a-peak)

There is basically a shortage and will continue to get greater.

They expect to keep being cucks to the producers until Q1 at least.

In short, there is not enough steel to go around. Not even enough for the autist's helmets in this sub. The shortage is starting and expecting to carry over into 2021. Last time their was a shortage in steel around 2011 MT was around 100. The last time the prices were this high per ton for steel in 2018, MT was at 39.

2/19 29c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SFIX -- they sell clothes online and basically doubled in a week  Stitch Fix (SFIX), a retail e-commerce company (they market it as “an online personal styling service”), had an 85% runup in 9 days; driven by a beat on revenue growth expectations last quarter

**Quantitative considerations/the story so far (pull up chart when reading this):**

Before earnings, there was a lot of short interest in the shares themselves, with around 40% of the float short. On the option chain, the $35 strike puts had really high open interest/volume (i think someone on r/thecorporation said it was a good play so it got piled into). 

This massive imbalance in puts vs. calls was the reason behind the massive 38% gap up after reporting. In order to hedge the puts they sell, market makers have to short shares. When results were good, MMs took the opportunity to rapidly cover all their shorted shares and forced a short squeeze to destroy all the puts they sold (also exploiting IV crush around earnings). All the other shorts also had to start covering, and the put destruction/short squeeze created the huge 38% gap.  

Then, seeing the 38% gap, retail traders all FOMOd in, and call options on the 12/18 chain were relentlessly pumped — first the $50 strike, then $55, $60, and $65. In the same way as the puts above, market makers hedge sold calls by buying shares, and have to buy more and more shares as those options get closer to being in the money — this feedback loop + the feedback loop from shorts/put destruction has been behind the pump the whole last week. 

Volume started to drop off at $65 level and the sellers started to return this week — option flow indicators had increased activity in 12/24 SFIX puts as whales decided they had enough of the pump (insiders btw were dumping shares as soon as the stock crossed $50 lol). 

The stock was rolling over and dropped to around $63 until the FOMC pump happened and the whole market went up, and big green candles from MMs re-hedging puts that got destroyed + exhausted shorts covering caused the final pump to $66 today.

**Current setup/prediction:**

As it stands now, we have insanely overextended call positioning on the 12/18 expiry, but this quickly flips towards more balance between calls/puts on 12/24 expiry because of the earlier put buys from whales at $60 and below strikes on Mon/Tues (a lot of these contracts are at huge discounts right now from when the big boys bought them lol).

This means that market makers currently have a lot of SFIX shares ready to dump (they were forced to buy them all by call pumpers). They can dump on Friday to try and kill the calls before expiry, or just wait for all the OTM calls to expire and dump all the shares Monday morning when they no longer have to hedge. This selling volume will start to drive the share price back down.

Now, consider how the 12/18 expiry and resulting sale of shares will affect how market makers hedge the 12/24 options. This time they have also sold a large amount of puts, and as these puts get closer to the money, MMs will have to short more and more shares to hedge their deltas/gammas, creating the same feedback loop that caused the pump but in reverse. 

*TLDR:*

Pre-earnings, the overextended positioning in puts caused a massive upward feedback loop, and MMs took advantage and covered all their shares to create a short/put squeeze. 

Pre-12/18 opex, the overextended positioning in calls will cause a similar downward feedback loop when MMs dump shares and create a call/long squeeze, and we can amplify this by piling into puts.

From Investopedia: “Long squeezes are more common in assets that have seen a dramatic price rise with very high volume occurring when the price turns lower (dip before earnings followed by massive rip), and in low liquidity or low float stocks (check and check)”

**Fundamental considerations:**

—> keep in mind these barely matter in the short term, especially in this postmodern market, but it does add some color to why there are still people who want to short + explains part of why MMs don't hold their shares (aside from the 85% run in basically a week lol)

Online e-commerce has outperformed wildly in the COVID market, and stocks like Etsy, Wayfair, Shopify, etc. have killed it. One main reason for this is the fact that consumers’ travel/entertainment budgets have basically been nuked due to the pandemic, and that wallet share has flowed over to retail — specifically, e-commerce.

While pandemic trends led to a strong couple quarters for SFIX, don’t expect these tailwinds to last forever. Now that we have a vaccine, the focus of the market has shifted from pandemic to reopening — commodity stocks, airlines, cruises, brick and mortar retail all have been running up in the recent weeks. The wallet share that has flown to retail will quickly return to travel/entertainment, as pent up customers will love the chance to go outside again. Money that still remains in consumer retail budgets won’t all stay in e-commerce; many people will go right back to malls and stores to shop. The coming year will likely be a tougher one for SFIX, especially with high pandemic growth to compare to as the new standard.

Furthermore, don’t be fooled by the company’s marketing to frame itself as a tech company deserving of a higher multiple. It’s still a retail business at its core, with retail profit margins, not tech profit margins. While they do use “recommendation algorithms and data science to personalize clothing items based on size, budget and style,” SFIX has a \~44% gross margin, not 80% like the fast growing software companies that actually do deserve a high valuation.

**The play(s):**

The safest play is to thetagang and sell 12/18 calls — this is basically free money when MMs dump hedged shares. 

The high risk/high reward option: buy 12/24 puts, $60 strike, or $58 strike — that’s where all the volume/open interest is for puts. You’re buying what the big boys did for cheaper, and contributing to the feedback loop that will tank the share price when 12/18 options expire.

Medium risk: buy 12/24 $65 strike, sell $60 strike. Spread so not as hurt by IV, less OTM so not as risky.

**The plan:**

I’m looking to buy 12/24 puts on any spike tomorrow, and probably gonna hold until Monday morning if not longer. If enough of us buy puts, the resulting feedback loop will be massive and super profitable. 

These feedback loops that come from MM hedging flows are the key to trading meme stocks profitably — keep a sharp eye out for when MMs have an incentive to squeeze one side or the other, and join in for max tendies. 

Tip: the feedback loops/squeezes always happen near earnings/opex because thats usually when sentiment/positioning is at its most skewed_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [REPOST] Quarterly - It's early assignment time!

Hopefully you've been holding for at least a month or two and this doesn't come as a surprise to you. There's been great DD on here. H C A C is a SPAC merging with Canoo, an EV company building customizable vehicles for retail, b2b, and industry that rely on a proprietary 'skateboard' (base electrical mainframe with a vehicle's four wheels) and 'top hat' system (different model builds, the 'type' of car, gets attached to the skateboard) that enables concurrent production lines. They can pump them out, and they have a deal with Hyundai to use Hyundai's production infrastructure. Production speed is already outpacing competition just in prototypes. The leadership is ex-BMW and -VW Audi designers/engineers.

You can check out the vehicle design here [https://www.canoo.com/design/](https://www.canoo.com/design/) and the real gold here [https://investors.canoo.com](https://investors.canoo.com), the investor presentation is unreal. They have a great product and plan to bring to market. Where they're really changing the game is the subscription model - "transportation as service" - which includes the vehicle, insurance, customizability (factory printed and applied, artist-designed skins). You should check it out for yourself and see if you like the vision. Regardless, price is going up. This is a company that can easily go to $50, surpass a NIO, and hit $100+ on Tesla's back. Average volume in November was under 500k and now we're seeing 7+ mil. They presented at Credit Suisse last week and this week they'll reveal the B2B product. Next week the ticker changes and then it's really over. Long calls and shares on dips. Hopefully you caught the holiday sale yesterday. If not, watch carefully.

To all my H🍆 bag holders, we ride baby. 👅💕

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/23/e-commerce-unicorn-wish-files-for-ipo/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ INNOVIZ TECH TO THE MOON. EV Play. Alright guys, so we've all witnessed the SPAC Smackdown over the last couple days. This correction was inevitable. *Hopefully* all of you saved some fresh powder for this exact moment because for a very short period of time, everything is on sale.

That's where Innoviz comes into play. They're relatively new to the SPAC game and after seeing a quick surge during the initial announcement, the SPAC smackdown has kindly dropped this into the purchasing range - at least for the time being.

&#x200B;

**What is Innoviz and why should I care?**

>"Innoviz is a leading provider of high-performance, solid-state LiDAR sensors and perception software that enable the mass production of autonomous vehicles."

The SPAC, Collective Growth Corp - aka \[**C G R O**\], has taken on the challenge of reverse merging with Innoviz, providing a short window of tendie opportunity for the masses.

[https://innoviz.tech/](https://innoviz.tech/)

&#x200B;

**The Facts**

* Valuation of 1.4 Billion with 350m proceeds
* *SHAREHOLDERS RETAIN 100% EQUITY <-------------------* ***This is incredibly rare, usually a lot lower***
* Expected merger in Q1 under the ticker \[I. N. V. Z.\]
* The only LiDAR provider that meets the stringent requirements of automotive OEMS
* Production is expected to start in 2021
* Partnered with BMW to be used in their autonomous vehicles
* Can be used for robotaxis, delivery vehicles and drones as well

&#x200B;

Now we all know that there's a couple other LiDAR companies floating around the WSB universe. Both Luminar and Velodyne have done very well in regards to stock price - this goes to show that LiDAR is an important aspect of the EV future. The Luminar rocket to 40.00 was insane.

&#x200B;

**Luminar** is currently trading at **24.45**

**Velodyne** is currently trading at **20.10**

&#x200B;

This is why time is of the essence. Thanks to Innoviz being relatively new/under the radar and the current SPAC correction we're experiencing, the stock is currently trading in the ***11***'s

***One can argue that there is plenty of room to grow. This company already has a partnership with BMW and will be a large player in the LiDAR game. Go check out their LiDAR videos on the current website.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; EV play. New global leader in LiDAR sensors that's under the radar and trading at a steal of a price thanks to SPAC correction. Two direct competitors, Luminar and Velodyne, are both trading well above Innoviz's SPAC price - only a matter of time until this ticker follows suit. Luminar has Volvo? We have BMW.

Ford is just too cheap to pass up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lets talk about Friday Fellow autists,

This Friday is a quad-witching , index rebalancing and TSLA’s final day before SP500 inclusion. Let’s discuss these possible plays. Pick strikes based on your preferred gambling investment strategy. This a discussion starter, not DD.

**SPY put exp 12/18, buy 12/17**

Every stock in the SP500 index is facing sell pressure as funds make $80billion worth of room on Friday for $TSLA. Indexes will use 12/18 closing price to add the stock for 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• 12/18 will be very high volume anyway, will the sell pressure get drowned out?

• Selling could take place AH/Dark pool. Will we see it intraday?

• Stimulus announcement off the top rope

• Bears are gay

**TSLA calls 12/24, buy 12/17**

$80billion worth of shares need to be bought by market open 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Is a full $80billion still needing purchased or have steady purchases already been made over the past month (when the stock was cheaper)?

• Run-up to inclusion is unpredictable plus TSLA already gained 50%+ since announcement

• IV is well over 100%

• Indexes are using end of day 12/18 price to buy TSLA. Big purchase would happen between close 12/18 and open 12/21.

• Careful holding longer than 12/21, see next play

**TSLA puts 12/24 or later, buy 12/21 (end-of-day to be safe)**

Stocks predominantly lose 15-20% after S&P inclusion starting immediately after. This is a well-studied phenomenon with a large sample size to back it up. Could be a sell-the-news event starting regardless. Can’t go tits up!

Not-so-obvious complications:

• TSLA is a unicorn with rare circumstances like never being in the S&P 100 before inclusion and coming in as the 6th heaviest weight in the index

• Shorting TSLA is terrifying

• TSLA short shorts on backorder due to high demand

**BONUS PLAY: UPS straddle 12/18, buy 12/17**

Fedex earnings 12/17. Expectations are excellent numbers, excellent outlook. Vaccine distro included in outlook. Play the earnings without the IV crush using its peer UPS. UPS IV is 30%. Pick a direction and tempt the earnings demon or buy a straddle and profit on any decent movement either way (3% minimum). Look at previous earnings by FDX or UPS for examples. Synergizes well with Play #1 - SPY put 12/18

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Low movement could hurt, wrong side of the straddle gunna take a big L regardless

• This sounds smart enough to somehow not work

**POSITIONS: Still riding $TSLA 460c 1/15/21**

tl;dr - Read the bold letters_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FOMC Cliff Notes: what actually happened so you don’t sound dumb to your friends **This is an updated version of a previous DD I did on what could come from the FOMC meeting.  I see a lot of wild shit on the daily thread when the market started responding, so I threw this up with some edits to help y’all out.**

For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms: 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep

The first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it was very, very unlikely we were going to see change to them.

**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**
Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)
Last year this time: 1.75%
**Any changes? NO**
The Fed rate is  not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--also didn't happen

**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**
Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)
This has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  The long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.
**Any changes? NO**
Given that the stimulus talks are up and down and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking, there has been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  JPOW chose not to create panic by expanding this

If those changes were unlikely, why did the market not immediately love it?  Or why has it been up and down? Because some market participants were holding out for...

**1) Fed weaking not the amount—but instead which—treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities**
The Fed could've decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could've ended up providing a fairly large boost to stonk purchases without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There was chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and they didn't make that move.
**Did it happen? NO**

**2) Outcome-based guidance**
This sounds like bullshit but it's not.  This essentially means "the Fed will tie QE for 2021 to how the economy performs".  The reason it's not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.
Did this happen? YES
But it was pretty vanilla language.

**TLDR**: The FOMC meeting released info that was exactly as expected, but markets are a little disappointed/up and down absurdly because they didn't offer more aggressive stonk stimulus by moving around their investments in bond maturity updates.

**Positions: this is more info than predictions but I’m leaning:**

The product that got hacked is a well known, well used, piece of software that helps organizations more easily manage networks. Organizations pour millions into the projects to get this shit setup, and once it's setup, they do not want it to change. SolarWinds does pretty good at making sure the shit you set up continue to work. And, for the most part, people LIKE the software (event though a lot of people have some qualms about their sales guys).

So they got hacked, big whoop. Over 400 of the F500 companies use their product. These ancient and slow moving companies who run projects for over a year to get a piece of software like this installed and working. Do you REALLY think that they're going to try and replace it? The answer is NO. The most likely scenario is gonna be this:

IT/Sec team: 'hey this software got hacked, Mr. budget guy in the business dept can we have money to replace it?'

mr budget business guy: 'o no, is it broken? how much cost'

IT/Sec team: 'its not broken but we lost data :(, uhh millions and a lot of time'

mr budget guy: 'did they fix it'

IT/SEC team: 'yes but we dont feel good about them'

mr budget guy: 'ok just use the fix since we already paid for '

That is all _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bull Case for LAZR - Next Potential TSLA Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million by YOLOing into NVAX (peep the profile), here is my next play. I recently liquidated the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped the majority of that money into LAZR.

For those who don't know LAZR is a Peter Thiel backed company specializing in LiDAR technology for vehicles, that just underwent a SPAC merger. This caused the stock to skyrocket 300% within three weeks. The stock is still up 150% just this month even following this past week of consolidation and bad news.

The main reason that the stock was falling this past week, aside from consolidation was due to a hit piece by Shitron (Citron). If you are part of this community you know that Citron is utter market manipulating dogshit. It started to recover yesterday, until news came that Mobileye (an Intel subsidiary) would be producing its own in-house LiDAR technology. This caused the stock to fall another 20%.

However, this was a complete market overreaction. The main reason for recovery today is that LAZR was given a price target of $41 by Northland's Gus Richard (a 5 star analyst, much more competent than the retards at Citron), as well as an upgrade from Market Preform (Hold) to Outperform (Buy). 

https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/gus-richard

If every thing goes as planned, Mobileye will not have produced in house sensors by 2025. He stated that he doubts Intel would be able to successfully produce this in time.  Given Intel's terrible year, there should not be much confidence behind them.

If you are bullish on any of the Chinese electric vehicle stocks, you should be bullish on LiDAR as well as they are using this technology in their car. Even Elon Musk is afraid of this technology. The fact that he is denouncing this technology clearly indicates to me that it is a threat to him.

Why LAZR over VLDR?

VLDR is the industry leader. However, it is clear that LAZR's sensors are much more powerful and cheaper to produce. The CEO literally invented a brand new microchip because the current ones in the market weren't good enough. Speaking of the CEO, he is a big dick 25 year old youngest new billionaire in the world. He was given 100,000 by Thiel to drop out of Stanford and pursue LAZR. VLDR uses a LiDAR unit that stacks 64 lasers in a vertical column and spins the whole thing around many times per second. This is incredibly expensive to produce. LAZR instead uses a single mirror to focus and guide its lazer, making it significantly cheaper.

TLDR: Buy LAZR.

First off, Lemonade takes out agents (and their expensive commissions) and instead use AI. In addition, they use chatbots so that people can get a new policy and have a claim processed in a couple minutes. Plus, they have insanely good reviews by everyone who uses their service.

On top of this, insurance is a larger industry than cars, so Lemonade has the potential to grow even larger than Tesla is right now. It is only at a 5bn dollar evaluation. Imagine being one of those autists that got Tesla leaps a year ago.

The stock is currently trading at around $7 from a high of $12 in september 2019, so the market is pricing a zero probability of this occurring.

**Why is the market so skeptic regarding this event?**

Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, and the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Rodrigo Maia, hate each other guts (think Trump and Pelosi), blocking any attempt of getting this privatization through congress.

**So why should I buy this shit company ?**

Rodrigo Maia term as Speaker of the House is finishing in january 2021 and he has been blocked from running another term by the Supreme Court. This was totally unexpected, everyone in Brazil thought he was gonna be reelected.

Bolsonaro was extremely happy with this news, and has started campaigning to get one of his allies, Arthur Lira, as Speaker of the House.

I can’t understand how we were able to buy $AIV during the whole process of the split.  Lots of people bought shares at $10-$20 before it ultimately ended up around $5. I’ve even heard of someone buying after the split but before the drop, so not only did they experience a 90% loss, they also didn’t get the $AIR shares.

Sure all the usual suspects are already on the list (green energy, ev plays, short private prisons) but I was looking for something that can have a marked reversal but has been under the radar and I think I found it.

**Calls on CHL ($35 price point or above, DTE of at least 6 months)**

Why CHL?

1) This is the biggest telecom company in China (on a subscriber base) paying a very stable dividend and now yielding 7%. From all fundamental basis the company should be trading at least 30% higher.

2) CHL has been pummeled by all out Trump rethoric and most recently by the ban through executive order ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/order-against-owning-some-chinese-stocks-might-not-be-as-bad-as-it-sounds-51605220714](https://www.barrons.com/articles/order-against-owning-some-chinese-stocks-might-not-be-as-bad-as-it-sounds-51605220714))

3) At a time where telecom has been doing great, the 40% correction of CHL solely based on Trump fear is unwarranted.

**So why will it get better?**

1) We got a new President. Yes, Biden will face a litmus test of being "soft on china" and reversing the ban could be a no-go for him. But here's the kicker: this is an executive order by a previous President. Biden can include it in a pool of other orders are "stupid stuff from Trump" reverse them all and done deal. No justification, no anything. This will be looped with so many orders that when the questions come it will be about immigration and EPA regulations. It will fly under the radar as it should because it is a stupid rule that only hurts American investors. CHL does not need access to US markets. 

2) Only about 2% of the float is in the American ADR but it is owned mostly by large funds which still largely retain most of their position throughout all of this ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=CHL&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=CHL&subView=institutional)). Goldman Sachs for example acquired almost 500k shares in September right when Trump rhethoric was heating up. Any move up will happen in a very small float and it won't take long to hit $40 which is a super strong TA support.

TLDR: Calls on CHL >$35 with at least 180DTE

My concern with new indexes like C3.AI and Airbnb was that of everyone, that they are/were over valued. However, following trends like other tech stocks that were newly available like PLTR to retail investors, these stocks shot up, slumped and start making the climb after options become available.

With Airbnb and AI, however, they had unique IPOs that could/would have had a different trend but as of this morning it seems it is doing  exactly as anticipated and I expect this to continue for 30-45 days like PLTR.

I can’t afford any more options on C3.AI or Airbnb but still hope for some hefty gains as I’m already up 30 percent. Those looking to buy in, wait until the afternoon when some of the volatility priced in cools off because I made the mistake of buying in at 9am for $15 calls yesterday instead of $12 and they’re currently at $18 and rising. Airbnb is similarly expensive

Concerns: overvaluation and IPO methods may create alternative trends as well as AI being a “boomer” stock. Also, $TSLA inclusion in the S&P500 May create a tech slump or even crash so that it might be better to wait till Monday or Tuesday next week to buy into this idea.

Positions: $AI 145c 4/16/21

3. DASH drivers get paid shit and have been bitching about it a lot. If gov'ts say that these drivers have to be considered employees (which yeah duh, they are), then the DASH model makes no economic sense bc all of a sudden DASH would have to pay for luxury things like health care
4. UBER eats has significant cost advantages over DASH because they can always switch to deliver food and people at the same time. Sure the delivery might take a little longer, but you won't pay $20 for a cheeseburger

If you fly this not financial advice to 🚀 tendie town on the moon  🚀 I won’t stop you from sending a pittance back to earth


*Part 1: Vaccine (the better one)*

I see all this loss porn of bets on PFE vaccine and can only ask why? That shit is way past news at this point and for the most part so is Moderna, but more importantly those two vaccines suck. Buy the rumor sell the dip, and you’ve probably heard -70 degrees for storage and transport but in America thats 100 below... those sciency guys and their lab coats always talk in Celcius. Its damn hard to keep stuff this cold and that means not every clinic, truck, or plane can do it — and if you have something that might be able to do it but shit gets too hot for the *ice queen vaccines* then suddenly you have to throw out a truckload of hard to produce doses.  Shitty


This matters specifically during a pandemic multiple ways. You can’t get that kind of low ass temp to most of the world’s population, and where you can get it you still have high transport and storage costs or risks. Add on to that the fact that buyers in a pandemic are governments buying at a low profit margin and acutely aware of these costs and risks.  PFE and MRNA can’t match future competition transport prices by cutting into vaccine profits because those are low from the start, and PFE and MRNA can’t even get vaccines to huge amounts of the worlds population without completely unreasonable loss and expense — they’ll make more money paying AZN half of the difference for AZN to ignore cities and truck to the country.

The AZN vaccine, even in cities, can probably add some profit margin and still come in cheaper per dose for governments because you can produce it easily then throw that shit in a Trader Joes frozen food delivery truck and when it gets to a clinic in the middle of nowhere the clinic’s hand-me-down fridge from Circuit City is perfectly fine. This is not great for the stock yet as AZN is distributing at cost for the start, but if we find that booster doses are needed then it will definitely matter. This isn’t even getting into the fact that the mild first-shot side effects are less likely to prevent people from coming back for their second shot which really helps governments get higher immunity at a lower price.

Now, this vaccine may not be priced in and it may even be discounted by the thing that screwed my AZN 12/31 $54.5c: AZN offered to buy ALXN at a $12B premium.


*Part 2: Merger and Offer (and 2x leverage)*

ALXN officially received an offer where each shareholder gets 2xAZN (actually 2.1243 but who cares about 6.25%) shares and $60 per share. At the time of the offer that value was $175/share, but did you catch the leverage? Thats right, AZN goes up $2 the offer goes up $4. ALXN is hovering below $160 so $4 is below in percentage to an AZN climb of $2, but calls are in dollars from the strike price not dollars from zero therefore 2x leverage. If you’re cray cray, the second ticker might also lag behind the first giving you a chance get in on a movement that already happened over at AZN and maybe even get 2x the price shift.

The timing of the merger being finalized means the movement is not 1:1 (or 1:2) right now, but it will be and consider the next part as a reason to get in sooner. Also, ALXN can’t go down hard because the lower AZN goes the lower the percentage correlation will be with a drop in ALXN, and a large drop of say 10% in a company like AZN right after the market corrected AZN is like you and sex with your wife (just not going to happen). The next part also has a reason to expect the merger not to get blocked by regulators, but first lets talk stupidity and whether that AZN correction was irrational.

Ok fellow stupid, one reason this can’t go tits up is that the offer was not done by idiots.  You and I certainly don’t know more than the board of AZN, but when debating regulatory hiccups and what a fair price was for ALXN the market hasn’t realized it knows less about drugs — AZN tanked by as much as $8B implying that maybe the market only wanted them to offer a $4B premium instead of $12B. AZN stated they see a pretty easily attained $500M/year advantage by sharing efforts between the companies, but there’s definitely hidden benefits (like competitors not buying ALXN).  I don’t know all the synergies they see but among them would be the fact that distribution of drugs, dealing with insurance companies, sending drug pushers into clinics to convince doctors to put pamphlets in your face... it isn’t cheap, and right now both companies are probably overlapping a whole lot in these efforts even though they have basically zero overlap in products.


*Part 3: Bidding War*

This bidding war is not just likely, it is likely to get going fast. The next offer could already be on the way to ALXN because a large ALXN activist investor wrote a letter ([elliottletters.com](https://elliottletters.com/) has a copy) back in May urging the company to sell — AZN competitors like Amgen, Gilead, Novartis, Eli Lily, PFE and others have definitely been doing their analysis and planning their offers for months, AZN was just first to the table.

The buy value bidders see in ALXN is also why regulators won’t stop it.  ALXN focuses on drugs for extremely rare diseases, putting them in a tiny but profitable niche where they don’t make anything that competes with the buyer, but they do and need things that the buyers also do an need — there’s nothing but synergy potential.  Typically buying a competitor means you might be paying for a bunch of shit that is in the target company’s stock value only to compete with you and that is a double hitter because it is a waste of your buying capital and regulators don’t like that the merger will kill off consumer choices.

So what does this mean? ALXN is going to get a huge premium in its offers because there’s no waste besides the premium, and regulators won’t stop it for the same reason. This is why ALXN price targets are up closer to or at the $200 mark now despite that being at least a 60% premium compared to last week — everybody expects a second offer will have to come in near a $200 valuation to be competitive with the 40% premium offer.  AZNs competitors will happily hit that premium to take the $500M/year that AZN says they can get from ALXN (a hard $1B/y swing between AZN and the bidding war opponent). 

*Part 4: ALXN $160 resistance*

How do I know there’s $160 resistance? ALXN 12/18 $160c FD just barely won’t print and I wanted to know why. If it is what I saw when I looked, we’re talking dumb resistance that is definitely gonna disappear and looks to be breaking.

The higher [price targets](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ALXN/price-target/) before the merger were about $160, so a bunch of whales started selling off because their standing orders were all near or just below the old price target. Some of it was general profit-taking too, but for sure with a 30% jump already it isn’t like any of them were going to take a loss and there was a practical guarantee of an extra 10% in half a year which is a return every boomer dreams about — these resisting boomers will realize the new $200 price target is very reasonable then stop selling below $160 and soon. They might be dumb and sell at 2x AZN + $60, but when the market sees AZN’s vaccine it will go up.

*Part 5: TLDR and move ideas*
AZN vaccine is made for global distribution unlike PFE, as long as the calls can theta longer than the market remains irrational they will see 2x the growth of AZN by using calls on ALXN, the standing offer from AZN is free insurance, and you get ALXN just before a bidding war.

poots are just premiums, long and maybe ITM calls instead. The company will likely be merged before q4 next year so ALXN 5/21 $170c or ALXN 5/21 $155c.

I knew I was screwed when I got all the blessing from you guys <3 gonna hold til Daddy Powell speaks _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AUPH set for fireworks in January I’ll give y’all this one for free. Aurinia pharmaceuticals is a small Canadian company with a flagship drug, voclosporin awaiting US FDA review and approval after its phase 3 trial. Voclosporin is a drug designed to treat lupus nephritis which, if untreated or poorly treated, leads to kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis and/or death. I do happen to be an internal medicine provider and can tell you the current treatment for lupus nephritis is very limited, though I am admittedly no expert on this. The potential market is a few billion dollars annually just in US market. The good news is voclosporin is in under “urgent review” meaning it’s review schedule got pushed up due to positive phase 3 results and the target date is January 22, 2021. I did review their most recent summit presentation and the reported results are very encouraging. You may start looking around and see that volclosporin got shot down for dry eye recently, fear not. They are just searching for off label uses. They also have been testing its efficacy against covid. 

Now, that is all fine and dandy. And I’ve been seeing pharm companies rocket on news like this, G L S I anyone? This kind of news triggers immediate and enormous buying, that much is irrefutable. But the pharm game is for sure a casino. In fact I just got burned putting my hand a little too close to O D T. A few pieces of news are gravitating me closer to this company though. First, AUPH leased a 17k square feet manufacturing site 20 miles from the CDC about three months ago. That would suggest they are preparing for rapid uptake in production very soon. Second, they recently bolstered an agreement with Lonza in Switzerland to also prep for huge production in the next few years. Lastly, they hired Peter Greenleaf as CEO of the company. Greenleaf is an artist at pharmaceutical company buy outs (which I see happening in 2021 possibly assuming flagship approval). All of this has me caught up in the possibilities of Christmas in January.

Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

He is the co-founder/chairman and largest shareholder in Palantir. Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.

He loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it’s nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won’t take your money. 

But by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon’s Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  

And on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.

https://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel

Look, if you don’t give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets. The only way to hold the apocalypse at bay is to invest in a few genius level people who can change the world and create millions of jobs and the best way to do that is to give all your money to Peter Thiel.

Hello dear Retards,

Here a DD for you about Solution 30 $S30, this is a European company specialized in solutions for new technologies. Mainly they offers a service to install new materials in companies by technicians of there company. This company has been an incredible success in 15 years, with insane growth !

Introduced on the open market in 2005 for 4.5 million €. In July 2020, capitalization was in the € 1.4 billion range.
Between splits and dilutions, the stock made a good 140 baggers.

Solutions 30 recorded third-quarter revenues of 212.6 million euros, up 28.6%, and up 24% like-for-like. For the first nine months of the year, the company's sales totaled 576.3 million euros, up 19.1%, with organic growth of 12.7%

But the company has been attacked by Muddy Waters, it seems they have realised a false report of a hundred pages circulating in the square, a report that seeks to demonstrate troubled links between the company and organized crime in Italy.

Last week the company asked to suspend its quotation in order to take time to respond to these accusations. But yesterday the company asked to get back in quotation, and they have launched a counter attack :

Everyone who tuned into the earnings call last week was annoyed that GME management did not even comment on Cohen's now-infamous letter. However, listening to Ackman talking about activist investing at [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGatQk1JSas&t=420s) does shed a bit of light onto why this is. 

Ackman says that often companies will refuse to comment on activist investor requests. If the management directly comments on a proposal, then event-driven investors (like 90% of the autists here) will buy in in droves. If this happens and there is a proxy contest down the line, the activist investor will win as he/she will be backed by the event-driven investors. i.e. George Sherman didn't comment on Cohen, as he doesn't want to lose his job.

Anyone with half a brain cell probably realised from the earnings call, especially with the option for GME to issue more shares, that they are scared of a takeover. That's why we heard 'omnichannel' a trillion times, to suggest that GME are shifting to e-commerce without directly talking about Cohen's strategy.

Lastly, it has been noted here a few times that GME won't need to use the shelved shares. Gamestop is currently sitting on $500 million cash and so just don't need the extra capital. They will only exercise the right if they spot a Cohen hostile takeover, meaning it won't affect the share price greatly. 

Remember it's also Q4 earnings, not Q3, that matter.

Cant think of anything that could stop this run. So someone else already mentioned that Sonos is on the run after signing a deal with Legrand today. That happened 1h before market close, why does it matter? Well most traders start closing their positions around 3pm, not opening the new ones. I believe that we will have a massive delayed reaction tomorrow, it only popping up 8% today (those who trade mid caps know that’s very minuscule run on such news). SONO cap is 2B and average trading volume is 4.5mil. Today volume was 8.5mil which isn’t too impressive (after earnings it ran 30% on 44mil vol). 

On top of that, technicals (yes I know I’ll be shamed) adding up nicely, it’s above all the moving averages, on a clear upwards trend and has cleared previous resistance during daytime trading. 

I know us lot on here love short squeezes, but Sonos short position is only 5% of stocks float. In this particular situation it’s actually a good thing since after crushing earnings and now adding a subscription service they are progressing to tendie town. No shorts means very few doubters. Very few doubters mean we are going to have a lovely uptrend without much resistance. Not even mentioning that the stock is trading in less than 2x sales. Amazing bargain even after a great month. 

All four newest analyst ratings that came out on 11/19 and 10/15 are a Buy. After today’s catalyst, which is a major financial event for this company, we should hear  about more upgrades within a week or so. At least that’s what I noticed analysts like to do... 

Final point I’d like to make is that this play is not dependent on Covid news. It’s neither stay at home or reopening play. Why is that great? It is not dependent on general market whims and the run should not be spoiled by some odd Covid news._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Index rebalancing. Do not be long this Friday. This week will see the inclusion of $TSLA into the SNP. Typically how this works is when a stock is added to the index, another company comes out. The market cap of the new company is usually larger than the exiting one. Since the S&P 500 index is market cap weighted, the weightings of all the other stocks need to come down to make room for the new company.

**Tesla will enter the SNP as the 7th largest stock.** This has never occurred before.

This means that an absolutely massive amount of equity, $50 Billion +, has to be sold to make room for it.

The table below shows the current weighting of the largest SNP stocks and amount of equity to be sold, with the largest being $AAPL.

**Big institutions are getting out as everyone is FOMO'ing in.**

They will support this market into Friday and buy any small dips in order to keep the buying going whilst they get out.

As of yesterday afternoon I am mostly short with my only long positions $PSTH, and some Uranium and energy.  Do not trade your money into the hands of these players, you can always get back in next week, the market won't run away from you in 3 days.

Wish me luck. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NESTLE long term investment The Swiss company is focusing its business on climate protection and higher profitability.

Climate protection cannot wait. Food giant Nestle has set itself tight targets. By 2050, the Swiss company wants to achieve "green zero," meaning that its entire business should be climate-neutral. This goes along the entire supply chain. Starting with arable farming, which is being converted to soil-conserving production, and extending to the 800 Nestle sites that use green electricity. In addition, 200 million trees are planted and renaturation is promoted. In five years, all packaging should be recyclable or reusable. Nestle is investing 3.2 billion Swiss francs in this. The stock market reacted cautiously. The Swiss share price even slipped below the 100-franc mark. Investors fear that Nestle will not be able to offset the investment with efficiency gains as planned.

efficiency gains as planned. This would ultimately reduce profits. The concern seems exaggerated. The issue of sustainability is becoming increasingly important, and good money can be earned with healthy food. Nestle grows through innovations and acquisitions. Anything that is not profitable is sold, as was the case with the rice porridge business in China. The water business in North America is also up for sale. New areas such as vegan and vegetarian products and the Health Science division with products to support health are achieving double-digit growth rates. Most recently, Aimmune, a US company developing therapies for food allergies, was acquired. The deal, which is the biggest of the year so far, will certainly not be the last. The Swiss are making faster than expected progress 

faster than expected. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted sales rose 3.5 percent to 61.9 billion Swiss francs. The strong coffee business, which accounts for about a quarter of total sales, and rising online revenues more than offset declining restaurant sales. For the full year, Nestle is now confident of achieving organic growth of around three percent. The analysts at Berenberg have included Nestle in their list of top picks from the sustainability sector. They not only trust the Swiss to achieve a green zero. They also see a price potential of up to 122 francs.

**TLDR:  100c 12/2021**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR was the golden egg that retail sniffed out before it could hatch 1.86 billion fully diluted PLTR shares become unrestricted at the end of next month.

We should expect more price manipulation on this stock until institutions have their hands on these remaining shares at the price they want.      Big money hates Karp for going direct listing on PLTR and depriving them of their guaranteed ten bagger by IPOing this.  The fact that retail got in on the ground floor and started bringing the price up months early, before they could secure their billion shares, has forced them into overtly manipulating the shit out of the price with admin level control.

Morgan Stanley followed up on the Citron hit piece tweet by trying to induce panic by aggressively algo shorting their shares against market at all hours and they will continue to do so until those restricted shares become available for them to purchase, at a price they would prefer.

This is a multi-decadal shadowy Government big data and surveillance company with the most advanced inter-agency data analytics platform currently in use at every Federal department. Sticky customers with pockets that don't end.  Try to tell me a food delivery app is worth more.

**TLDR:** Street wanted an invite only house party and retail drunkenly found the venue before it started and started popping bottle with their friends.  Ease up on buying 10000 weekly OTM options until the lockup, you are only supporting the heavy price suppression.  Until then PLTR is a literal casino, in that the house always wins.  Doesn't mean you can't get lucky though.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Think these will print in the morning? $900 yolo (APHA) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Don't Touch $SPCE Good evening, everyone! I know we're in a little bit of a milieu this week, between the Palantir and GameStop hype these last few weeks and the $MT steel stonk parade we're going to be seeing starting next week. I figured I'd take this time to talk about everyone's good friend Virgin Galactic

Now, I know. The stock's down a quarter after their test fiasco. But what's the long-term outlook? Is it going to the moon, and then back again in time to get the latest billionaire back for chicken tendie lunch? Or will it go tits-up and crash into the Mojave Desert? I suspect the latter. Here's why:

1. **The market is very niche.** There's 2,095 billionaires, according to [the first thing on Google](https://howmuch.net/articles/world-map-of-billionaires-2020), and 46.8 millionaires [according to ABC.](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/half-worlds-entire-wealth-hands-millionaires/story?id=66440320). So, seems like a pretty big market right?

Well, maybe. But maybe not. The initial price for a ticket was $250,000 per seat. That's a lot of money to have in cash. A lot to blow on a fun afternoon sight-seeing flight, and I really doubt most millionaires will have that to spend. So I'm going to make a really unscientific guesstimate and strike that number down by 3/4. So we're down to a market audience of about 12 million.

Next, we'll have to ask ourselves: who really wants to go to space? I do, but I don't have a quarter of a million dollars lying around. Google showed 400 people have pre-ordered tickets, but that only required a $1,000 deposit, and that's about as reliable a metric as the 14,000 people who ordered the Nikola Badger. These are early adopters, sure, but space operations need revenue and revenue requires a large market.

2. **Okay (for) Boomers?** of our millionaire and billionaire market, 99% are over 35. The average age for a millionaire is 62, and of course greater wealth skews older. The average billionaire is 65. Now, the oldest person in space was 77, so these guys should be okay right? Well, that 77 year old was Sen. John Glenn, former Marine fighter pilot and first American to orbit the Earth.  Probably better shape than most of his peers and he was just along for the ride when he went up at 77.  Nasa astronauts generally max out at about 46 years old. If you're just a tourist and you're not going to touch anything, you can definitely go older, but how much older?

Are you going to risk a 65 year-old, in average health? How about a 75 year-old? Or someone in poor health? What's the chance some old guy dies from a heart attack right as you reach the exosphere? Does VG have insurance for the oncoming lawsuit? How much does this eat into profits? If higher insurance rates jack up the price, how much does that reduce the market size?

Or say it's not safe, for at least a while, for the average >65 year old to go into space. Is VG going to cut over half their market, or are they going to pay way higher insurance premiums and suffer ensuing lower margins for these people?

3. **Perception** Branson isn't Musk.  He doesn't have the charisma, the sympathetic vision, or the memes. He's like Daniel Boone's less successful cousin Cleetus, who'd follow behind on blazed trails, getting the stumps out. People will be less excited by his successes, less forgiving of failures. And failures, with crewed aircraft,, are going to kill confidence. VG can't exactly re-enact that [SpaceX falcon crash montage](https://youtu.be/bvim4rsNHkQ) when every shot potentially results in the death of 8 people.

4. **Volatility** Imagine getting your entire call portfolio chewed up by IV. Yuck. But we're going to see a pattern with this stock: it shoots up before a test and crashes afterwards. A catastrophic failure will tank it. Can try to time shares, and just go for short-term gains, but the whole stock is at the mercy of the weather. Sure you can hold long, but as I said I don't see much of a future for this company.

5. **Disappointment in WSB** as far as I've seen, nobody's even said *$SPCE Jam* yet. Frankly I should've put this first, it's the inspiration for this whole post.

So that's my opinion, feel free to comment and tell me how I'm wrong, I'll appreciate it.

Any thoughts? 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How bullish 0% interest rate world really is - Answer: VERY BULLISH Good evening legends,

The following post will be brief. This post will setup my framework and over the next few days I'm going to be posting my DDs on the stocks I've invested in if there is interest.

# TLDR: I am FULLY SENDING IT - below is WHY.

**Aphorism 1:** "STONKS only go up" - WSB legends

* I am a true believer of things improving over time. My plays are stocks and leaps due to tax advantages and frankly the humility that came along with trying to time the top/bottom and failing on multiple occasions.

**Aphorism 2:** "History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes." - Mark Twain

* What are the top 3 countries with the lowest interest rates?
   * Switzerland: maintained the same interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EWL ETF over those 5 years? 10% with 61% total return.
   * Denmark: maintained 0% to negative \~1% interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EDEN ETF over those 5 years? 12.78% with 82.43% total return.
   * Japan: has been fucked for a long time, everybody knows it. EVENTHOUGH FUCKED - annualized return of EWJ over the past 5 years? 8.22% with 48.46% total return.
* The Federal Reserve indicates it will not raise rates for years. It will leave the interest rates around 0% until 2023. What does this mean? Long equity, any equity and if you want to short something don't short fucking TESLA short BANKS. My favorite bank to short is Goldman Sachs, because I like Bernard Baruch not a retard that calls himself DJ Sol.

**Aphorism 3:** "The odds are either 100% or 0%, and we just don't know which." - one of my legendary friends

* The fundamental risk at the moment is, the FED's statement of keeping interest rates low is not binding. I am betting that they will stay at 0% but again the statement is NOT BINDING.

You've probably seen a lot of posts recently about various commodities blowing up - first was silver gang, now steel gang. I'm here to tell you about a few more gangs, and also introduce you to the Commodity Club. [Welcome](https://tenor.com/oZx3.gif). Please add your insight and input.

**^(Second)** ^(\*\*Disclaimer\*\*:)

*I'm your 26 year old boomer autist who has religiously followed commodities since middle school (15+ years. I've played the ups (made lots and downs (lost lots of most commodities on the market and know there's others like me out there.) I'm here to tell you that no matter how you play commodities, you are about to make a lot of money.))*

I have about $200k invested. I'm also not going to do any technical analysis for you - this is going to be introductory, and I'll let future members of the commodity club dive into the details.

**Info**: If [this](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodities) isn't your internet home page, it's okay. I recommend you go to settings and quickly swap out Elon's twitter for commodities as your default home page.

One thing you'll notice on this lovely website is that it's color coded. I've purposely chosen this site for you retards over more technical sites because you can tell good (green) from bad (red). What you should immediately notice is that there's lots of green in the "Monthly" and "YTD" columns. If you did your own DD and went a layer deeper, you'd immediately notice graphs like the following:

# STOP - Read!

The list goes on - Rubber, Lumber, Tin, Soybeans, Platinum, Propane, etc. Take a look for yourself to get the picture. Commodities go BOOM.

However, unlike your normal stocks, commodities don't do a 1 year window. Cycles go for years - both booms and busts, and I'll give you a smattering of a few key commodities to illustrate that point.

# Those 1 year and 10 year graphs show a few key things:

1. **Commodity cycles are rarely a flash in the pan**
2. **Commodities are still undervalued**
3. **Almost all commodities are trending up**

You would think that commodities going up would mean that commodity stocks are overvalued. I mean commodities in general are expensive now! Check out this Bloomberg commodity index to get an idea of how expensive commodities are:

&#x200B;

[Commodity Index](https://preview.redd.it/0i3q4a2s0g561.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab4b35e1fbb7b2d8a93249e46937ac09f902ba7)

We are about 25% away from the peak! We can't zoom much further. Steel gang and Silver gang go bust. But wait - this is Commodity club and we are looking to make money. Why would this post be some gay bear shit.

Here's a graph showing stock values between the S&P and Commodity Index (that thing you just learned about) since the 1970s:

WOW! The commodity index has never been so undervalued! What does this mean??

^(\*\*Third disclaimer\*\*:)

*I'm a firm believer that the world is entering the biggest commodity cycle we will ever know that will reset expectations on global commodity prices and last for at least a decade.*

*What will drive this is a rapidly deteriorating global fiat currency (check your DXY charts* [*here*](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-DXY/)*), low interest rates creating an incentive to grow and build, emerging economies like Brazil and India becoming net importers of commodities, China's rapid growth, a modernizing infrastructure (electric railroad/planes, wind turbine tankers, hyperloops, space travel), investment in EVs (and subsequently batteries) and the infrastructure to support it, and stumbling economies in need of increased stimulus through infrastructure spending.*

*Supply and demand as we know it is about to swing massively, and you'll want to get in front of it. Commodities are what will bring us to new heights.*

Commodity stocks are grossly undervalued compared to the spot price of their underlying commodities. There's a few definitions/key things you need to know:

* Spot Price: The current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and deliver.
* Futures Price: The prices at which an asset can be bought or sold for delivery in the future.
* Commodity companies often sell futures to lock in prices at a known rate.
* Miners often play multiple commodities.

# Here's a few examples you've seen in recent WSB posts:

* VALE ($17) - Brazilian miner who produces about 300 million tons of iron ore each year. They also produce Nickel.
   * Iron ore futures currently trade at \~ $150/ton. Last time iron ore futures were going into a bull market and hit $150/ton was in May 2010. VALE was trading in the $25-30 range.
   * VALE just partially opened a previously closed mine to try to increase production to take advantage of prices.
* MT ($23) - Indian steel producer who produces about 92 million tons of steel each year.
   * Steel futures currently trade at \~ $640/ton. Steel has traded at this level for the past 5 years where MT traded in the $20-40 range.
   * This is not accounting for spot steel, which you've read about being much higher priced.

# Here's a few examples you haven't seen in recent WSB posts:

* TECK ($18) - Canadian Copper and Zinc miner with mines in Canada/Chile.
   * Copper futures currently trade at \~ $3.5/pound. Last time copper futures were going into a bull market and hit $3.5/pound, TECK hit $60 when copper ran up to $4.5/pound.
   * Teck has great relationships with China and is opening one of the largest copper mines in the world next year.
   * When copper hit $4/pound in 2010, TECK announced a $5/share special dividend.
   * TECK is trading at a discount compared to competitors as they used to be invested in Oil sands, but they divested and are focused on Copper and Zinc now (and asphalt on the side).
* ARCH ($46) - American Coking Coal producer; coking coal is different than thermal coal and used in steel plants
   * ARCH started trading in late 2016 and was very profitable and at $90/share. Covid shut down steel plants nationwide causing massive losses in Q1-Q3 2020.
   * Coal futures recently hit $80+/ton, and are expected to increase. ARCH already sold 20% of their 2021 production at $90/ton per their Q3 quarterly report, which is what coal traded at when ARCH was at $90/share. I read the report for you to know it's a rock solid company that's going to kill Q4 earnings.
   * ARCH has a classic cup/handle setup over the past few months. TA that shit.

These stocks have a 100% upside at current commodity prices if stocks were to return to their 2010 valuations. However, unlike 2010, we have more tailwinds prompting commodity pricing questions. Commodity bull markets last for years, and our current global setup looks like we are at just the beginning of the largest commodity bull market in history. Global demand is increasingly massively, and production can't keep up. 2021 will be the beginning of the biggest commodity shock you'll see in your lifetime.

**Plays**: Because you autists like to be told how to invest your money, I have good news for you - commodity stock options are CHEAP. IV is between 40-60%, and you can buy options below their actual value from boomers collecting dividends and playing thetagang on the side. Most major miners we expect will announce earnings in Feb 2021.

I'm currently playing the following:

* TECK - Feb 21 @ 20c
* VALE - June 21 @ 25c
* ARCH - May 21 @ 55c

I've also sold about $70k in deep ITM puts in December/January to build equity as I want to own shares for the upcoming bull market._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [VLDR] There are No Flying Cars in Your Future, but Self Driving Cars are for Real. $30 by March 2021. Then we really 🚀 🚀 afterwards Are you a fan of The Jetsons? No? You are not some old ass boomer and therefore, you don’t even know what The Jetsons are?

Ok, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).

But I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.

However, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.

**Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**

Oh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months. 

1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesn’t have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they don’t want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intel’s Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.

2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.

3. Companies like Amazon and Walmart spend tons of money on deliveries and it requires them to hire a lot of drivers. In their relentless effort to cut cost, Amazon is looking into other methods of deliveries such as drones. Deliveries via self driving vehicles is simply another avenue that they will explore in their pursuit of increasing their profit so Bezos can get richer.

4. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.

**What is LiDAR and why should I care?**

Think of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, that’s what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.

**Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**

Well, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).

They are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, there’s an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.

With their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intel’s Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.

But the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range. 

Velodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.

Additionally, they can upsell to its existing customers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodyne’s software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodyne’s ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers. 

Today, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.

**Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**

Well, you greedy bastard. This company’s growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.

1. Revenue Growth: Velodyne’s projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024. 

2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.

3. Gross Margin: Velodyne’s gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.

4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodyne’s revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.

5. Amazon’s Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodyne’s LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDR’s LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.

**TL;DR**

Conclusion:

1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.

2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZR’s market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they don’t have bullshit “research turned into production” deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.

3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, it’s still not too late for you to get in.

Target Price: $30 by March 2021. After that, it moons.

I posted about Aphria’s great outlook 2 weeks ago. It has a buy rating with an $11 fair market value (currently at $8.90). This was before merger talks. Please read my review in my past posts and decide if it’s right for you. 

I’ll do my research on Tilray and write a new DD if I think it will be worth while._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Someone bought 50,000 Tesla Jan 15 puts on friday It is Jan 15 $20 puts, that's what really surprising...

The average volume on those options are 5-30 per day, then I saw 50,000. I thought it was a glitch, because open interest didn't change, it was 102,000. Then on Monday I saw open interest increase to 152,000.

Anyway, 50,000 options is  $50,000 bet, I wonder who and why made that bet?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
